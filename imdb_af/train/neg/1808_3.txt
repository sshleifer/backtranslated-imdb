In his 1966 movie "Blow Up", Antonioni questioned his hero's truth testimony against a backdrop of British youth protesters. By putting such questions against a substance of hippy youth movements, Antonioni deliberately or not questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a case when what you think is true, maybe a lie? On the other hand, the film said that we have to fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others mislead us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the most difficult parts of Blow Up, they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it would otherwise have. It was a very careful and mature movie. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes completely blown away. The result is a film experience with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and storytelling stories. How can someone who shows such self-control and intelligence about his career make something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film opens with a nice series of close ups, as we look at a group of radicals who discuss the meaning of revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) gets up and goes out. He hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution. He admits that although revolutionary fighting for freedom, he commits himself to such a militant cause, to give you freedom effectively. And like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger" Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and goes solo. He does not take orders from anyone. When police attack his university campus, Mark shoots a man and walks away. He then flees to a nearby airport, steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia, contrasting with the relentless capitalist cities, with their billboards and hollow modern devices. He sees the desert as a kind of garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love. Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free of the limitations of modern life, these tree crawlers and student radicals can celebrate their individualism by hopping in the sun. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasizes about the bloat of homes and stately homes of wealthy capitalists who killed him. This is Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Pick up the guns, peaks and explosives, he says. Tear off the walls before they get you in the hands! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film had no influence on his audience. They recognized "Zabriskie Point" as just another self-centered commercial effort to be radical. A kind of communicated radicalism. It felt false and soft. <br /> <br /> Themes are pretty silly. Antonioni basically says that if you are dissatisfied with the modern world, and the fat cats that exploit you, you must flee to the desert or fight the system (Daria). This is all good and good. But while artists are constantly warning us of such dystopic nightmares, they are mostly unable to show us how to manage the change effectively. Like the end of the "Fight Club", nihilism and violence reach nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be motivated by humble inventors, prompted by slight technological advances. I mean, what frees women more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is, Antonioni doesn't really believe in rebellion. He is a quiet and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted movie, just got more worship from the counter-culture that embraced his earlier film, "Blow Up". As such, "Zabrinskie Point" comes across as a very pretentious and silly movie. It's actually a 50-year-old man saying "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films in which the audience is encouraged to "fight the system", but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All this shows that the lives of freedom all fight in failure, but in each case survive the "spirit of revolution". The message is that you cannot bring about change, but through death or failure, the optimistic idea of ​​change survives through martyrdom. In essence, we must continue to fail rather than give up hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down" that just encourage you to explode. Tear it all down. Blow it all up. Everything is a lie, so you might as well burn out guns. These films are carried out of anger, reactionary feelings, rather than any kind of common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "flight rather than fighting". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Movies such as "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show people who diverge from the world that they don't like and forge islands or peaceful ports. Both directors are pessimists, as Malick has destroyed his islands and Antonioni has his islands without any sense of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Movies like Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others", Ashby's "Bound For Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange", treat artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, where everyone is happy to be a slave to the state, it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artist / criminals who control the system. By simply living outside the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical eye challenge the status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film undermined writers and artists Nazi Germany, while Kubrick Alex fought the artist / criminal to fight Nazi dry and paint the city in blood and sperm.
