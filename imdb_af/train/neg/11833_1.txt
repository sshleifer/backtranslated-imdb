So don't even consider renting it out of the stores because it's one hell of a bad movie. You would think that JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, a rat is flushed in the toilet and somehow needs to come back. Fans of the horrible "Shrek" may be enjoying, but "Wallace & Gromit" fans will probably be horrified. Also, why didn't they do it in plastic or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For a NATHMAN movie ?? !! Clearly, Aardman was walking around while doing Dreamworks the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every character is horrible, apart from the freaky frog, who is just right for a movie killer. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with boredom and watched this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep with boredom and watch this movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately it's not as bad as "Shrek."
