Perhaps this is the roughest performance of Santa Claus ever dedicated to any medium, whether it's a book, picture or movie. Santa looks like a perverted look on the kids and the twisted story to bring in Merlin to help him beat one of Satan's minions, Pitch, doesn't make things better. It's ridiculous to say the least, with bad effects, even for 1959 standards. If a child had to watch this movie, he had nightmares and he never wanted to visit Santa. They will be afraid of life. Imagine that the child is in a Christmas story when they start shouting after they are put on the Christmas shot. So it will show if the child sees this movie.
