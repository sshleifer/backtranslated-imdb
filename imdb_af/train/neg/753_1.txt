Wow ... <br /> <br /> I picked it at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it was released early. I've been following it for some time now and just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really struck me was editing, or lacking it. Every time, characters (usually the narrator and whoever he is) are shown to walk ... and walk ... and walk. I'm not an editor, but I know you can cut between someone who leaves point A to show they arrive at point B. There is almost no need to show the whole journey! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I actually felt a bit sorry for the actors involved. They have apparently given no direction on what to do during plays other than to look scared or to look happy, depending on what action to add later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why it's decided to do almost all of the effects using CG is outside of me. Even ILM sometimes uses miniature sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the ongoing ending of (at the end of the credits) the same group of people who represent the citizenship of different towns and cities, including London. Sometimes these people come up with anything or the angle of the shot or the distance they come from the camera. In one shot in London there appear to be at least two men over six feet long walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG I have seen such a false face hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Hines spoke this movie as he did is out of my mind. It's a turkey, simple and simple. On the positive side (at least for me) it has taken care of some of the most sincere, laughable pieces I've already seen.
