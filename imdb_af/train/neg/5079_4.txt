What a great actor has in such a terrible story ... <br /> <br /> The movie and its production, however, is pretty good, though in London, but with foreigners in Bristol. Does not matter ?? see one cathedral, you saw everything. Similar. <br /> <br /> The story, however, is about a man born with the power to kill and destroy anyone and anything. will. With just a passing reference to true living settings of telekinesis, the story builds a photograph of a man who is abusive and misjudged as a boy, teenager and ultimately a man; so much, in fact, that he literally wants to exercise revenge. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is in the wrong way and thus destroys the lot ?? just by thinking about it! <br /> <br /> The trouble with the story, however, is that it mixes real scientific data on strange spiritual forces and merges it all with a quasi-religious clapping force to produce a hodge-podge theory about it all. Mixing fact and fantasy in this way seldom works? and I'm afraid Richard Burton had to deal terribly on some occasions when he tried to convince. His very best scene, however, was when he gave his wife and her lover an oral package when they left his home: sharp, witty and deadly dialogue, just like Burton could. <br /> <br /> A good supporting role helps to make things look good and sound, but start with Lino Ventura, which I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), as Brunel's inspector; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; the much-underrated Lee Remick as dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as a publisher, Towney, and some other well-known characters. <br /> <br /> I like the way the story is presented, as flashback in flashback to fill in the back story to solve the immediate riddle. from the attempted murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), the author with the killer's mindset. Until then, it was a good piece of visual research by Brunel and his English sidekick. Yet it was very predictable, as it quickly became very clear to me about the identity of the killer. <br /> <br /> In the past fifteen minutes, they spoiled everything. If you want an idea of ​​what it is, think Samson and Delilah (1949), of illustrious Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson has the bad guys. And the last scene is just stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways in which Morlar's cancellation could be stopped. <br /> <br /> Shame, actually, because it could have been a much better story and movie. I think Burton really needs the money. <br /> <br /> If you're a Burton fan, spend the time watching the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, don't bother.
