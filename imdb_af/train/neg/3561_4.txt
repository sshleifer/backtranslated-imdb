Stephen King adaptation (written by King himself) in which a young family, newcomers in rural Maine, find out about the pet cemetery near their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out about the Micmac cemetery outside the pet cemetery that has resurrection powers. Only of course anything buried there is not quite right. <br /> <br /> Under the average "horror" picture begins clumsy, insulting and improper, and remains for a while, with the absolute worst element that Midkiff's worthless performance is. It gets a little better at the end, with really disturbing finals. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, and so I can't completely dismiss it - at least it has something to remember. Good supporting performances by Fred Gwynne, such as the sensible older neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as the mutilated spirit Victor Pascow, are not enough to really release film. <br /> <br /> King came as a minister. </p> <p> br /> <br /> Followed by a sequel who was also directed by Mary Lambert (is it a wonder she hasn't had a mainstream movie ever since?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
