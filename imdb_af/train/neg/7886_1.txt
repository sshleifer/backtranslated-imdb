I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night, I think. But what really seems to me is when the entry on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Leaving religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I were a religious person, I would agree with most of the other posters. This movie was a mess. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited, and attempted soundtrack were hilarious. The false accent was terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and continuity was out of the window. The only reason we spent this tedious time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Just went to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no redeeming features for this movie, unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will tell your faith to the unbelievers, even if it is a waste of waste. If you are not, avoid it at all costs. Don't be fooled by writing the box.
