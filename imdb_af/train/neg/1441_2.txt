I selected this movie on the cover alone and thought I was an adventure for the level of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom. Unfortunately I was in for a virtual gay. Not like any gift I've had before. This gift was so great that I could hardly find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described incredible special effects. There was no one. The film was so lightweight that even the stereotypes are portrayed differently. It gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids it. I don't. Keep away from this one. If you're looking for family entertainment, you might find something else that inspires more.
