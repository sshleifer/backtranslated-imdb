Left behind is an incredible waste of over $ 17 million. The acting is poor and uninspiring, the story is even worse. The audience is asked to believe the totally unquestionable and very laudable plot line and give nothing in return for their good faith. Not only did the film perform poorly and it is written in all the technical areas of film filming. The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are totally unpredictable and flat. The lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably terrible; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. However, it will not matter that millions of families will undoubtedly embrace the film, because it is health and that is religious handrails; and who can blame them? However, it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd-class amateur movies.
