There is a terrible mistake with this picture, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist escaping to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She is immediately punished by a locally improper (Craig Sheffer), who seems to be trying a third of Mickey Rourke's imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman who is supposed to be there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, does the script manipulate the audience to whom the right man is? Logic flies out of the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think "Blue Desert" can be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you'll be disappointed. His part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - NOTE
