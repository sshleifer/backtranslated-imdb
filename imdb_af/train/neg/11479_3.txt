This movie deserves another bad review. Consider a reviewer raising the film's virtues, including "no sex, violence, or gore." Uh, excuse me. Setting up the film saw us as Cody's young comrade, with love for life and who has everything to live, is being blown off to let Cody flee his lifeless, bloody body. And, given the nature of the war, we know that Cody has seen abomination almost daily. So much for those who watch this movie with such goggles is that the violence that Cody's persona defines is removed from the viewer memory. <br /> <br /> Just about any family of his own Cody, such as John Rambo, walks the country on his bike making the long haul to hometown USA in the guise of a place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged goods. We know this since his CO has practically declared him, as he advises Cody to get a rest from the death and destruction of the war. This explains, since Cody's striking 'flat' effect doesn't look remarkable or cautious. It's not bad. This is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder. Don't guess here, remember his CO ordered him from the battlefield. <br /> <br /> What about those 'casual' kisses as seen by another review. The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly did Cody respect 'Faith' by touching her and knowing she was well spoken? Now it was a non-family value moment. A moment then announced on the immediate universe as if it was posted on YouTube. Of course, faith decay and Cody's "come" to a woman who intends to marry another, in the spirit of the Christmas season, all who desire their grief and lips. <br /> <br /> We know little of Faith's fianc√©, except that she loves her love for him, she takes no more than a nano-second to accept his proposal (could have waited for any second thoughts) , he is generous, he loves her, the family has nothing Really against him he believes marriage is compromised and the two never discussed the marriage plans. No malicious people here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a good actor who is given the hill dialogue, like "we love your son ...." "You are part of our family's literal days after they have a met stranger. named Cody. And the "band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all, was never meant to apply for virtual aliens from the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This movie is cotton cake Xmas-fluff running on betraying great ways. Most rough when it regrets Cody's disrespect for faith by physically hitting her and knowing what she is talking about. Redefining family as we know it, we accept a virtual stranger as a full-fledged love member of family because we all love you, how many of you did or know someone who did it.
