Ulli Lommel's 1980 movie "The Boogey Man" is not classical, but it is an above average low budget parent who is worth it. The successor, 1983's "Boogey Man II", is ultimately a waste of time, but at least it is an entertaining one if it is not least taken seriously. Now I left the door open for another successor, and I wouldn't even want to see it. One day while watching all the videos at a mall in the mall, I made a movie entitled 'Return of the Boogey Man'. When I found out, it was a sequel to previous films. I was fortunate to cover a few bucks for it. I needed to know better. Although the opening title is 'Boogey Man 3', it is not a sequel to the two far superior movies I mentioned above. Well, not quite. <br /> <br /> For: Ha! It's a laugh. Is there anything good about this famine of cow man? Let's see ... it has footage from 'The Boogey Man' and, um ... it's gracious short. Yes, it's about it. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First of all, this movie is a total drill. It goes from one scene to the next without anything happening in the distant or frightening way. The acting is at its best rigid. The "actors" are probably the friends of the director who previously had no acting experience, and probably not since then. The plot is inconsistent and the dissertation is written. The direction is just terrible. The director is trying to make the movie look like everything, by making the camera move, light flashing and with filters, but it doesn't add anything. The music is boring and difficult to hear in parts. Drops on the original are blocked. Suzanna Love's character is called Lacey, not Natalie! And the events depicted at the beginning of the original did not occur in 1978. If there is a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Lastly, it doesn't add anything new or interesting to the series or genre. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: The people behind this time and money waste should be ashamed. This is one thing if it was an original movie that was the director's first and sucked. But instead it is supposed to be a sequel to film that is not a masterpiece, but it is certainly very interesting and entertaining than that. If there is ever another successor, what I doubt it, it must be forgotten that it has ever happened and is handled by Lommel himself or someone who at least has an idea of ​​how to make a decent horror movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
