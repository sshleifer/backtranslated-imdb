I don't think anyone is going to watch this movie, expecting something remotely that looks like a classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you've ever been scared. It doesn't really work on the level, but the player is trying hard and the movie doesn't sound like one of those happy ends. The story is about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and brings his wife, Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett) together. Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) working at the US Consulate helps them find a home to live in and he finds one that haunts. About 140 years earlier in the same house, a Samurai had his wife on him and he killed both and committed suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house and when the Fletcher arrives, strange things don't take long. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes the ghosts live in the bodies of the Fletcher's and begin like the Japanese people they used to be and Laura starts flirting with Alex, which leads to a relationship. Meanwhile, Ted is starting to act harder and after pouring soup into Amy's throat, he is going to ask a monk for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts get Ted, Laura and Alex to play their death scene as it happened 140 years earlier. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Kevin Connor, known as a good television director, but has made horror and science fiction films and worked with some of them with McClure. Although it never comes close to a frightening or developing atmosphere, it has two things I liked. First, it didn't have any of those juicy ends where the couple embraced after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody battle where everyone gives up the ghosts' anger. Secondly, it throws Susan George in! I've always been a fan of her, though she has mostly appeared in sklock, but her performances are always up to date. She usually also appears naked, which she does here in two separate scenes and while she does not have classic features, she has a unique tomboy like watching her and that is one of the reasons she was so popular. But after appearing in dull movies like this, it led me to come out of business or just worked sporadically. It is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and watching the spirits move around when the Monk gives an exuberance is almost a giggle or two worthy. The bottom line is that it's stupid and I hope George decides to resume her career.
