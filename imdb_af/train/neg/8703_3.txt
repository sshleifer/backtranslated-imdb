Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo comes from living dinosaurs. The army commando team must now think quickly, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, rather than the reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and you get your first impressions of the movie. This is pretty much it. The acting is only of a few characters acceptable. The story is poor, with the whole movie based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film came out to Jurassic Park three years ago. Instead, this movie seems to be 13 years ahead of 'Jurassic Park'. The costumes of the dinosaurs are so poorly made, and I mean costumes. Of course people are dressed, and this film makes no effort to hide it. A scene when a dinosaur runs down, is created in a way that seems to drive the creatures. This is one good thing that comes from this movie. The short time. At only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but try to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "It's like a Friday the 13th nightmare." - Officer (Brian Currie)
