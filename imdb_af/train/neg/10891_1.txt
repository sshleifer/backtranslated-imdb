I saw the trailer to this movie and it looks good, so I went out and bought. What a mistake, the acting is a shambles, the special effects (if you can call them) look like something that wouldn't be in place at a school game. Some characters are so stupid in this movie, you will cringe the minute they are on the screen, which is unfortunately too often. As for a story, forget about it. It's a warning, don't waste any money on this movie, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If you're watching this movie for some reason, see Troll 2, you'll enjoy it as well.
