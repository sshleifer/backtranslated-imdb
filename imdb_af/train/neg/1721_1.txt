A Meteorite's Crater Lake (hence our title), which awakens a Plesiosaur, who continues to snack on the bumpy population (in California, that capital of the world.) <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, And then there is "The Crater Lake Monster" which somehow manages to escape MST3K. With lattice work, a decent stopping motion, and more, it's a horrible piece of 1970's low budget exploitation / monster movie drink. <br /> <br /> While the movie is guilty of many crimes, the biggest one is Arnie and Mitch, two unpleasant rednecks that serve as our comic relief. They bump around, fight for "banjo music", invent women and act as pathetic excuses for humanity. The characters are so bad, they have to count as a crime against humanity.
