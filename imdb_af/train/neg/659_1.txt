This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people have been paid to make this piece of litter shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment industry. The idea that audiences have paid to see this movie (and like an idiot I rented the movie) also discourages. <br /> <br /> Obsessive teacher (3 years before) kills teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason did he kill the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad scene and direction. Years later, obsession breaks out teacher from prison. HMM - ordinary bad writing - no one in the town he knows to terrorize until the last moment. Obsessive teacher is somehow like a Navy SEAL and can walk around, sniff people and with a knife is a super killer. Sure !!! Now obsessed teacher killed hotel maid for no reason, knifes hood for its fun, and begins to hunt the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessive teacher sneaks out of hotel --- again it is stupid, ever policeman will know his face - but he runs right next to them. Now he killed two police outside the teenager's house and somehow sneaked into her bedroom and killed her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. If another profession pours out of this low quality, they will be discharged. Yet these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash.
