I was in a movie as I went, and I had absolutely no entertainment except for a murder. I got even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas 1947 A child testifies that his parents are doing it while dad is in a santa suit. Teased, he walks on the stairs and cuts himself. The story starts 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your ordinary everyday guy ..... remember he's passionate about Santa. After his boss loves him, he goes mad, dress like a santa and begins the death of non-santa believers and his boss. A frightened neighborhood comes to him and just as they are going to torch him, he drives his bus off a cliff ..... in the moon. Not the best end I've seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring movie that really had no quality, except when Harry went to churchgoers. There were almost no gore and even the "sex" scenes were burned down. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
