Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything on the show! Well, if the idea doesn't intrigue you, what it shouldn't do, stay away from ringmaster. I have the displeasure to see it in the theater and actually be able to pass through this mess of a movie. I think jerry jumper doesn't play himself as it turns out to be the cheap props for his performance (yes it looks even cheaper than the real Jerry-Springer show) and he's just known as Jerry in the movie. The plot (if you can call it) is about a daughter while she and her mother decide to sleep with the mother's life in a boyfriend. So is the mother's brilliant idea of ​​calling the Jerry-Springer show, as well as getting it up with her daughter's boyfriend. (It happens to be, they live in a trailer). Meanwhile, a woman somewhere in America finds her cheatin 'husband with her girlfriend in bed. So of course America's therapist calls Jerry Springer! I will talk about the rest of the movie, but I even think of the movie, give me a headache. Jamie Pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie. And does Michael Dudikoff remember the kick-ass karate master of the American ninja series? Well, look at him as a white trash drink. The thing is he looks really awful and out of shape to call it "in contact with his charecter". But if your idea is fun, Jerry Springer sees a country song singing about his own show or guys with transvestites. Well, just watch the show in place! ... Steve was at least smart enough to stay out of this movie.
