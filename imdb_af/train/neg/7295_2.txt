First, the reason I gave this movie is 2 stars instead of 1, because Peter Falk has at least given his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars to try to save this otherwise completely worthless effort to make a movie. <br /> <br /> I was initially fired at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie "showing his career." To me, this was the tiring performance of Stevens who totally ruined this movie , and therefore I was all prepared to delete all kinds of insults from the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what did Stevens do more? So I checked and, you know, that person was completely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been using since then, is apparently all shit, so it is unclear that anyone has even seen the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like Columbo, see each of the 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for the last.
