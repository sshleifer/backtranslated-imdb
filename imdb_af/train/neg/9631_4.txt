The movie appeals to the public for the charism of Ben Stiller and the fame of J. Aniston. We seem to have a recipe for a successful title here, but there is nothing successful in this movie. <br /> <br /> Antony plays very well. This is the kind of character that fits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same tough guy as in "Meet the Parents", but in this movie the cartoons are scarce compared to the above title. <br /> <br /> The writing is very poor with nothing special. With these two well-paid actors, things can get much better - but what can they do if there is such a poor story and writing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
