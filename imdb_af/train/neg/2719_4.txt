When a small sphere of space-age land folly lands, it soon begins to use earthly and weight. The only part of this senseless roof I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes that it could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. This thing actually made 20 million dollars? And McQueen's salary was 3K? Everyone was overpaid. The 'monster' looks a lot like a big beanbag and the 'teens' seem to have children that reach their teens. And the storms of the shotgun sound like a gun with a sound suppressor. The end was sadly foolish; Of course the producers left the door open for a prosecution .... and there were many. Thumbs off.
