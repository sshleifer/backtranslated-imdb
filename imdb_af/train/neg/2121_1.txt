Quite frankly, it was also seven hours of boredom. What is it? What about Will Smith I just can't stand? I think he just seems to be heroes to be taken seriously and to get an Oscar. I understand how prejudice it is, but unless he undergoes some new acting, I can never see him win. He is a big name and is generally confused with a talented and diverse actor. He's just not. I give him credit to try so hard, and to cry at the drop of a hat. It's about it. <br /> <br /> From my start, seven pounds was a kind of eyeroller for me. The 911 suicide call didn't irritate me in any way. I was not curious to know why he was suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best thing I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had a bit of decent screen chemistry. I don't know her name either, but the Spanish woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten woman. Woody Harrelson had a very limited screen time, but I want to say he stole the show when he was going. <br /> <br /> All in all, just grinding a mill from the mill. I couldn't help asking the whole way, why I care about any of these people. I never once felt sorry for Tim / Ben. He killed himself with a jellyfish? Was the only survivor in an accident with 8 people? Geewiz .. don't see any of the following ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is pretty generous.
