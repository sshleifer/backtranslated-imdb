If I was asked how I would define the word "Shallow", I would reply "Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production". If I was asked how I would define the phrase "Wasted potential", I would answer "Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production". Bruckheimer productions are almost always sure that fire hits at the box office, but almost always receive critical pannings from the critics. From the top of my head I can only think of an official and a GENTLEMAN and SWART HAWK DOWN, who get a lot of criticism. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE also received some criticism from critics, which is certainly one of Bruckheimer's better films that doesn't say much. The problem I had is the scenario that sets the story up: The Russians fight the Chechens and spread the conflict all over Russia, leading to an ultra-nationalist Russian to persuade a nuclear radio base and threaten the West than they interfere. Perhaps the end of the cold war had everything to do, but I found this setup very unconvincing. It is not helped by a few geographical errors such as the French carrier Foch in the Med. Would the Foch be better placed in the black sea? Or that the exponential news rule consists of family footage with conflicts from the Balkans, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Again the adjective "Very unconvincing" climbed into my mind. The story improves slightly when the story is properly - a will of testaments relating to commands between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - going on. Director Tony Scott does his best, like the movie, but the problem remains in an unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if it was made in the mid-1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - probably not - this movie would have scared me, but after the end of the cold war, the dangers of the nuclear war, which means that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact.
