I am a big horror / plower, I even enjoy horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also like gore. The more the merrier has as long as it has a point. <br /> <br /> After reading the other people's reviews on the site, I was sure this movie would be a little gem. But to my disappointment, it was one of the most senseless movies I ever watched. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogue was stupid, the plot was useless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years. Usually, I find that all these features make a big b horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I turned 11 euros to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you really enjoy the useless gore (for example, the "violent sh * t" movies) avoid at any cost!
