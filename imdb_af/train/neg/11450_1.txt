I got an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to change it in every way they can improve to get it by August 3. It dies Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as Hot Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his father. When we meet him, he jumps a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. It would probably be a Jackass movie if he didn't try to do it honestly. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door, Denise. She looks like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a video camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, who was played by Ian McShane. Frank is a really tough man who enjoys hitting Rod in some real outbreaks. It is clear that Rod will not earn Frank's respect until he can beat him. We find Frank needs a $ 50,000. Heart transplant and Rod are determined to raise the money just so that he can beat his ass as soon as he is healed and prove himself a man. A long fall on a mountain side convinces Rod to give a big bang. Rod suggests getting seed money by asking to do stunts that would shrink if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch - at a children's festival. There were those who managed to laugh at the show. Just when all hope and money is lost, come alongside a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses. Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up telephone lines to receive donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world agrees. Does he make the leap? Does he get the girl? Do they increase the $ 50k? Does Frank beat his ass by Rod? Wait until this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out.
