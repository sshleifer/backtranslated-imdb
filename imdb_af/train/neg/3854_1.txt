Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, with the help of a trusted agent, has great potential. Obviously the person who led her into this travesty is not someone who cares about her career. I surrounded the theater by teenagers who left the thorns, found another movie to wonder if they thought this movie would call someone. It was poorly written, the deciding director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director didn't care.
