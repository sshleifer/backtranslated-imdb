I give these five out of 10. All five points are for Hendrix, who delivers a very decent set of his latest material. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera is working and editing on the terrible! We have many follow-up shots of Hendrix where he can do almost anything and maybe take a pee? We don't see his hands on the guitar that's the point! Do we also get many shots from Hendrix from behind? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools run them all. The man in front of Hendrix seems to have his focus on stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the old back in the stalls looks at zero in the stalls, as well as documenting the incredible guitar work that the amps bloom (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). On track are tracks of student losers who protest against Vietnam, etc. on songs such as Machine Gun, completing the waste of movie! If Hendrix lived for another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the day as far as a complete official release goes. The one jewel it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a rather poor visual document of the great man and inferior to Woodstock and Isle of Wight
