Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose vast array of films including the all-out and repeat show (for example John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima") tried his hand at a great musical with "I Dream of Jeanie" . He played a lead of singers with little display of the movie and, as it turns out, virtually no future, he played a fictional and in no small part offensive story about great American songwriter Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is the young, love maker Foster, whose kindness is to slaves, including saving money for an engagement ring to pay the hospital costs for an injured little black boy. His intention is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) whose awkward younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), realizes she is in love with the almost impeccable songwriter. Foster is in love with Inez who is raised by the composer's number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune, O Susannah. Enter minstrel Edwin P. Christy (Ray Middleton) to start the profit phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> According to the musical film standards of the early Fifties, it is a great production. The sets are cute in the special Hollywood way that depicted mistakes with all the decorations. The singers are not half bad and the foster songs are almost impossible to destroy. <br /> <br /> But it's also a literal whitewash from the antebellum South. The biggest number has a black face for everyone on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism. If these depictions of blacks were nowhere near reality, the apostates would rightly be condemned to interfere with such a benevolent institution. <br /> <br /> "I dream of Jeanie" apparently sank in the studio's safe with barely a dead end. Now revived by Alpha Video for only $ 4.99. It is a period of beautiful songs and repulsive sentimentalism about the victims of America's great crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> That was what Hollywood two years before Brown v. Council of Education. Must have warmed the hearts of some filmmakers who carried their bedding to the theater.
