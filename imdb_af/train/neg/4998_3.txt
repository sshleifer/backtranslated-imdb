This one of the best celebrity realities shows ever seen. We can see the concerts we can see the life of Britney, I love the five episodes. I was always amazed by Britney and the topics of the show, I think some people are not watching the show, we can see how big a person she is. She is really funny really soft and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work. I just don't give a 10 because of k-fed he's a real push he doesn't look like Britney at all. I'm making a second season of this amazing show, as some people show how Britney really is. Britney is going to give you the best and you will never leave our hearts.
