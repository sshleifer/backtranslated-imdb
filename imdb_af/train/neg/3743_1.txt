Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other people in the world did not have animals to house, but Europeans did so, explaining why we could make steel and find out complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then in the third episode, he says that when the Europeans in South Africa got too far north, they ran Zulu people and other tribes that planted cattle and crops. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic performance if they had the most important things the writer's demands needed for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (to North America brought by black slaves) was our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 indigenous fighters and can beat 400 non-military South Africans 10,000 Zulus * without any single casualties * then I think you should conclude that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs we will succeed. <br /> <br /> He says Malaria stopped Europeans to colonize further north and kill thousands of Europeans while not touching Africans. (I want to know actual numbers, but he doesn't say.) Then he said today Malaria kills thousands of Afrikaners and therefore they can't come in with us. So what is it, Jared? Did Malaria help the Africans stop or hurt Eurpeans? And how has Europe done well despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the reasons Europeans have passed were dumb luck. At times when the evidence threatens to overpower his naughty theories, he is reluctant to admit that perhaps Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It is sad to look at this obvious neo-Marxist controversy to prove its point.
