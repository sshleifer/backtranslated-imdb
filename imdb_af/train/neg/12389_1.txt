Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is being tried, but completely free. He then rapes Kathy! <br /> <br /> Treatable and sick rape film. This movie has been advertised as an important rape drama. What it is is a poorly written and (mostly) bad play. It claims to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape, but moving the scene into our face. To be quite honest, however, Hemingway's play is so bad in the order that it loses any real impact it might have. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie just went too far when the 15-year-old Mariel was raped (fortunately it was not shown). I do admit that it led to a great end when Margaux grabbed a gun and shot Sarandon. But seriously - a raped young girl is just rebellious. <br /> <br /> Acting help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was definitely a beautiful woman (and a real model I believe), but her acting has left a lot to be desired. It reduces the film. Mariel was just OK, but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as the rapist. He was not bad, but the terrible writing worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember having risen some women at the show of this back in 1976 and cheered when Sarandon was murdered, maybe it works for some people. I found it boring, simplistic and VERY sick. A 1 all the way.
