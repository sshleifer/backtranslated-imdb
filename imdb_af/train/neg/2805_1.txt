This adaptation positively strikes a classic, loved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no understanding of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I get the feeling that he never read the book, but just sat on his too sturdy pants and handed a character summary that "Grumpy, broody, murky fits." Read. He does not play Rochester as a character or as a real person, but as a top man who never cries a smile after he gets engaged, which he miraculously morphs into. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation was excited about me was unbelievability and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who was definitely in her grave. Go and reread the book. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND AT THE WAY: A "Passion" Love SCENE doesn't mean you have to eat her face.
