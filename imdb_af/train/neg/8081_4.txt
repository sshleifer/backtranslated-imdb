One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it becomes satire, is that it's a little likely. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do much more harm than what it meant. But I will have left it to the physicists who saw Sunday crisis. <br /> <br /> This is a crisis facing the earth, because sunburn is completely out of control. They came close to Earth, so much so that it became relentlessly hot, as if the whole earth was the Death Valley. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that will have to take a spaceship to the sun and explode it there. It will deliver the torches in the direction of Mercury, which does not directly align it with Earth. <br /> <br /> Who should deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. This is if he can think of the business at hand and not the runaway son, Corin Nemec. Caring for the personal side of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather. <br /> <br /> There's also a villain, Peter Boyle, who is the chief executive of a multinational corporation trying to control the world's food supplies for survivors in this crisis. The idea that he cannot survive does not go into his mind. He does his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> Solar crisis looks like a bad mix of 2001, a Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle apparently from General Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he is the only one in the role he realizes is in a turkey and overrun it accordingly. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is stem-like, true blue and boring. Except probably the desert rat Jack Palance who finds and cares for Nemec. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the movie is directed by the floppy film surveyor, Allen Smithee, listed in Hollywood. The movie gets as many as four stars for that particular cast and it was timely for a Thanksgiving cut.
