I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi genre, but, given the actors involved, I thought I'd give it a go. The scene of the movie felt uncomfortable, through patches of each of the genres, but never quite balanced, so at last I stopped trying and focused on cinematography and individual performances, which I thought were good overall. , taking into account each character had little depth because of the nature of the story (nothing will give away here). I have to say it feels much longer than its 96 minutes, and not in a good way. In the end, I was looking for closure, some satisfaction, but it was not the clever or ingenious piece I had hoped for. I think Tony thought wrongly what he did at the end of the movie, we gave it ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to validate the previous 95 minutes with the bad conclusion. Eventually I feel cheated. IMO would have been better to leave it without the "end" as an art ... just. Or ... I may have missed the point completely :)
