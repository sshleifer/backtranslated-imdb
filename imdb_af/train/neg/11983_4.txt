Marie Dressler carries this depression-era drama about a friendly bank owner, who recently broadcast on TCM during their April Fools comedy month. If, with the expectation of great laughter, you come to the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, as it is really a very shrewd movie. It's also made very poor, surprising, as it comes from MGM. Leonard Smith's bald cinematography is strictly in the 'setup of the camera and does not move' school, often to the detriment of the cast, finding that they deliver lines from the screen (it is like a pan and scan before it existed!) or cut off with their heads. The film does not even have a credited director, which underlies the nocturnal nature of the production. Overall, this is an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler often over-emotional and just that bitter, final rule dash to the bathroom to dismantle it.
