What Hopkins does with this effort as author and director gives us a feeling that we know absolutely no one in the film. Maybe there is the problem. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were apparently complex and deeply drawn, but it is so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who someone is, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It could be about a scriptwriter interfering with his own characters. Is it? Can be. I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean there's no telling. Hopkins' film is an experiment. On the face of it, one can argue that it is about a screenwriter who, at the moment of his encounter with the lot, realizes that life is hit and miss and that success is a blind chance, as he is being swayed in "slipstream" of clashes between points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nonetheless, it is so cerebral that it does not allow for any hint of emotion, even to the small, fairly basic extent of allowing us a connection with its characters. <br /> <br /> I didn't think the nipple and flamboyant school of shaky, machine gun speed camera work and editing disconnected me, but I realized it was a lot to do with the movie. There have been so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movements have sound effects as well as other atmospheric deteriorating technical doodads. In this case, I suppose it was justified because its purpose was to put together the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams. But I almost didn't know anything about Slipstream when I looked at it, and I came out the same way. And I just don't care, because Hopkins made no effort to care for us. There are interactive movies, and there are movies that sit in a folding chair and break, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the latter.
