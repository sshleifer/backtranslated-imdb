American filmmakers have decided to make a movie that they think is Japanese. The characters are all badly represented, the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and does not represent Kyoto in the early 20th and 30th years. Whoever ever read the book understands that the authors have not added any extra value to distinguish the script from the script. Worse, they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall uses for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors who previously joined the tiger-hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and they represent Japanese culture. To see the two actors back together, even make the movies more ridiculous. Quentine Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 was made ten times more Japanese than that of this movie.
