Horrific and fickle wolf. The young "Red" wears full makeup, and very short shorts and cloak. Stayed about 20 minutes and realized it could be a pedophile's dream. The "up beat" music sounds like something I would hear at a strip club. Actually, I think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, glad I looked at my daughter, I don't want her to think it's normal for families to see kiddie porn together. Very bad, very sad it is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone would probably be ashamed of being in it. And what's with advertising it as a "special effects spectacular" ??? The effects are low budget, horrible.
