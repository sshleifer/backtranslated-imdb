I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview show and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. It is full of dick and fart jokes and is not proud of the action sequences (such as the shooting in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things I enjoyed in the movie. And many of which I didn't even agree with. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The jokes. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. The Dude was a vagina. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Make Bush again. We'll get it. He's an idiot. Move on. 8. The Dude has blonde hair. 9. The plot. 10. The death of minors 11. Your Boll was in it. 12. Most of the role players were just offenses and out there. <br /> <br /> Now the (little) stuff <br /> <br /> 1. The Dude uses a cat like a silencer as in the game. 2. Much action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo from the author of Postal) 4. Uhm .. I didn't have to pay it. 5. There are some "what the ef" moments <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He made another crappy game in movie adaptation. Kudos for you, Mr. Boll. 10/02
