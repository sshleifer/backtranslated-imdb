Primal Kind comes from B Film legend Roger Corman and as such everyone who sees it must realize that it is a Low Budget B movie and it knows it. <br /> <br /> A lot of terrorists with a truck dead and kill a whole army, they believe it likes uranium, but No ..... It contains two Dino's with a taste for Human Flesh ... Then a Crack team, also called Delta Force, can be called. . <br /> <br /> That's not Jurassic Park, and yes. The Dino's are never seen clearly, as it is obviously a man in a costume that is not too different from Barney the Dinosaur - just a little less scary, but come on. and do as it can. <br /> <br /> deserves to be in the bottom 100 ?. I think the almost half of the voters who give it a 1 are WAY WAY too hard, it is much closer to a 4 ... it is actually much better than a whole lot of other movies not in the bottom 100, and has a similar production value for a Sci-Fi channel production. (again Movies that get an overly tough time from critics here on IMDb) <br /> <br /> The acting is as expected in a B movie, though none of the actors take it so seriously, and the writing also not <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pleasant B Movie - Not for Movie Snobs <br /> <br /> ** from *****
