This movie contains Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a mail order bride from Russia, Nicole Kidman receives in the post and gets more than what he negotiated. When she's surprised, she's not what she seems to be. The story is pretty predictable and Chaplin undermines too much to the point where he gets a little annoying. Kidman is really pretty good at this role, and makes her character the only thing in this movie that is interesting. GRADE: C
