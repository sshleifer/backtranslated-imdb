My god, this movie is very boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie, I expected a romantic drama, and some good performances from Gershon. Gershon is big as always, but she is not the right actress for this role, she is too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance between Gershon and Serbedzija's characters is too convincing. And I absolutely hated Serbedzija's character (a wonman organizer), but he wasn't any charm in the movie anyway. How did Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) overtaken my understanding? Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford did a better job on this role, but they don't have the Europeans I think. Anyway, I was so bored to drink the movie. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, watch Bound, her best movie so far. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try a few Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is so underrated, and she deserves better chance than that, I wish her better choice in the future.
