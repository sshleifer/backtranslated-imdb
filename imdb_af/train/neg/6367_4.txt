This film has the look and feel of a Student film project. Yes, there are some interesting (though gimmicky) changes and shots, but the end result was youthful. <br /> <br /> The director didn't seem to have said "Watch this movie." It was as if he had said, "Look at ME! I am a DIRECTOR!" <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
