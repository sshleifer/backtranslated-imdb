I don't want to spur on The Pallbearer, it's not bad, but very slow at times. As the movie goes on, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but sometimes I don't care about her and she's good here. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you want the leaders, you can enjoy it.
