In a movie that follows a struggling actor, it seems clear that it is played by a struggling actor, but that doesn't mean Chris Klein. He struggles to bring something unforgettable to the role and store it through the level script that needs to be managed, which can only be described as a blind leading man. The story exists, but it is all, and failure to show any basic beginning, middle and end, and the viewer continues to feel his shoulders as if nothing in the last hour and three quarters really happened. <br /> <br /> A light light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stick out above his seemingly equally talented fellow stars and make a semi-decent work to make the back feel of Legde to bring life. Whether Fred can create it again when he works with a higher caliber of cast remains to be seen, but I will look out for him in the future.
