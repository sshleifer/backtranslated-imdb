Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 7 out of 10. This should be one of the worst movies I've seen for years. Not only was the play incredibly bad, the storyline (if you could call it) was just as bad. Offcourse knows everyone who will happen within the first 5 minutes. This is not a bad thing if you can enchant the audience during the action until that moment. However, this is not the case. There is no action, no tension, not even a spark between the two leading actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of my time, and definitely a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and the 2 just to try
