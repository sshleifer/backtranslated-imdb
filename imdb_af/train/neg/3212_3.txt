I'm a big fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell under my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda to feel ... slow, bad dialogue, lots of blood ... but it was worse than anything I could think of. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the cartoon, but the good points are almost silent. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that comes to my attention in the series. The movie covers only a small portion of the cartoon, and the section used is slower and more boring than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events rather than the more interesting overall plot of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been wonderful. Unfortunately it was not so, so now there is another terrible movie that will see little and even less love. My copy will have collected dust for years until I finally delete it.
