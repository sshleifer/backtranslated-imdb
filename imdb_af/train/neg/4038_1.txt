To put on how horrible The Shield is, you have to write pages and pages, that's enough to say it's a bad directing monument. <br /> <br /> "If directors go awry" should have been the title of this production. Indeed, directors are supposed to mix their work with a sense of visual style and storytelling that moves the story forward. <br /> <br /> How does the camera continuously kick and play a "style" with the zoom lens? How does it move the story forward? Of course there is also the "editing by random numbers" nonsense. Apparently, it is hip to just cut at random. <br /> <br /> I think it's too much work to do good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, it has done too much work for most people around The Skild who are discolored as one of the most overheated and unpopular performances of all time.
