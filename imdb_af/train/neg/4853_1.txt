I'm a big fan of war movies, and as a Vietnam veterinarian, I have some experience with the technical details. I worked with the bombs more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians and especially veterinarians in Iraq summed up the inaccuracies in this movie. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly about it. No bomb packing unit, or any unit, will have tolerated this fraudulent operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units praise consistency and discipline for a reason, it saves lives. The opening scene especially irritated me. The man with the phone would be shot immediately. Shouting, "Stop Link" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The screens with the sniper were particularly strange. As others have noticed, your average EOD guy does not know about a sniper, and to think of any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Abducting an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. Someone can shoot him, but these kinds of risks are limited to the movies. I can go on, but, as I said, others pointed this out in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it is awards, it is a further reflection on why "La La land" is so named.
