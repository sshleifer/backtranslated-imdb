When Ben (Red Foxx) discovered his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey), he went with his son Norman (Michael Warren) to leave his story of woe - just to discover that Norman has a secret lover: Benjamin Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Ben doesn't have to do it well, and there are many complications - including Ben's attempt to get Norman gay by fixing him with a hooker (Tammy Dobson). the movie looks much more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... IS IT YOU? was an absolute disaster at the New York stage. Thanks to the drama, I actually saw that it was performed as a community theater production in the 1970s - and while no one was accusing it of being anything but a shallow farce, the role played so broad and so that it was quite amusing. It is a pity that this film did not do the same. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible movie. Red Foxx, one of the hilarious comics of the 20th century, is about as funny here as yesterday's, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the television series HILL STREET BLUES, competed to a much better effect) with Foxx to see who's the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; The truth is being told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and a Wayland Flowers como have sparked - and unfortunately it is only compared to the rest of the role. <br /> <br /> Not only was the movie not performing badly, it looked bad. According to filmmakers, this was the first big screen effort to be made into video tape, which is then transmitted to celluloid for project purposes - and I believe it shows. The film features the appearance of a bad seventy season to the painted horizon seen through Norman and Garson's apartment windows. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad they get funny, but NORMAN ... IS YOU? is not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this movie in two words: miss it. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't touch it with a ten-footer. Just go back slowly and then run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
