Oh me, I think it's the only baldest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, it's one of the best b-movies. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, it's too mainstream for this. I put it on VHS, from a bowl full of videos at ex-rent at my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I can quote the blurb: "In the 17th century Japan has a samurai that is a standard for the centuries. His name was Mayeda. He is on an epic journey of the World ship to acquire 5000 mosquitoes from the king of Spain While a violent storm on the sea swallows their precious gold, they intend to buy the weapons and take their lives Mayeda must have the opportunity to survive and survive To make the fate of his beloved Japan safe. "It says," A multi-million dollar action adventure epic on three continents "<br /> <br /> I had to watch another movie. It wasn't an epic, and it certainly wasn't a multi-million dollar anything. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is actually just the crazy adventures of the English-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). He's not even a Shogun really, but it's not important. What is important is that he makes a very impressive impression of John Cleese's repeated upload of one castle in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and his ability to go through serious plays to portray his samurai intellectual powers. . Awesome. <br /> <br /> The biggest aspect of this movie is Sho Kosugi's Engrish accent. The movie may have almost everything that makes a good movie, but it does the best with all the best lines ever produced by the coolest Engrish accent. And honestly, do you really want something else? You can move forward 'Shogun Mayeda' forward and repeat Kosugi's finish line over and over. The band will probably go out before you get tired of that one line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very cheesy.
