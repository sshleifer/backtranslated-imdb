To put it simply, I don't love westerners. And I never sat down from start to finish, and decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the time, no matter how painful it was to me. Initially it was alarming as expected. I found the actors laughing, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing on the brink of pain. But after the first 20 minutes I started struggling to struggle to endure. Focusing on cinematography, and how John Ford succeeds in making even the dull situations (dull according to me) sometimes look impressive, made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can't go that far to say I enjoyed the movie at the end. But it was good enough for me to go to the end, and that in itself impressed me.
