BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; The man is absolutely rubbish and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Ulli Lommel movie, but I was so surprised at how everyone thinks his stuff is so terrible. Like the movies I said in the beginning, it's not even a six when it comes together! After reading the comment, I was curious to see how bad this man really is. He's the worst out there. <br /> <br /> The credits will not end as the pathetic movie starts and I quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly bad. The acting was incredibly horrible and the same on the camera shots. The editing is easily the worst. This movie didn't make sense and I couldn't bear it anymore because it wouldn't end and I was just 45 minutes in the movie. I couldn't take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT BE THIS CRAFT!
