Spirit of a murdered high school geek animation a scarecrow who then takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really irritated me. It has a wonderful monster, has some good low budget effects, an atmosphere, but manages the good stuff with bad short circuit. Halfway I quickly went ahead and then walked through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The trouble with this movie is a lot. First of the cast looks about thirty and yet it is supposed to be in high school. You believe nothing of the chance to go. The scarecrow, while it looks good, is not much further than that. He says dumb one linen and moves in a way more designed to be funny than frightening. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? This is a problem that goes beyond the one liners for much of the dialogue and setup. It seems to be more of every clich√© than a sad horror movie. I expect the film that the film is made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace. <br /> <br /> Despite the nice monster it's a movie to avoid. Even if you pick it up for less than five dollars, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
