I was hoping for some in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was a decent interview with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked to an overheated disaster that the sensational voice over in the worst tradition of TV production. <br /> <br /> If you can eliminate the voice over and change the program to a positive test of how people can overcome setbacks for a purpose out of the ordinary, it could have been good - but I feel that I wasted about 45 minutes of my life while watching a 60 minute program. I want those minutes back.
