As a writer, I find films that make this a bad production. Talk about insult. I wrote better stories than in the 8th grade. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction and when everything is added together, the result is complete and total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie manages to achieve is to trick the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time. Who would have written green light something so bad? It is not artistic, clever, clever, exciting, mysterious, scary, dramatic. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and sowing without development. The plot is recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to recruit some very well-known actors. Everyone should be pretty desperate for work or hope that one of these low budget independent movies will be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to guide a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman obviously has the power to kill men and women twice her size without a fight and in a single stroke . <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as it will infect you with an STD.
