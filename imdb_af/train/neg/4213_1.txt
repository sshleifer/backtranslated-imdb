Wow, I'm a great Henry VIII / Tudor era fan and, well, it was .... interesting. The only one I watched was the Qatar of Aragon. And wow ... don't. I've seen bad acting before, but it has reached new heights. When the actress Catherine played was umm ... crying? she cries and shouts and I have to admit I have returned many times ... many, many times ... funny, funny things. The only person who even showed a little talent was the actress Anne Boleyn played. I can be disadvantaged, but I have a little obsession with Anne Boleyn. She was a very fascinating woman reading on her, it's worth it! ) I also read a lot about the Tudor period and I think the characters were not very accurate, they were all very stereotypical. Just watch this movie if you are prepared to see a very important period, and the important lives of those involved have changed into a stockpile.
