Oh, bait. How do I hate you? Let me count the ways. 1. You are trying to be funny but are stubborn and unpleasant; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to move. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are incredible; the woman persuades to a terrible degree, and the "bad old" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as terrible as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try trying to intimidate Bill Gates with someone with a gun. It doesn't work, does it? An attorney, maybe, but not a gun.) Don't look after Jamie Foxx. Delivering a dramatic and sincere dialogue is ridiculous and allows me to throw. 3. You try to be action packs, but are too dull and drag too much. And when the action is heated, the tripod for the camera must be lost, because the screens wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself uncomfortable and again I want to move. 4. You are trying to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! I'd rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack of beef and no water, no sunscreen, and just Meryl Streep for the company. This hell will be nicer than a single minute that is spent spending more time in the bait, all over their way through a crazy story with Bill Gates for a bad man. Let's not even talk about the massive bomb running into a car that has Jamie Foxx's character. just drove a stone, but somehow managed to escape ... kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that I should never ever see a movie that is so bad.
