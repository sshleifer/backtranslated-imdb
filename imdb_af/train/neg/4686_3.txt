There were good performances by Robin Williams and others, but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> She thought she could become a serial killer who kills people: a lost man in ugly clothes walks his victims to koshowe, with Oprah and repeats his medical history until they desire to shoot them . <br /> <br /> I think the movie is mostly appealing to egotics who think strangers are interested in their photos. I expect most retailers want a break from the customers.
