This movie moves from 4th to 1st without hitting runners up to 3rd or 2nd, to the juicy, b-film finish. The concept at the beginning is easily the best and smartest part of the movie. It is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bath comes so fast, you may miss it. Definitely not the whole ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro for this bad to mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this so-called fringe society seem to be saints - especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
