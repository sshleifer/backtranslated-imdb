It was a pretty creepy movie; I found the music to be effective for this. The photographs taken by Mario from town were also unnecessary. However, I had three problems with this movie. One is that the lighting was very dark, so it was difficult to tell what was going on, but it could be my copy. The second is that the start is not well explained and I am not yet sure what is going on. The third problem is that I didn't understand the end, but it seems that some people do it. Of course, there are also the common problems of people who do dumb things, and the male head is 70's. All in all, viewable, but not even close to being a favorite.
