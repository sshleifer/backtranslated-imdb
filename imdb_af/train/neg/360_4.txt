I read the book and enjoy it from start to finish. But when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First, no lack of respect for Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a 24/25 woman. The late Christopher Reeve was also the same kind of reason. According to the book will be about 30. I'd like to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's journey to see him, as it was an important part of the characters' storyline development. Also me. Beasley was disgusted because the book mentioned her as a Plus Size lady. I know the movie didn't have the "Bridges of Madison County" budget, which I believe was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me it was a very poor, low budget, mystical movie. As someone mentioned, I wish you. Spenser retires and writes screens for her books as they should. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she'll consider doing it too. The movie dropped me!
