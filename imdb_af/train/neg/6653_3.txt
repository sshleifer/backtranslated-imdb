I just saw this movie, and I have to say it was a great waste of time. The girl Eva (Ellen Fjaestad played) cannot act at all. She reads her lines very naturally, and she had a very natural facial expression throughout the movie. Rosanna Munter who played Petra is of course a natural one. She played her part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before. She breaks, he finds another, she gets jealous, breaks up with the other girl and eventually ends up. There were no surprises at all, but one knew that Eve would break, and that Adam would "hook" with Petra. The only thing nobody saw was that Petra told Adam to go to Eve with Eve. She was all serious, which was a side of Petra who had not seen the viewers in the movie before, and told him to win back Eva's heart, which was really cute. <br /> <br /> Next to Rosanna Munter, there is no This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I don't recommend it!
