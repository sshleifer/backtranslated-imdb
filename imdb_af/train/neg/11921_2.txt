I can summarize this movie with 20 words or less. Too predictable of a story line with the potential to be funny, but instead flat on his face. Look, 19 words, but I not only tied this one movie with just one star, but decided to bump it into two stars because of the fact that Julie Bowen gave hot smoke and just gave enough eyebrows to let me rip DVD straight out of the machine and blow it up with a M80. My advice, take the $ 4.00 rent you would have paid to watch this movie and send it as an advance to me as an advance thank you for having the time and frustration to sit through this train wreck or you'll might want to send I have the $ 50.00 replacement fee you would have charged to take your twelve gags to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting.
