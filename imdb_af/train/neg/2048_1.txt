1 is quite generous here. I enjoyed BOOGEYMAN a lot, even though it is not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it! It crept me. But this movie, it's something else. To be directed by a man who has been around for a long time and directed a lot of movies, it looks like it was shot on a VHS video camera by a 10-year-old! The story and acting are horrible! David Hess, you dropped me too. Did you play one of the most threatening villains in film history? However, the story and acting could have been forgiven if someone took the time to make the video look a little professional. There are a lot of shots on video films out there that don't look that way, or at least not so obvious that it detracts from the movie. I can't say it's the worst movie ever, because I couldn't make it through the whole movie, but it's definitely close.
