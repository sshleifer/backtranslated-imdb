With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this movie to be at least acceptable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest with the remote control in my hand, so the quick prosperity was ready. So foolish, so standard, one knows what will happen in every scene. One can even predict the word-for-word dialogue. This is one of those movies that make a few head and say, "How did this movie ever make?" In an effort to say something positive, I add that there are some entertaining special effects. But if you've seen 5 Sci / fi movies, or if you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip it.
