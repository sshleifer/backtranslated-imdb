Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is probably one of the worst movies ever made. This killed Bruce Lee due to the fall of a helicopter after being hit by a kind of ninja knife at the back of the neck, but that doesn't explain how he got on a helicopter, as the previous scene but not on the helicopter that is already 200 feet in the air. It just gets absurd from then on, like something from a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea is not so rotten, but it is not done with some artworks from a movie point of view. There have been such martial arts bombers out there for decades, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam is improving the genre by adding credible stories to his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk films made in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. In my opinion, 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of junk cinema, despite Bruce Lee being in it.
