I saw the movie for the first time around twelve o'clock on a Saturday night. It's really the perfect time for this one. I have never seen a movie that was actually more predictable and saturated with stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, you shouldn't see it, because you can lose the will to live halfway through. However, if you want a good laugh, please check! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection, thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night. What struck me in particular is that every scene that would be expensive is copied from a Discovery documentary or an old TV special on the US Army. Furthermore, I was amazed at the fact that they did not make the slightest effort to make the production really look like. Afghanistan, as far as I can remember, is nowhere near any sea, but with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorist sand castle with his jet suit and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene, you can see the long hair of the Korean stuntman flap in the air as it is hit against the wall. Love it. I recommend seeing it with a few friends and a good amount of beer, but first you will understand why I'm mad to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
