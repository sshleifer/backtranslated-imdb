Having only seen it on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. Clearly, while the stooges appear stars, they do not really play the show. First, they were divided into two groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a few vagrants, so there's not much teamwork. The love story that burns the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability. There is another group of musical strokes that are unique, unless you are saddened by their efforts to be funny. The music is annoying, they drive cars to the farm and then depends on horses, the dorky western bear is stupid, and there is a terrible part of the movie without stooges on the camera. By the way, it's obviously after Curley's first stroke, and its reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appeared in an unknown role early on. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all the non-Curley stuff, but this little dog is pretty common.
