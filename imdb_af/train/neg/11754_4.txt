I have to admit that I am a big fan of this show, so you need to know how disappointed I was when I watched this movie. First of all, the plot was terrible, I thought it would be something more interesting, like seeing what happened to Arnold fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house between many other places, so many people try to stop it. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the plot was not so bad, but what was really sucked was the steps Arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for the sake of God), and to worse, they make super-moves on the bus, things many people have already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga not They are experts on a video game. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mother, my sister, was very disappointed after watching this movie because it was the worst way to complete a very good cartoon. I must admit I "Hey Arnold!" Enjoy, this was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but I'm not quite sure if I'm after this "Hey Arnold!" Don't look. as I watched it earlier. <br /> <br /> Another thing Nickelodeon, with the huge number of dynamites, can assure you is that no simple street would explode. I think the whole city can explode with it, oh, and please, if all your future movies are like good cartoons, don't do more movies, you give a bad critic to cartoons that were good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think it was the worst way to end this show, a good performance that's changed in this crap of the movie.
