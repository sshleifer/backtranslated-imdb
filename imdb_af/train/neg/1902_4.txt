WARNING: REVIEW INCLUDING SLIP SPOILERS <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe out there where Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, edgy, controversial independent film. Unfortunately, Gone ... is unfortunately in this dimension. Gone ... is a flashy, turbulent, testosterone-supplemented moronfest starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons not really worth going into, he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, of which only one has an alarm. This crew consists of the guy with the funny ears that are rumored to be the new Superman; a man who performed electricity in The X-Files; An old professional soccer player and two token black men. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are policemen, competing car weavers and Cracker's Bilborough, his Manchester accent is rightly knocked down and widened for American audiences now used to that kind of thing since Daphne in Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who gets no character; except to be a container for men's sexual desires. She and Cage are supposed to be old flames, which are odd as they never reach a normal conversation in all of the movie's 135m long run. <br /> <br /> In fact, characterization is so poor that when anyone has a "moment" a violin game in the background to emphasize the "emotion". It's not a spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous Paul Gasgoine "handball" maneuver and is pretty threatening) just gets one line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because his eloquent summary of the film's dubious morality after hitting the whole road is funny. Allegedly. After struggling with it in his "non-reasonably acting but-well-do" London draw, Cage quips "I always thought you were from Long Island". My ribs, as you would think, were good and tickled. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the most undeveloped aspect, from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters. It sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood being stuck; why is it that a black man cannot appear in a big movie without constantly being aware of his pitch tone and endlessly referring to it? The younger man who, like the elder, speaks for the whole duration, says, "Our black people do not like the cold, we are tropical people." He then goes out to give a joint smoke and watch Roots. Of course, he parodies the image of black people, but how funny is that? His older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself and therefore his color in third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" that. Does anyone know what black people are actually talking about? Don't think. <br /> <br /> The movie's soundtrack is played almost non-stop and with increasing volume, some of the tracks - especially Apollo 440's, "Don't Stop the Rock" - so loud it's actually more audible. as the sound effects and dialogue. The surround sound system even separates the two to such an extent that it sounds like two different movies that go together. No background music concept here, it's the odd equivalent to trying to watch a movie while someone behind the theater turned up their stereo. "Keep the music, young man!" <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie in the world and I really enjoyed it. It's just that it is predictable, lazy and whitish, with minimal effort in its construction. Apparently, the box office's expectations are considerable for this movie. After years of violence, it seems the general public is starting to wake up.
