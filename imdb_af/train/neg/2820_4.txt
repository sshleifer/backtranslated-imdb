I don't know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he shouldn't have bothered. As another commentary, there is not really enough horror or eroticism to bring in fans of any genre. The plot is incoherent, the Sade series are free and most of the acting is so-so. Englund did his best with poor material, and Zoe Trilling has a very good soil, but it is also not enough to carry this film. This one is a tape ear. Degree: F
