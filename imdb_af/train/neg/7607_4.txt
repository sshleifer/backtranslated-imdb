- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and is determined to clean the town. But not everyone in town is happy with what she does. When the sheriff orders a curfew in the town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a murderer to take care of the sheriff. The salon owner cannot know that the sheriff and the murderer will fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens if you have a pretty interesting concept and combine it with poor performance. There's a good movie here to get out of here. In more capable hands or with a bigger budget, Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a messy movie. <br /> <br /> - There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a non-active supportive, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and set like sets. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would start with the actors (and horses for that case), who of course are waiting for Corman to shout "Action". The best is the scene of two horse riders standing next to a building. Suddenly they took off and came around the corner, as they were hitting for a few miles. Or, take the example of people who seem to be able to transport themselves across town. We see a man entering a building and a second coming out of town to mount his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not as if Corman didn't have some decent actors to work with. While nobody was a big star, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all able to make a good show. But in Gunslinger they are not given much to work with. <br /> <br /> - I've seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would highly recommend doing the MST3K route.
