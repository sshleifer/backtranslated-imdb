Bangville police apparently marked the Keystone Cup debut, named for the studio they were working on. In this one, however, they do not attract the headphone costumes or drive the fast car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who begged her father for a calf. She later saw some strange men in the barn and called on the police quickly. One answer and the chase is on. Next, Mabel strikes her as someone enters. It seems that her mother is jumping to the conclusion that robbers are there! So while Mabel is blocking her door with furniture, the mother and father try to fight their way! It may have been the most amusing part of the brief with some police explosions. It was a short 7 minute run so fast before it started. The only true characterization that has been developed is Mabel's charm with just her face and big eyes and looks so optimistic about joy here, except of course when she's scared. It's easy to see why she has become a star. It is largely because of her that I have recommended seeing at least once and why do I give it a 4.
