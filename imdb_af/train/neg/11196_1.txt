My friends and I walked out after 15 minutes and we were not the first. Then we tried to get our money back. Corporate governance won't allow it, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time that worked for us was seeing Dickie Roberts, the former child star. As you can tell, it wasn't an unforgettable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. Now second, if I have seen a double scalp of Domestic Disorder and Heist. Finally, for the sake of mankind, please do not see the order.
