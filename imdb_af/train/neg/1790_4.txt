It was first a "cute" movie, then it became too juicy and had the best mediocre songs. <br /> <br /> There is too much King James English spoken, not only annoying in today's world, but not always. easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people today trying to listen to this movie? Forget about it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is like Hank Martin. Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also beautiful in appearance and beautiful, long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie with a nice ending, and I can't beat it. Perhaps it's a rental interest for historical reasons, or if you're a big Crosby fan, but it's not that much in general.
