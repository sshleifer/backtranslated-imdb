Revolt of the zombies is BAD. There is nothing entertaining about the movie. It was boring, lifeless, poorly acted and poorly written. I often complained that the original Dracula was a little slow for my taste. Well, this movie makes Dracula like a rollercoaster ride. The 65 minute time was 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control by "zombification". One man finds the secret and uses it to marry the woman he loves. Once that happens, he releases the zombies under his control from horrible consequences. That's it. This is the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie I tried to find out where I saw the male head. He looks so familiar. I had enough time to think about it. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombies rebelled" it hit me. This was Dean Jagger. I recently saw him as the general in white Christmas. That's how I entertain myself most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. King of Zombies, on the other hand, is a masterpiece of movie entertainment compared to this movie. For what it is worth, I give it a 2/10. (I won't go to 1/10, because it believes or not, I've seen worse.)
