The movie looks super on paper. A romantic comedy in which a love lover is towed in a smuggler should be generic crucifix gold, especially with this excellent romance cast. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that Lawrence Kasdan just gives his two stars too much and they have to hang properly and themselves. Adam Brooks's screenplay can be blamed, but you'd better expect the Kevin Kline from a fisherman called Wanda. Instead, the two ping-pong of each other and the unlikely emerging romance are never satisfactorily reconciled, because one of them is in France and bustles. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno is co-star almost like the cop-with-a-heart and I think he wished he was a star-with-a-part. He thought he did that Pink Panther remake (s). Maybe he was OK with this ... 3/10
