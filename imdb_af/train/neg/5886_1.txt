I would have left the movie halfway if I wasn't with people who like it. The movie is based on actual incidents, but it is so over it didn't really feel like it. I have a few psychological backgrounds, are related to many psychotherapists, and have gotten really crazy people, so it's not that I think people like this exist. But in the film were the only characters that were consistently human, Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing distraction - very sexy with a bad sense of fun). There were some entertaining moments, but the overall scene of the movie was grim, bizarre and nasty. What a waste of a great role play! As I watched them go through their turns, I just felt I was watching a stage class. It was brought home during the credits when a few people just showed up, didn't act, didn't speak. The few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
