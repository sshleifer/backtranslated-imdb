Eytan Fox, while usually leaning on the apologistic side of Israeli politics, has in the past made several interesting films, such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful movie, "Yossi & Jagger". However, in "The Bubble" he took this illogical and unfair approach to the limit. <br /> <br /> Far from the fact that this film is a standing ovation, people stopped and stood at the show. I also quietly left and flew with rage on such a ridiculous one-sided film translating self-preservation as racist bully, and racist bullying (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that Arabs are so outraged by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided Israeli aggression against them, and that they should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (indeed, I was considering claiming my money back), and was basically an Israeli monkey from the Palestinian movie "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, look at this movie anyway, as it justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a crying shame. Indeed, just how Israel might be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when Israelis themselves make propaganda of anti-Israel, beggars believe. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, horrible little movie!
