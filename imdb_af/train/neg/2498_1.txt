Forgive me for the obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course there are extremes within the two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Savings Private Ryan, and Star Wars Lock are comfortable in the good category. On the other side of the spectrum, there are those movies that simply aren't deserved to be named by name. Sometimes, however, someone produces a real turbulent movie. A movie to be singled out as a demonstration of how terrific a movie can be. A movie that's more than bad. Such a movie is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury ship being hijacked by a gang of malicious criminals who are calling for a ransom from an equally wicked ship's owner. Of course, there is a whole American hero on board, complete with jaw and sculptural chest made, which saves the day. <br /> <br /> It's a production that launches new depths. Everything about it is bad. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are incredibly poor. In short, this is an insult to the intelligence of any unlucky viewer. Even an American viewer will be irritated by his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to list things that make me angry about this movie. But his stupid-than-stupid conclusion serves as a sufficient example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine being an evil hijacker and standing in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You're in the company of the hero who owns a ticking bomb. The hero gave you the bomb and dived overboard. What will you do? I don't know about you, but I will throw the bomb into the sea as far as possible. Not this man. He watched our hero swing away and then he tried to disarm the bomb with unhappy (for him) results. Enough said. Such an interruption would earn a mention in the Darwin Award and could also be an appropriate end to the production team's lives.
