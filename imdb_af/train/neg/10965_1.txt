I actually look at this movie while writing it. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true, artistic filmmaker", then it is. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (still think as I am currently) that this movie. . . To put it mildly, much, much overestimated. Again, many. <br /> <br /> It looks like a really bad student trick done by a person, with the utmost special resources. . . and who hasn't given much attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I don't want to continue with all the different ways I miss this movie, but. . . well. . . I just don't get it (rememeber, I fully admit that maybe it's ME, it's the idiot here - not the movie maker - not to get this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rented it on a grill because the reviews were very, very outstanding. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
