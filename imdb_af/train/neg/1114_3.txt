In this day and age of incredibly special movie effects, this one was a sore disappointment. The actors were stiff and uninspired, just like the dialogue. Westerners are not common to Hollywood so much, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone still knows how to make a good one. Considering that it is difficult to understand that anyone would go into the release at all, and less less such a poor movie than this one creates. If you love and look for a good western, keep looking!
