I'm a big Willem Dafoe fan, and really wanted this movie (I had to get a region of 5 Chinese DVDs!). But it's really one of the worst things I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> The play (except for Dafoe) is terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande both wrote and directed it (although he was not credited as director), and they have NO noticeable talents for writing or directing. (Join acting William; Giada comes out of business, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Apart from a series totally unconvincing, completely without credible motivation, these two people (who just meet) enter into this home. Colagrande is drowsy, I can't give less expression, and hardly ever changes. And the sex scenes are straight lame. I actually went to one of them twice. Bah! They are certainly not the least bit erotic, and yet the only time the movie doesn't let you sleep. Then it's holding you back. <br /> <br /> Just awful.
