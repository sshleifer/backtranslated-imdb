One of Scorsese's worst. An average groove; The only thing to recommend is De Niro playing the psycho. The final is typical of this genre, that is, over, with another almost invincible, immune-to-pain villain. I didn't like the 60's original, and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on remake. Then again, considering how bad his recent movies were (I refer to his dull Buddhist movie and everyone with his new favorite actress, the blonde girl Di Caprio), is not even bad. And since Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... could have been much worse.
