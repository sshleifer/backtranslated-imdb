This movie has a. score and a bad performance by David Muir as dr. Hackenstein. The start and end credits show up with most of the actors and the "special effects" that it is a low budget film. There's nothing in this movie you can't find in other crazy scientists, horror / comedy, or low budget movies. Not special for naked scene buffs or bad movie lovers. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about either. If you are curious as I was and can actually find it, you will realize the truth of one line summary.
