In one word: unfair. I was advised to read a few articles on the philosophical meaning of this movie, but after putting the movie's uninterrupted 115 minutes and being slowly intermittent among its bloated symbolism and lava-flowing oppression, it was better to just me. report reactions to the movie. After all, who's going to see a movie with a syllabus in hand? And this movie was gloomy. Leader actor Claude Laydu, from the opening of the film to the end, carries the same tiring and annoying mask of fear, which is virtually indistinguishable from the film's eternal, brave voice-over. Filming one over the other could have worked better than submitting an audience for both, since they basically say the same: The priest of Ambricourt is a miserable person. The story of a persecuted priest trying to help a troubled rich family does nothing to make his characters distant or sympathetic, as the family is a lot of unpleasant weirdos. The priest himself comes across as a nasal plague. The last 30 minutes indicate a bit of breathtaking message about grace and one man's suffering, which is similar to the other, but because of all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson's writing. It's over, let's have some ice cream. Interesting to fans of Bresson fanatic Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of character and institution included Schrader in his own scripts and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
