I had absolutely nothing to do over the past weekend and watched a movie with my friends ... any movie. And since the only movie we didn't see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to go for it. <br /> <br /> GREAT MISTAKE. This is a movie that can only appeal to children. Oh, and it's not like I don't enjoy movies aimed at the younger audience. But this movie has absolutely nothing to keep my attention. If you have nothing at home, go to bed. It's better than wasting hard-earned cash out of it. Watch the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
