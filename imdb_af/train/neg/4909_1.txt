That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books, and I read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the author should be shot. <br /> <br /> What right has any filmmaker made a fantastic work of fiction and made it into a mockery of the mystery genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter was slaughtered, Michael O'Hara proved wrong to me. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter approaching this fantastic book will do much more justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Don't stop your day work.
