I regret every second of the time I lost while watching this movie really. Unfortunately I always find it difficult to turn off a movie as soon as I start watching it. Especially when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think this is one of those movies that every film lover had to watch at least once. That's why I watched it. Don't get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, as well as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a great scam. No really good plot, not even a spy or a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mix of both of these genres. The only thing that caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would eventually be together or part of each other. I think "To have and to have" is much overestimated and Bogart was in much better movies during the 1940s.
