This short spoof can be found on the Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of "Night of the Living Dead". Good thing as I never would have even gone a little out of my way to see it. Recycling zombies with bread sounds just like a foolish innocent fun on paper. In performance, this is another matter. These short did not even evoke a visit from me. I never really thought I would say it, but "Night of the Day of the Bride's Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror Terror Attack, Mutant, Alien, Meat, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D "was a much better parody and not nearly as lame or boring. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
