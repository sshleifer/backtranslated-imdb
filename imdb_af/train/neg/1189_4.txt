The show's echoed 'bubbling' sound effect used me to sleep. A very soothing display. I think I could have slept through the parts where there was danger or danger. I also heard that a few boots shot for a show on sponge divers in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I will assume that Lloyd Bridges never duds there. I just remember the performance in reruns and although it was never exciting, we would make our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house. We imagine the bubbling sounds, and tell us adventures in our heads. . I thought 'Flipper' had better submarine action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
