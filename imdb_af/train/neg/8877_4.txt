'Major Payne' is a film about a chief who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This movie doesn't have much to offer, but it offers several hilarious moments worth a watch. Don't expect it to be a memorable movie. Just expect to be laughing at the movie and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy was hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the movie, except for the boys who want revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a good movie, and it's probably best viewed on a rainy day when you need a little laugh.
