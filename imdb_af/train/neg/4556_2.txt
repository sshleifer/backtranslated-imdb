I don't know what that other man thinks. The fact that this film was made independent does not make it any less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you like ... the majority of this movie is a thought. I feel I'm insulted by watching the first 40 minutes. And it alone wasn't a little thing. Not only is the play terrible, but the plot is never even developed. There are many holes in the story, to the point where you can no longer call it a story. I've never read the book, so I can't criticize it, but it's the first review I've written here and it's the intention to save all your viewers out there one hour and a half of your life . I can't remember the last time I couldn't even watch a movie. This one really takes the cake.
