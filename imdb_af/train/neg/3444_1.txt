It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, though the shots, the "special effects", the acting, and I called the plot? Every thing in it sucked ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "over-doing" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this movie has tried to do; It was supposed to be one of those movies, you can't really tell what the hell is going on. You sit mysteriously, don't know who is dead and who is alive and who has who and why killed and just when you think you have the timeline right, find out you're wrong and end the movie - with an open mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "Work" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the author of this litter, yes, Olga ?? The author, director, producer, writer, writer, production designer, art director, costume designer and also a double for one of the characters, are a few scenes ... it's basically a one-woman movie and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions", you can't go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, it can come as a shocker, but "this time" Olga did this big time, from scene to scene, from dreams to reality ... But wait! it was a dream ... or was it ?? The picture faded and I realized that nothing of it ever happened. The girl was alone on the ship. Actually, there was no ship. No wait! There is the ship again, and the guys! They live! Thank God! No, they call her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, maybe they are immediately dead? or maybe they have never lived to begin with? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I just said, you can keep this movie - otherwise it is a tedious piece of work and the only reason I went through this whole crap is to find out how hell they can complete this movie ... <br /> <br /> Don't watch it if you appreciate time, 90 minutes is a waste in this case ...
