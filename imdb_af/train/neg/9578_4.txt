Can A-Pix ever do anything right? This movie was meant to be seen on TV in a letterbox format. As A-Pix does not even believe in pan and scan, we see whole numbers where a shoulder on the left side of the screen on the right is talking to a shoulder. Of course, not that you miss much. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie where characters shout during the 80% of the movie on top of their lungs.
