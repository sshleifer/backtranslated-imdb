Wow ... where to start ... picked it up at Big Lot for only $ 2.99. It's three dollars, I'll never see again ... ever ... and for what? I'll tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes boring, boring, boring chats and colleagues more suited to a lifetime movie than the horror movie advertised on the box. (May the marketing dryers it designed for everlasting fire). Follow it with a bit of cheap gore (not even a good thing ...) and a plot at the end that comes out of nowhere and doesn't make sense. Awful, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> Were there any redeeming features? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there were six breasts involved, but it's hardly worth my three lost three bucks. Without it, it could be on Sci-Fi, for example, two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
