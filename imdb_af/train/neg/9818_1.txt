This movie raises a number of urgent questions in my mind. First, how did Jennifer Tilly manage to maintain a film-showing career over the years, based on the ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited variety of hammy facial expressions she employed? Secondly ... on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film? And thirdly ... since there were enough people to decide to make such drinks, no one would have been in the system - the studio, the distributors or somewhere - just enough to prevent it from actually completing and releasing it become. You really have to look for a long time to make another movie as big as this ... and it is not even billed as a horror movie - as far as it can be considered any legal movie genre, it is definitely. The film runs from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features. I really don't commit censorship (of which I don't believe) ... but I really can't see how anyone can sign positively to watch such a movie.
