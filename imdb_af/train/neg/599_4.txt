Well, I have to say this before revealing the "monster." say he doesn't really fit in that category, just a little weird thing that had an annoying scream! And personally I think a grandmother could have run away from that thing, but anyway. I actually came in this movie, although the main character came to be a drunk and a heroine addict as an appeal. But such scenes as when she is away from the train, and you can see the figure at the door are a bit funny, even where the guard was just killed and the "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster is stuck as if the monster was unveiled, it just became your average horror, with limited excitement or fright. Slowly, I get bored, and wanted to turn it off. I like most people saying the homeless have root to make it, especially the old one, he laughed at me here and there. I think this movie could have been something special, but it has become what every other horror is nowadays! Just boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a sensible gorefe (limited, hardly any), anyway give it a go, but for all your serious horror viewers look elsewhere, much better movies out there.
