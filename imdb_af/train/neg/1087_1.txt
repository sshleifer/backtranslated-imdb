It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While having good actors, the film doesn't live up to expectations. The most dramatic aspect of this movie is the music, which summarizes the movie pretty much: compensation for a bad and confusing story by having famous players, hard and dramatic music. It doesn't change the fact that it's a very boring movie to watch. Earn a score of 1 yourself.
