When we were in high school, some of our boys sometimes repelled stink trees. It was then considered funny. But the producers, directors and film of Semana Santa ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they still put it. <br /> <br /> Like the previous reviewer wondering if the role player was anxious to get off the set and at home, I doubt that more than one task was done for any of the screens. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, warm in "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top rated movies, apparently underlined this project. Her acting has not existed, but is mostly confined to capricious stare which is supposed to indicate how "sensitive" she is to the plight of the film's various victims. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - don't be the next victim! Get away from the DVD if you get it on the shelf. Tbere are not very good shots of Mira (the only high points I can get in the film) and the supporting role is of inferior quality. It makes a bad dialogue with the embarrassment of 'Spanish' accents that are the best high school worthy. theater production.
