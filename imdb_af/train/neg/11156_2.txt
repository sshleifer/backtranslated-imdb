Dark Wolf (Quick Overview) Let's get it right: It is a repulsive piece of rotting road kite with a cow. It's just a horrible movie. It is an urban werewolf scene with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story so bad as a gang of nerds from an 80-year-old drama movie. What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was played in the giant werewolf. Can fk cking Hodder. Someone trying to make Jason Voorhees play is the highlight of his film career. <br /> <br /> Anyway, former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and eventually becomes a werewolf. It's kind of a scratched copdrama with the world's worst reflective wolf. But it does have moments of near-disastrous nudity. But it's about everyone. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is generally an ugly, blue black fade around the screen. And if we're privileged to actually see a transformation drive, we're presented with something that looks like a full-motion video of a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The CG animation is really so primitive. Just good for horror hardcore fanatics who want to see little moments of nudity surrounded by turbulent visual vomit. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
