How this movie was made with so many stars is beyond me. This is a horrible clich√© 'ridden movie with the worst that any of these actors ever did. It really surprises me so much of this list stars will agree with this unfunny movie. What's worse is almost 100 million here in the states. However, it's about showing that big stars can pull in the dollar, even if the movie is terrible. I was sorry for everyone involved in this snorkeling festival. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he was given and the rest of the stars walked through the moves. Whatever you do, do not fall for the excellent throw, because no one could have saved it.
