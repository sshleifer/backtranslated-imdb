This film was one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is a combination of police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shooting at a hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is confronted and there are too many side issues going on. Ford is selling property (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett manages a yoga school where he gets chicks in his spare time, the two are investigated by internal affairs. Ford screws the ex-girlfriend (Lena Olin) from the IA investigator and she is a psychologist who has a radio program. The man who died at the club is a dirty ex-cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> Toss in the compulsory car hunters and a little bit of humor, and it's about the core of this turkey.
