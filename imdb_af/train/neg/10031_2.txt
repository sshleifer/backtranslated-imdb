I just saw the movie in the theater. The movie has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and some songs may be. That's it. The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even in Mumbai Indians (just now Chennai made it to semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Now Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors have a lot of effect to make it look real. But unfortunately Bollywood directors don't have that much time. They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie. Now, such stupid action scenes in South Africa can work if the audience just pays to watch their favorite actor killing a lot of people. But in Bollywood it certainly won't work. All the action scenes I wish I could have sent. By the end, even a few Chinese people appear to be beating Akshay Kumar anywhere. This is the height of stupidity. Public does not pay such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget the action movies. They can't make it. The last good thing I saw was "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie lovers like me. Do these people see their movie after completion? Can't find out that the slow motion action (done with ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not to have action scenes if you can't handle them. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where film like Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the current era screens. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of Hollywood movie directors. Please do not make action flicks until you have acquired the art to make it realistic.
