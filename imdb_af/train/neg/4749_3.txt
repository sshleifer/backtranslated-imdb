This movie was so poorly written and directed that I slept through the film for 30 minutes. The jokes in the movie are lean and although the plot is somehow interesting, it is too far-fetched and on some points ridiculous. If you are 11 or older, you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger, it will be a movie that will take your attention and be surprised with all the stunts (what I might add, is poorly done) And wish you were a few fighter. The decisive role in this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like trying to build up the tension, but it didn't fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 is excellent, 1 is terrible), the play in this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious plays, her was play is ridiculous. When she made her "fight", I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely directing the part where her enemy seems to be the evil villain, how her voice gets dark and angry, I think it was incredibly stupid and how Wendy's (Brenda Song) teachers were all her teachers at school owned by monks, it was pretty ridiculous. So to sum it all up, a disappointing movie, but good if you're 10 or less.
