The 1963 version of "The Haunting" was one of my favorite horror movies for many years, so I was expecting the delivery of these 1999 remakes with a lot of tension. It seems rare that any succession exceeds or even equalizes the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my concerns were well founded: This movie stinks. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the people involved in this movie thought. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have led the excellent "Speed", did so poorly (or even worse) than he did with the promising Duds Twister and Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. "Hey Jan, stick to cinematography, do you want? Liam Neeson is adept in his role as the doctor-pretend-to-sleep-psychologist - I don't think he's able to turn into a really bad performance not - but even he cannot script and save a lame ... poor story Catherine Zeta Jones proves again (as she did in "Entrapment") that she does not have the acting ability to rise above the material handed to her The female head, who performed well in an episode of "The X-Files", looks like Eleanor, an insomnia that moves on the brink of common sense, and that blond man, whoever he is , is more wood than the strangely strange figurines of children cut into the woodwork around the house. I don't think he changes expression once during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AED) <br / > <br /> The reason why the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the House was really chased or the manifestations were a result of An Eleanor's unforeseen mental state. No spirits are actually seen in the original, and very far from the imagination - a feature of other great horror films such as "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project." Of course, in this updated version, we get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically (in light of the poor writing / plot) make the movie totally rude. The f / x is not even that big, as it was done by ILM. The frozen breath seems especially fake. The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson movie, The Frighteners, which I saw just before this one, were much better. The carving of the kids, which is supposed to look spectacular, just looks stupid (especially when they are screaming), and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Instead of relieving the bad-acting, bad direction and bad writing, the effects only add to this junk of a movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly dumb scenes: When the other three characters break into Eleanor's bedroom, none of them seem surprised to find a giant devil's devil floating over the bed. The scene where Eleanor "sees" the former lady of the house hanging from the branches ... the acting here is especially bad. And last but not least, the unintentional hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy jumps out of an uninspired, supposed to be anxious, on a piece of furniture and on the painting of the old, evil man who built the house. We actually get some satisfaction in this scene. Blonde Guy is dragged by the old man's ghost over the fireplace as a second after his attack, and quickly cut off his head. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, stick to the original 1963 "The Haunting." 3/10 stars.
