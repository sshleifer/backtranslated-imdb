This movie is bad. I mean not only bad as in; "Oh, the writing was bad," or; "The acting in that scene was bad." I mean bad, because in someone, criminal charges must be held to feed this unmanned hope into rubbish on an unsuspecting public. I won't even make it worthy of an explanation of the (Plot ??) if I can call it that. I can only watch another movie once in a few 40-year-olds, and see if I need to vent my spleen on a movie. I mean, no one is going to deliberately make a bad movie, do they? Well yes. Apparently they do ... and the guilty man is writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst part is that Blockbusters actually rent it to their clients! Be advised. Leave this crap where it belongs. Stuck to the shelf, collect dust.
