First, it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know Hackman is doing a bit of work for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these rows. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story doesn't go anywhere, and just shows us that Hackman is under the eye and everything he says or does is known by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. All these things had to take a maximum of 10-15 minutes, just as a set-up for the real action, plot and plot. By the time the right action goes, I'm so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is good as usual, and also the other actors, but it is a dud of the first size.
