This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an undeniable error in his storytelling. While handling the Ralphie situation, Christopher states that he heard about Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context it is very clear that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who killed Ralphie. However, there is no way Chris could have heard of the accident. Who had to tell him and when? By the time he was torn by Tony's call from his delirium, no one was informed otherwise. Tony knows this - which makes it even worse! Hearing Christopher talking about Pie-O-My's death, Tony can only conclude that Chris himself put the fire on. Given the impressive extensive writing process as told by the authors themselves on the DVD, I really wonder that none of them realized the problem there. The story just doesn't work. Needless to add, I'm a big fan of Sopranos. Otherwise, I would definitely not mind.
