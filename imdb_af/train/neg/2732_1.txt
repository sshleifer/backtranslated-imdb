When "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" was broadcast last season, I was happy. Scrubs, I think, do something smart and unique about the clip-show concept. Instead of playing again, they play jokes in a self-confident way, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I unfortunately found it wrong. One season later, they conceded what almost all sitcoms were inevitably doing, the exhibition program ... and it looked like it was made up of the work experience child. Dr Cox's crafted headline shows just how lazy the editors were to put it together, as it didn't appear until 'My Long Goodbye' another 4 episodes later. I cannot imagine that a wig is too much trouble when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. Who knows why it was dragged there was just lazy and out of place, and reminds me (largely) of episodes that have been downloaded over the past year. <br /> <br /> Three second tracks held with background music are a DVD extra for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime television.
