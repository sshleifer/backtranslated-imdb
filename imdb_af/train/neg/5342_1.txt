Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all on top. They earn Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm also a big fan of the TV show. Their music rocks and they are all so talented! I'm also a big exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU HAVE A S CLUB, DO NOT READ !! <br /> <br /> The performances are terribly poor, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes aren't even properly performed (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that eight small, passionate S Club fans didn't laugh. They thought they could do it better. And they did it. They conquered the world. They have become S Club Juniors. Paul, the thick, ugly one who started a mosh band, must thank his happy stars he left when he did this. One of the worst movies ever made. Be aware of this movie! Don't go and see it! YOU WILL NOT LOW! YOU WILL GET! 0/10 RJT
