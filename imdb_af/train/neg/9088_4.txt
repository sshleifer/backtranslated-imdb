It has been said several times - not least - that looking at an Eric Rohmer movie looks like it looks dry; It looks like Mr. Rohmer denies it (he does not deny it, but how can he just disrupt it) so that his new movie, which may also be his last, is so far back in Allah that it looks dry. The wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have named it one of the best films of 2007, so you have to give it an idea. The reality is not high on Rohmer's agenda, so we in the 5th century France on one side have a cape that would not be in the Loire Valley. The only other home we see is an impeccable log cabin. The story involves nymphs and shepherds. As he often revealed to Rohmer with strangers who just remained, so the overall effect is that the annual class performance at a school for special needs learners is accidentally captured on movies. One is almost requested to say, "Come back, Godard, everything is forgiven", but even this turbulent production cannot let me speak the words.
