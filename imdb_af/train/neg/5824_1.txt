I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there is this one song at the end that just yells "Yaowwww!" while someone randomly knocks on a wooden object. It is said that there are some beautiful songs, but it is not worth watching the movie. Go to iTunes (they have the album), preview it, and choose the good one. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy who makes tea. Well, that's a slight exaggeration. But you will see what I mean when you see it. This is said: DO NOT SEE!
