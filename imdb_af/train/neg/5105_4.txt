I think there are a few out there that Nicole Eggert from her early days to such TV shows as T.J. remember. Hooker, Charles in Charge, and who's the boss? You distort yourself! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and had breast implants. No matter, you will definitely forget her in this alleged comedy about people eating aliens. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that don't make sense and are never explained. How does she recognize the stranger? Why was the stranger hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why didn't the stranger eat her? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the stranger eats her boyfriend and accepts his identity, you get her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to see this waste. Stay for the shower scene and boyfriend, and go over your business.
