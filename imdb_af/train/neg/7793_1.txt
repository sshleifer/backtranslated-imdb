It's really one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a big zombie movie fan and usually endure bad acting, a special effect, a dumb story and everything you can experience in two-tempo movies, as long as the movie has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or whatever even offers. This one basically has no positive aspect and is third or fourth rate, maybe worse. Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week's holiday and definitely did a better job (no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This movie is not even funny, and nothing else. Really bad and excess special effects, like ordinary people's zombies (except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces), GO TO MANY FAKE BLOOD (I like realism, the combination of realism and zombie movies is debatable, but the offered ones are simply stupid. The camera stays fairly long with food zone, it gets boring and you can't help but wonder why the zombies use weapons (!) To kill their prey. I won't go into the details of the dubbing (others did it). Although I myself am from Germany and at least a little curious about the original version, I will no longer waste my time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Keep away from it, as far as possible.
