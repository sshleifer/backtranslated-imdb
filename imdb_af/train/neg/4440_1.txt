Let me be clear. I used IMDb for years. But just today I made the effort to register on the site, just as I could give the movie the lowest possible rating. I saw hundreds of movies, some of them bad, some awful. Never before have I seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, with high intentions and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino has been dumped as a princess, but totally unbelievable as a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the movie is much worse, even than the indifferent French play source. (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood so far, and we should keep it that way). <Br /> <br /> To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is widely spread with cup-to-cup chemicals and names of well-known scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is even more played. For this, the couple must receive a joint Clair Danes award, awarded in a fair world for a free anachronistic and uninspired reinterpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> Apart from the horrific plot and dialogue, there are efforts to introduce artistic tropics into filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are fading in and out of action, sitting in chairs and watching the main characters. The director wants us to realize she has been adapted to a play. I understand. But it doesn't happen far into the movie at all. At that time, there were a crowd of people sitting in the chairs for a moment, then disappearing, creepy and distracting. They are like a frightening zombie crowd, appearing through the villages and fearing. If you see the horrible song and song ending this movie, you will want to raise your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the serious injustice to poison your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Mathew McGuire
