In spite of being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90-style style that was "old" and obsolete a few years ago. The cheese-like cuts and effects were painful to watch. The writing is decent enough, and a few scenes have made me so angry (such as when taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective whose sister killed her and how he had suicide was just awful. The performance by the actor playing Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. However, I've been through the whole thing, which is scarce for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just get on TV and decide to watch.
