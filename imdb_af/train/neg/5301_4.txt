I bought this movie because it was Shah Rukh Khhans Debut. And I also liked to see how he would do it. I must say he is excellent in his role. Divya Bharathi is wonderful in this movie. Rishi does a wonderful job. Shusham Seth supports well.Alok nath was good in his role. Amrish and Mohnish also did their parts well. It was also good in its small role. Actors shine in a mediocre movie. The direction is average. The editing is poor. The story is boring. This tells us about Ravi a well-known pop singer. He has many female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaajal views a widow. To escape from Ravi's cousins. They're going to Bombay. She's about Raja. She falls in love with him and gets married. Ravi return. The story is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half is drilled. It also attracts a lot. But it was saved by the actors and music. The second half entertained. The music is catchy with some nice songs. The cinematography looks obsolete in t he is the first half, but it seems unthinkable. The song illustrations are boring except for Sochenge Tumhe Pyar and a rain song. These costumes are outdated. Just look at the actors and music. Rating-4/10
