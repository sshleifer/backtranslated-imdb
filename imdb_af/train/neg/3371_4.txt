Incredibly unlikely and foolish pot boiler that has at least some redeeming, sharp location photography, but it's too incredible to generate a lot of tension. I had a good hope that Stanwyck wouldn't bring it back in time, because she was really wet, in more ways than one man, and she also had an idiot child. Why not walk away with Meeker? But the diminishing demand remains. What kind of wood was it that made the support of the pier when a rotten piece pulled it off? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best she can with the material, but it's thin.
