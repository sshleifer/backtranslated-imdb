The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a camping charm: it opens with crawling text from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson calls his short-term victims in "Pulp Fiction") continues with two karates school teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of man (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appeared himself; He immediately stopped a plane that hijacked and broke a bottle in half with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, deliberately or unconsciously, is bruised by the untouched story, the lack of action for long periods and the poor quality of any present action. To keep it simple, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are hardly any battles. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles there are are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is glorious. It's just for those I give the "Bodyguard" a 2nd star out of 10. This movie is 87 minutes like 5 hours.
