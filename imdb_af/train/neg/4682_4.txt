Yep, yelling, screaming, cheering, arguing, four, fist sounding, high fiving and fighting. You have a general idea of ​​why, but can never be 100% sure. A fleet of knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points, but then you will probably see many errors. Not a horrible movie, and Hackman & Washington are their usual brilliant, but the plot was one that you could get up early. I'm still waiting to see a submarine movie where people come in and argue with each other, but then you probably won't have a movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
