What is it? A Canadian has made a zombie movie that I've never heard before. A doctor is working on the body of a young man who recently died. It allows for an extensive review that shows how the man came there. Basically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised the dead, thanks to his folly. Cut back to the mortuary where our dead body returns to life and kill the mortar and owner (which causes his eyes to protrude). The final WTF? Shot has the funeral homeowner in a straight jacket and shouts: "I'm not crazy!" Incredibly he returned his eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Running a barely 58 minutes, it's definitely one strange thing in the zombie theater. It feels much longer, but puts me in a kind of trance where I couldn't stop watching. The movie also has one of the "if you see this picture, turn away from the screen" gags. This is the image of an old man who becomes ill in a theater (prophetically?) And when he comes up (only twice), the blood begins to flow. The screens are pretty damned for the time being. There is a big gaffe where a zombie cuts the right hand of a girl with a kick, but - if he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp it, it's a left hand.
