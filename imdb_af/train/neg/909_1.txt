Don't ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a movie. The way it shot, relieved, acted, etc. Don't make sense. It's so bad, it's hard to watch. many cuts are repeated repeatedly. There doesn't seem to be a 'normal' person in the whole movie and the existence of the 'outside world' is, it just doesn't exist. And why does that bare guy suddenly become invincible? This movie is beyond stupidity. zero.
