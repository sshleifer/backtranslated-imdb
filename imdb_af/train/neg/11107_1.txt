It was a terrible movie. There was no story line whatsoever. To take it all off, when they couldn't explain the blood (the only good part) ... they threw some strangers! I hate when directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the strangers! Watch this movie if you want. But don't say I didn't warn you. Two things: How can Vinny say "welcome" when he didn't have a tongue? It's a pity. Mr. Jones didn't have a bigger role. The second thing that bowed me, why did we show Vinny Jones cooking and he cut it off and put it in blue liquid, then this had no further role. Why not? I don't like to show anything and it has nothing to do with the story line at all. In short. Bad story. I won't waste my time - wish I'd rather watch Mirrors.
