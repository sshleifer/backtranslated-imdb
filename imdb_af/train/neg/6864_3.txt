There is a bit of a spoiler below, which can ruin the surprise of the ONE unexpected and truly funny scene in this movie. There is also information on the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on DVD, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate. It comes as a set with the first film in the Blind Dead series. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely much worse than the first, "La Noche del Terror Ciego". In addition, many of the features of the first film have changed significantly. To start, the movie is printed in English (the first is subtitling), which I tend to find distracting. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in frivolous and secret rituals. At the discovery of these crimes, local farmers killed the Templars in such a way that their eyes could no longer be used so that they did not return from hell to judge their revenge. We then leap into modern times, where the Templars rose from the dead to carry out their revenge on the villagers whose ancestors had wasted them in the first place. Of course, since the undead have no eyes, they can only find their victims if they make a kind of noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a mysterious order, from about the 12th century, dating from the Crusades. They were only about 150 years before they were suppressed by the pope and others in the early 1300s. Because they were secret, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially for initiation. Also, because of the way in which society is organized, you did not necessarily have ecclesiastical officials who oversaw things, which meant they did not have an inner man when things were heated. And because of the nature of their trials, they are tortured in confessions. The order was strongest in France, but exists in Portugal and Spain, where the movies take place. <br /> <br /> Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drink the blood directly from the virgin body (chest shots here, of course, it is a horror movie) and when the knights return , they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; In this sequel it all vanishes. You still have the same scene (revive, not the same footage) of those who sacrifice the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from it. So, when they come back, they kill people with their swords or ravens, which I have to say is a far less effective way to disturb your audience. There is also a time problem: in the first movie dating is much closer to the Templars, where they now say it is the 500 year anniversary of the farmers who burn these guys at stake. It will date around 1473. And the way the Templars lose their eyes is also less interesting. At first, they pulled them out by crows. Now they are simply burned out, and in a ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and maybe it was just me, but there were many people from the first movie that appeared in this movie (despite death). Not really a problem, as the film is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation, but strange no less. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who dedicates a kid to the dead while making a break for the jeep. The child's father had already been tried by this rich man to get the jeep. He stepped out and told her to find her father. It comes out of the blue, and is easily the funniest scene in the film. Of course, why the child doesn't die is out of my mind, and disappointed by horror fans. <br /> <br /> I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it gets funny, so it just ends a mediocre horror movie. Most of the film has several people who are locked up in a church. Everybody tries several attempts to go it alone to escape the blind death that surrounds them. When the movie ends, you are not at all surprised at the outcome; In fact, disappointed. If you're into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror movie, see the first movie, which has at least some innovative ideas and not so anticipated outcomes.
