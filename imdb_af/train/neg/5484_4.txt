This film is about a family trying to end the death of the mother / wife by moving to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of Genova sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of such scenes are redundant and tiring, and fail to engage the viewers emotionally. The end is very disappointing, as it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I'm disappointed and bored by Genova. The only thing good about the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genoa. Genova can serve as an extensive tourism marketing for the city, but not as a movie to enjoy.
