I saw this film at our college theater thirty years ago because I love Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the dull movie I've ever seen. It just got going with no observable point and then - it just ended. The lights came up and I watched everyone look around in confusion. Did the projectionist miss a coil? I've never had the urge to find out. All I remember about the movie is that it's a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the movie was after the completely concealed audience after the words. Fortunately, it was just an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
