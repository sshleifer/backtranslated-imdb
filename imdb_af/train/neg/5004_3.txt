Wow this is ironic since this movie has been for a while. I think someone else just reviewed it a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie just because it has Nick Stahl for the record. </ br /> <br /> The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove my INSANE, they were so Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie has the worst dialogue I've ever heard. There were too many plot turns. <br /> <br /> There is ONE scene in the movie after which the scene: "Hot Heart, Cold Gun" killing Nick Stahl's stupid girl in the shower. (Well, they were all really stupid.) But his acting was excellent. The look on his face, it reminds me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing, but it's not worth seeing the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and don't look.
