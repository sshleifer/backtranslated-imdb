It's not a movie you can really analyze for its production. The audience has become unprecedented in the history of the American film industry to date. We felt so involved that it was considered to be looking at the work of a friend. How is it possible to be objective? This is our movie, isn't it? Or is it? There can be nothing more dishonest than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audience's friend, and gives them all the naughty treatments that nanny critics would deny them. Just look at the first self-publisher, Eli Roth, who has promised that all the viscera of literally inexhaustible mainstream horror films will be exploited, just to exploit a truncated and technically incompetent work like "Hostel". <br /> <br /> David R. Ellis may not have grown the monster that was the internet response to his movie, but he was very understandably involved. He took the carnival huckster school from filmmaking to a new level and asked the fans to build what they would eventually buy. So much enthusiastic about this interactive, democratic approach to movies they missed the point - this is the most cynical form of film and marketing. Nothing is included that the filmmakers know the fans will not buy, and any old proposal that will get bombs on seats will be included. The fact that the page has become the title tells you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> Is it not just the evolution of the focus group approach? Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed for the filth of the masses. It's critical everyday that focus groups and test screens don't make good movies - why should prospective internet enthusiasts intervene differently? Because we happen to be film fans? Well, thank you for us, otherwise I might not have seen a top-notch woman, her nipple bitten by a snake. <br /> <br /> So, yes, I had fun at the movie. the bar and with a bucket of ice - but it actually has relatively little to do with the film, and rather with the atmosphere. Like Christmas, everyone was determined to have fun, no matter what. There was laughter, but I didn't know if it was at the movie or at the movie. With a movie like this, is it even a significant distinction? There are some real good things for the movie. Samuel L. Jackson gives good judgment performance, sheer self-esteem, but with a real sense of pleasure. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is really funny black comedy that doesn't follow the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The stock characters can be expected, but the total lack of tension is not. What is the point of a movie that combines two great phobias if there is no crawling threat? There are several snake jump moments, but it is incredibly bad. Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulsating image of death - the other murders are strangely flat. The demise of the wedding couple, for example, is shamefully bruised. Most of the actors fail to make an impression; It's a shame that a charismatic actress such as Julianna Margulies must look so tired (when she says two children have to close their eyes and pretend that the turbulent flight is a roller coaster, she can talk to the audience - the movie falls short ). <br /> <br /> There are worse movies, but there are many, much better; Another reviewer on this site compares this movie to 'Lake Placid', and it is as appropriate a contrast as I can imagine. The film worked so great, because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the teams were frightening, and the committee did not suggest it. The fact that the characters had a bit of depth and shade was an unexpected bonus. I don't need a post-bar midnight to have a good time with that movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will fade in time to become a mere footnote in film history. But if it's a precedent, I'm really worried about what our screens can cross over in a few years. In all likelihood, nothing will come of it. Perennial popcorn favorites - 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Alien', 'Halloween' and of course 'Star Wars' - are not produced by group think. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I'll tell you what - I didn't have half an urge for an Ingmar Bergman.
