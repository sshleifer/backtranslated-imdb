This movie was wonderful the first time I saw it when it was called 'Lost Translation'. But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman. Scarlett Johansson played in a fiery Latino woman who was played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan changed to Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silences we enjoyed in Translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 annoying items. Instead of characters that are continuous and introspective as in Translation, we get characters who give useless advice on topics they have no idea of. How can a character who carries a hundred dollar T-shirts and has never been to a Target department store expect advice from a working woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Don't think it stops him. If he doesn't give her advice, he tells her what to eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how seemingly they were in a hurry to make an appointment. Yet, the characters hold time to run another thing, whether it's the car, stopping at Arby's or just getting off their 10 items or fewer lists of things they love and hate. I was glad to shout and say, "Didn't you say you should be somewhere? What is the hook? A minute ago you were almost late, now you eat beef and think your life!" Until I saw this movie, I never really understood how something might have pushed him, but I think this movie does just that and undeservedly so. The dialogue makes the characters eastern and weympathetic ?? with the exception that I was sorry for both actors to sign for this project.
