His first movie after the longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd, shows a lot of fatigue to pull out a character that would have been a bit for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives our book professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known as a mother. It's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four evening ladies to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd is disturbed most of the time. Why would the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was on this movie that Aykroyd met the future wife, Donna Dixon. At least some good things came from this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
