Yes, I know I'm one of the few people who want to crush this movie into the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel that way. In truth, if it was advertised as a zombie movie or the like, I might have enjoyed it. But now I'm completely speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure What to spoil? Let's start with the first big mistake. If I didn't know the movie was called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and I didn't see any sequences where some people look blood, I wouldn't have seen the connection with Vampires. I mean, fearlessly ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Second bad point: What is the Metal? It seems that all young people, but especially the so-called "vampires", fall into different kinds of metal, mainly through their shirts! Don't get me wrong, I've been working in the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but no one is going to frighten me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all bands !!!)! T-shirts run around and pretend to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT ACTORS?! You mean the directors' wood friends! Words will be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is very stingy, but what difference does it make? It was a strong point and something to enjoy if the "brilliant" director did not choose to create an ARTICLE vampire topic in this movie. I wanted to see Vampires, but was treated to some stupid kids I would have loved to use my baseball bat. The filmmakers simply have to advertise the movie and say, "Cheap B-grade horror without plot, but very gore" !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of Vampirism. And it makes me sick.
