from the beginning of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself with the look of a naked woman being driven by people in dull masks to servants walking in the worst clothes what I have ever seen and all this in subtitles makes it the kind of movie you have to think twice about and if the movie moves slowly, you soon see that the vampire is not a vampire, but you have to wonder where the title came from some parts of the movie. little sense with Pierre and is dad, but if the movie comes to its real stupid end, think why make a movie this way and make sure it has a better end than it is in the head, isn't it a movie to watch basically.
