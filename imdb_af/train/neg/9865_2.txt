I recorded this movie in the hope that it would be similar to the hilarious "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended). Son, what a disappointment! The movie is shot in this fake documentary style that is announced by the office, but it fails to deliver. The reason for this is partly the tight acting, but mostly writing and directing. True, it can be funny to use every siege clich√©, it's about roleplaying, but here it is done so that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of every scene you know what the "joke" will be. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is portrayed over the top. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there is a drawer magazine titled "LOW NEWS" or a cheap 80-quiet song, it won't make much difference. With some scenes you can't help thinking. "Yes, I get why they thought it would be funny, but the way it is done takes all the momentum out of the possible joke.
