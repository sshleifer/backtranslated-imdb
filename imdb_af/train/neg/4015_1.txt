A friend told me it was another classic like "Debbie Dallas". Not anywhere near. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive actress in the porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that she is almost completely on the screen. But I read somewhere that at that time some "artistic" value had to be. But I couldn't find it. Just watch it if you're interested in the history of mainstream porn development, or appreciate art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the movie seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon and Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course they rejected.
