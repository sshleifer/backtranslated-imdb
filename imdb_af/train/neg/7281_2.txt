I had a couple of occasions during this movie. I laughed aloud while noticing the handing over of the margarine company. (<br /> <br /> There are three segments in this movie. The first one is supposed to be a spoof of 'wife' and 'career' movies.) The TampaxÂ® box was the funniest thing in this segment "Most of the cast members are not listed on IMDb. They are the lucky ones. Few other people can commit this thing to the destruction of their acting careers. <br /> <br /> The second segment is a spoof of a shark woman, sleeping her way to the top and grabbing control of big industry movies, Robert Culp has several funny moments, all physical humor, including the aforementioned act, after his character dies, the segment sinks lower and lower than Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher: by the time she becomes First Lady, I want to rip the cable out of the TV and watch snow, rather I switched to Pakistani music videos, I do not understand Urdu, or what language the videos were It was even better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story. "<br /> <br /> Then" Municipalities "came with the * big * stars, half of them on screen for less than a minute: Elisha Cook, Jr., Christopher Lloyd, Rhea Perlman, Henny Youngman, Julie Raven, Richard Widmark and ... * Robby Benson. * It is supposed to be a spoof of young police teams with hardened, substance-abusive older police who need retirement * bad * movies. The horizontal beam on the police car is very impressive. It was interesting to see old RTD buses, and a Shell petrol sign, and a US savings account - nothing of them anymore. Nagurski's "Never Stop Where You Should Get The Car" made me smile. Then they discuss how boring the young man is. Very. Back and forth on how boring he is. It was so boring as this description of how boring it is. Nagurski's law number four, "Never go to a music store that has been cut with an acetylene torch," I thought the music store was a real business in the real place the dispatcher gave. Thinking about this was more interesting than setting up the gag that followed. Young Falcone (Benson) gets shot. Very. He becomes a tough cop like Nagurski. The segment continues. On and off. And so on. It won't stop. It ruthlessly rolls, no matter how many times you want him to just * die *, so this thing will end. That doesn't mean that. It goes on and on and on. Then comes a "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" episode I've seen four times. Thank God! This unfortunate movie ended while I was getting the post.
