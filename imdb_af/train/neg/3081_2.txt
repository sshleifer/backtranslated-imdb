Good pleasure! While still maintaining those Manos: The Hands of the Level is the worst piece of spiritual torture available, Hobgoblins have come terribly close. This ... thing ... insults the audience at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least movies like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this one was a struggle to go through. I literally strangled on the couch in bed. This thing has embarrassed me - alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a hard MST3K fan and have made your mission to see every experiment, you have to think twice to see this one. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
