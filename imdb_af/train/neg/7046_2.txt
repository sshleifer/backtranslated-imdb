I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's comedy channel, so I guess innocent and obviously it was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good throw is actually wasted on a script I could have written with my left cheek after being beaten by 15th-century Inquisition martyrs. The first half is especially bad, as it has some of the dull, useless dialogue I have received in a while, and a zero comma plot to talk about. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, has to tell you everything. A few nice shot waves that hit the cold British coast, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or lots of cash to spend.
