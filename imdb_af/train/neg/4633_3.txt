As often happens, movies about self-rejecting characters do not usually make good drama. "Nancy downloading" is no exception. It is believed to be based on a true story about a woman who, at her own request, is murdered by someone she meets over the internet. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Nancy (Maria Bello) who is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who developed a golf game that successfully marketed his company for various bars and bars / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has virtually no positive qualities (except his ability to succeed in the business world). Already in the film, Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and persuaded prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex, he punishes her door masturbating in her presence. <br /> <br /> Nancy is one-note as a character. Not only did she have a loving 15-year-old marriage, but was sexually abused by her uncle when she grew up. (Fortunately, there are no flashbacks of the background in the movie). Her self-rejection takes the form of self-reduction and a consequence, she is forced into therapy. However, she has so little contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet. He is kind of a sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money, while he is having a lot of pain to start. It is revealed that Louis has two children, but they no longer see them (the children's mother wants nothing more to do with him). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then kill him. . There is a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while cutting her vaginal area with a broken glass. These scenes are displayed as flashbacks after Louis visited a visit to Albert linking him with a golf club. Louis seems to have a dual plan to see Albert: 1) Takes him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) enjoys the beat he receives. It will take a while before Louis Nancy's fate reveals. First, he forces Albert to give him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so that someone will give it in the future. Nancy's fate is, of course, that Louis finally killed her (but first showed some hesitation as he made it clear he had some feelings for her). We soon learn that Louis is being captured in the life of Nancy's murder. <br /> <br /> What exactly should we take away from a movie like Nancy download? Should we be sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is this the main point of the movie? Is compassion for Nancy justified? I do not think so. The authors of the film create a straw man in the character of Albert? Someone so cut off from his emotions that he is the one responsible for Nancy's decline. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I do not think so. They left the offensive Louis, a man who made a living by causing pain, and rob Albert of neglecting Nancy. Furthermore, his expression of love towards Nancy (before killing her) is supposed to show his "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> In the end, it doesn't matter if the filmmakers have defined where their sympathy lies with the different characters in the movie. They are so bent on tune their hearing with scenes of free violence, that Nancy is nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography.
