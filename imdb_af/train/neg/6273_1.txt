It was a nice movie to the end. The end was just one more despicable attempt to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and lay her will on the man who ultimately gave his power and control over the relationship with her. It was no coincidence that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car, as they drove to the end after he had to beg her and wanted to plead with her to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in control of all men and in control of their relationships with them. So it was a despicable movie.
