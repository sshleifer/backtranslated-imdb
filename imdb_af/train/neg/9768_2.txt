When I first hit in my happy birthday, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was surprised at the length. Both animated and horror movies share a common ground: attention from the selected audience and it should be about 90 minutes on or right. Anything more, and you'll lose most of your hearing. <br /> <br /> This 110 minutes or 20 minutes past his first was a big problem for me. I'd like to say half of this movie could have been worked out, but I'd be too generous to say it. Go ahead and watch and tell me how many screens can be edited, even without being a lead. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the passing visit, the movie was mediocre. It has been all his time to be this great secret on which of the "elite 10" kill the remaining friends. For the most part, they don't just do it, but they zoom in on a face and say pretty much, "It's this guy! No! It's this crazy!" You will spend more time with the camera that deceives you than to enjoy the movie. And don't start me at the scene. <br /> <br /> Well, it started me. I only had to try to remember at first that Melissa Sue Anderson played the character that was blind to Little House on the Prairie (later research correctly proved my suspicions) because she was really blind. Strange, as an established actress, she must have been the best of the group, but turned out the worst. The rest of the staff, except Ann (Bregman), were also bad, but she took the cake. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a group of ten friends, and one is killed immediately. off. Hardly anyone thinks twice about this "dear" friend's disappearance, so they continue in their cheerful way. Slowly, then faster, there are revelations about Virginia's (Anderson), the main character, past and her psychologist, who is a little more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most shrinking. More and more deaths are happening. <br /> <br /> What's funny is, just like the first "disappearance", the more "best buttons" disappear, the less the rest cares. Certainly, they give a few seconds of airtime to say, "Wow, (that person) just won't run out" etc, but then they're back in their sexual ways. And it's probably due to the horrible writing or maybe I was losing interest in the 30th minute, but it was really hard to keep up with who's from the group because they were all sexual partners of the next or someone will either be made by another and best friends the next scene at the MAX. SEE: the creepy man who held a mouse / gear in his pocket ?? literally ?? and was the most obvious suspect. I give the film too much credit (and time), but how he became part of the "elite 10" I will never know. <br /> <br /> But I'm going out, there's a mystery here. Why are these kids targets? Why does Virginia think she killed someone when it was never proven that one was actually slaughtered? And why would the trailer and poster demand that these killings be "Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see"? Hell, even for 1981, showed most of these in any of the first two Friday's 13th movies? coincidentally, Friday is the 13th part 2 released 2 weeks to the day of Happy Birthday to me. Maybe they are talking about when they filmed them months before, but were late at the, well-run party. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you have to rewind 3 -4x to get the ridiculous and incoherent motives, and even then, put the captions around to all the mumbling victim / murderer to get his words. Even if you get the first time, it's an incredibly cruel and hilarious final. It is almost worth watching the whole movie again, but as a drinking match. <br /> <br /> This birthday event should be avoided. This is a terrible and illogical first draft? please, please know that it requires multiple rewriting before the camera roll, it contains somehow acting or extreme about acting and it is 100% unrealistic about how people react in extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side Note: When I was a kid, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. (Still, oddly, definitely guilty pleasure, but they get harder and harder to watch as the years go by.) We've got our first video recorder, and I've tackled so many horror movies from network (or EDITED VERSIONS) TV. All I remember from happy birthday to me, got the last 10 minutes on tape, which killed me? and, of course, expressed the great secret about who the killer was. Although I saw other tracks of this movie, I think this is the first full view I had. Luckily this horrible movie didn't hurt me as a kid. I'm now older, and I can take this trash. But never again. <br /> <br /> Side Note 2: It said, that crazy "Happy Birthday to Me" song crawled into the end credits (and as a whole-time score). I think this movie (or last few minutes) had an impact on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
