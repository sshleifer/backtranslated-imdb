* WARNING * Possible spoilers below <br /> <br /> The movie is more boring than anything else. There is apparently an effort to build tension through poor light shots of empty rooms and empty lawns, but nothing works. <br /> <br /> MST3K has done a pretty good job with it, but on its own the movie is funny moments: <br /> <br /> When the false skull moves out of a pile, the woman becomes hysterical and frantic while the man (who is trying to drive) is crazy about a woman) says in a dead speech: "There is no skull there, there is no skull." <br /> <br /> When the real ghost skulls caught the man in a picnic, as if caught between first and second base.
