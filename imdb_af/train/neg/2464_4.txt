Beloved share one, the impossible planet, but who's, part of a disappointment, is "Satan's Pit." The stone hanger of something that seems to come out of the pit was - nothing comes from the well. Then ages spent crawling round-the-clock flights to stick out the story, the Cattle is a roaring thing that is empty of intelligence, so no doctor / villain confrontation I expected. The TARDIS is somehow in the pit, despite the pit not being open long after the TARDIS fell through the planet's crust. And finally another ready-made solution for no logical reason - I mean, why not put the Beast in the hole as soon as the pit is opened? Why don't you immerse him in all those years instead of keeping him down. Why not - I can go on but I lost interest ...
