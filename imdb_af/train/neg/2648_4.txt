I just finished reading a book about Anita Loos's work and the photo in TCM Magazine or MacDonald in her angel costume looked at big (impressive wings), so I thought I'd see this movie. I have never heard of the film, so I had no preconceived notions about it. Think it was a nice start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he didn't know. The scene where she appeared on the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an inoperative halo and wings that didn't stay was really engaging. I was even with the movie when Eddy went to bed and suggested her as a true angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart. Eddy "sleeps" for the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens, it doesn't matter because he just dreams. The rest of it was almost plot less and useless. I had to force myself to stick to it. And the last number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in a crazy hallucination was just freaky. <br /> <br /> Did Eddy wake up once and the original story continued, or was he really an angel married? , I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her true character. <br /> <br /> There wasn't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but the jitterbug number performed by MacDonald was like nails on a board. Totally wrong for her operational voice. Yet Eddy and MacDonald still know how to shine and show what true stars they were.
