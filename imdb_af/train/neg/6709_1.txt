I am easily entertained. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many persecutors, even though most people found them unbearable. I even enjoyed most Pauly Shore movies. There is only one movie I've seen that I can honestly say was bad ... and that was it. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater. "It's a silly movie. Why did I see it?" It's honestly the only movie I can't recommend.
