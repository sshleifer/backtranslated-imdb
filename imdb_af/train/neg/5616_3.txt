It will be short. Let me first say that I am agnostic and not really fond of xtians, especially xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a similar tone of voice to some teens who were angry with his xtian mother because he did not play video games. I couldn't take it seriously. To mention how CharlesManson thought he was Christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can be angry? I don't know it was just cheap and childish - made the opposition seem ignorant. Furthermore, the narrator was just snobbish and pretentious. Delivery was complete. I can't take this documentary seriously. Can appeal to an angry teen piss3d at his xtian mother not to let him play video games.
