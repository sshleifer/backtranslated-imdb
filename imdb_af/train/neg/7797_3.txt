This is one of the worst movies I've ever experienced, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I've heard have become illegal. <br /> <br /> As far as pure movie-making technique goes, this director is competent. He is held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the real editing, camera angles, camera movements and play station are pretty professional. I saw a lot of movies where the "director" was much worse. At least, the screens flow in a way that is not confusing and he has some clever shots here and there. Also, the forest screens had a decent atmosphere. There is just as much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a good job as far as the technical needs are concerned. There is no one in artistic merit. The scene where the camera comes, so we can urinate a man in the forest for 15 seconds, forms the artistic style of the whole movie. This is pure trash ... Total rubbish. <br /> <br /> The gore is decent for a movie in this budget series. , it is of course false but there is a lot of it, and it is very excessive. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with the deliberate camping dubbing. It was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the movie). Unfortunately, it is exaggerated, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a horrible movie, but I have to recommend it for its camp value. It's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and it sets it in a unique category.
