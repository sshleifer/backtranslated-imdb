I went to expect the movie to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment will be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but it was fun to have fun on the nonsense in the single seats. <br /> <br /> It said there were a lot of things about The Singles Ward that were totally annoying. The whole movie was badly baptized and made mouth-watering while listening to their voices very annoying. This lack of professionalism was only surpassed by the comos of Mormon-known non-business people. <br /> <br /> This film will perform well under Mormondom, especially in college communities where single-mindedness exists. However, the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (Only the pretty girls in the Singles Ward get married, do the fat, ugly people, but do all the ugly men). Finally, we realize that the whole movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com.
