I would enjoy this movie, but Van Damme just do the same old same old rubbish time and again. Poo knickers battle scenes as usual. The only thing that left this loser out was that the Russians would normally be killed. This movie is adult doggy doing the highest nature. Please, please, Van Damme gets some play lessons, you need them. Anyone who likes Damme has problems. It is a pity that the only way Van Damme ever gets working is when he writes the film, co-produces the film and plays the screen for the film. AVOID FROM DAMES AND HIS HAPPY BACK NASTY WIG. I give this movie a two out of ten, because the one with the sandman was better. To add insult to injury, I lost a flurry on this dung
