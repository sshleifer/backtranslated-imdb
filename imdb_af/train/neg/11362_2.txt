"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animation movie I've seen in the past. It says something since I took my son to see every animated release for the past 4 years. The story is generous ... trite. The vocalist is horrible, sounding cute. The humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is sensual for a Nickolodeon-type cartoon, but it is released on the big screen, not cable TV. <br /> <br /> It gets a 2 just because it's OK 3-D visual. Some of the screens had a slightly stimulating image, but we have seen much better in the past. I also doubt the urgency of the movie makers flying away from most screens in most screens. Although initially interesting, it became tired after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed like I was careless on the part of the creators. <br /> <br /> I will say so. It had a nice cool soundtrack. And for the record, my son wasn't too crazy either. Bad movie.
