I don't know what these Brady children are. First, Barry Williams boasts the public to have sex with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, and then to meet his TV mother Florence Hederson. Then Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a lot of porn movies. Then Mike (Bobby) sees Lookinland in trouble for drunken driving. Lastly, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eva (Jan) Plum might have had a little flash on the side. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early twenties during his stint on "The Surreal Life", which was initially fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship . The last episode, where she suggested a lot of nude photos with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give Christopher his birthday, was not a good move for her. And he handled it in a very mature way, just to pick up and go to clean his head. I think he always bends to her and now he finally ends. And I hate to say that, but I think his abuse is oral. The way she tortured him for an engagement ring and the way she set him up for every little thing. She also speaks openly about the fact that she was tossing with other women and it is obvious that she is still sleeping with him and men. It is not something that self-respecting man should do if he is already married to someone. If it was such a man talking to his wife and going to party every night and having sex with other people, everyone would be behind the woman to leave him. Why it should be different. What started out as a cute little bit in love with another reality concert, has blown up in a big disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, who need a lot of therapy because she cries so many stupid things like a baby. I feel sorry for her, but Chris must get rid of her because he's a good man who can't afford to be humiliated.
