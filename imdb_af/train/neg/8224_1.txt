Watch this movie? I thought to myself, what a lot of rubbish. These girls must have rocks for the brain to even vote to be part of it. Overview of time to see it, dim skies, I just rented it. The acting was below standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone who is considering watching this movie, please save your money. The movie has no credit at all. I'm a real movie buff and it's worse than 'Attack of the Green Tomatoes'. <br /> <br /> I just hope this piece of garbage doesn't cost too much. Money would be better spent on the homeless people of the world. I just hope there's no sequel in the pipeline.
