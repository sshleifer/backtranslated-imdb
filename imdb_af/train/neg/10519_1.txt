I saw a lot of movies and rarely will I ever award a movie "1", but this movie was over. <br /> <br /> The scene was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the consequences were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when I watch scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise in home / forest / school / etc and then shout "hello is someone?" - but at least they are credible when they do. This movie can't even get it. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that will make other B-horror movies like Venom and Die Mist look like academy-award-winning masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a total waste of time and I am writing this comment so anyone else thinking of watching this movie will think again . It's terrible!
