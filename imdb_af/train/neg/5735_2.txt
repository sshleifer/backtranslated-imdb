First of all, it's a low-budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low in the process. I suppose most people look at the information for this movie, just wanted a feast, and in essence, that's all it is. <br /> <br /> Plot? There is really no one. It's basically seen, but in China and a whole hell much worse. Throw? There is no period. Special effects? Totally terrible in my opinion ... There were cuts and the blood was often totally unbelievable due to quantities, splashing, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe the purpose of this movie was to make a brutal shock movie. Now, it had a huge potential on a bigger budget, but poor essay, poor dialogue, horrific acting, like video camera video shots, and simply amazing "gore," really made this movie terrific. <br /> <br /> Films are worth taking a chance against some reviews, even b-rate movies have certain occasions (blood routes were the most recent ones I've seen for the reviews was), but it was just terrible. I hope people who are considering this movie will read and comment on my comments. <br /> <br /> I'm all for brutality and shock, but making the overall unrealistic and really horrible acting a terrible experience. Save your time / money and chance something else, you won't be disappointed.
