I don't like Frosty returns and this one. Both films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. The votes could have been, but huge returns were the worst because of the unique snowman they pulled. Frosty's winter wonderland was wonderful and so was the original heartwarming drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty, the snowman was like the classic 60's and a funny line as when talking about things that aren't real and then Frosty walks up the window and he whistles what he does, but everything was poorly written and poorly animated and I barely had the plot. I saw the DVD cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so I didn't pick it until this year because the photos on the back looked a bit but I did this movie played. It was a tricky art character, just like the DVD, and it was just terrible about what was going on. I watched it at night and it was dull that I fell asleep over the whole thing. (Wait I'm always doing this when I watch something while I'm going to sleep.) But this movie was boring. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: Grade -C <br /> <br /> It's like another holiday, special bad rip-off in the cold yield and one. This one is the bad 4th successor like House alone 4 Well, I thought the movie was OK, but home alone 3 was wonderful. But it's like a bad house alone. 3 and 4 people hate it. My sister didn't look that much, because when she came into my room to look at it for 2 minutes and a half, she walked away like "I hate the animation!" I agree with her just as the 3rd comes back to Frosty. Plain awful!
