At one point when it became interesting, it never came there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, with no real point (if there was one, it was very boring). There was no action, tension or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless, so there was no caring what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All those movies were pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was shaky camera work and if there was music, it didn't hurt me like some very bad movies and the acting wasn't scary. .
