Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre 'B' mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as director. . Surely he can have another Red Skelton movie or two on his schedule! Anyway, Grand Central Murder is a disgraceful rip-off of the Thin Man films, less the white, charm and chemistry of the slate. We are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support 73 minutes of bad acting and effort. From Heflin and Virginia Gray, Nick and Nora play Char, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a PI and she is his wife and key partner. They involve a "humorous" banter with each other. See? It's completely different. Heflin is the only one here to win for bigger and better things, though he is really close to being here for a while. Virginia Gray was in another clear man, but again, let me stress, THIS MOVIE IS NEWS AS ONE, NO sir. And just as we start thinking that this movie is absolutely nothing like another movie (says THIN MAN), we really want Sam Levene to appear as the chief detective who is a bit dull and Van Heflin has to make him subtle after all the important clues. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quick, the murder is that of bitchy dusk Mida King, who likes to act on rich men until she finds an even richer one. She was played by Patricia Dane, who is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and becomes a F. There are a lot of wacky suspects, all with their own motivation to kill Mida. There is the community type, the tough talking ladies, the crook, the former lover, and a shadow theater impresario (Tom Conway, here along with the unlikely character of "Frankie Ciro"). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, jittery type, something I believe he did before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot policeman who, in a running cloth that doesn't stop, can't stop thinking about the piece of ass, he waited for him as soon as this thing is wrapped up (that's right, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a completely groundbreaking method of narrative, something we have never seen before, all the suspects were gathered in one place where they told their stories (as flashbacks) to the detective, as Rocky took mental notes to eventually the guilty person is obliged to eradicate a confession dramatically. <br /> <br /> In addition to the real picture being a dud, I thought naively that there might be some shots from the actual 1942 era Grand Central, but unfortunately, no. There is only one very short shot at the beginning. Thank you for nothing, Grand Central Murder. In short, a little bit of formula, but Heflin was okay. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out of 4
