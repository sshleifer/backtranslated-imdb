Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV production. I saw a lot of promotional material and expected a Professional Movie such as "Stormriders" - which I was offered was a low-budget movie such as "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more than worse Fight Scenes. A few good ideas - no more. I hope I get the chance to make such a movie and then I show you how to do such a movie! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS" "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
