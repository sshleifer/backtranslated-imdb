I saw one of the stage performances in Denver and have never been so impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. A body part. Nothing shocking here. I can tell my doctor: "My left arm struggled a little after tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with equal or more social commentary. It can be the "Tricep Monologues" for all the entertainment or radical commentary I have heard. The monologues were dull, but with drama, the topics were outdated, and I was alternately bored and irritated. As soon as I think I laughed, but apparently it wasn't when I was supposed to. This is certainly not a hit. Oh, and spoilers: there was a LESBIAN! - Oh, wait, maybe, come to think. An Inappropriate Funding! And a Crack Mama! It covers it.
