Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes pretty good horror movies, but he failed. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade who was condemned in the 17th century for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of bringing pain to himself, as well as to see if others are in pain as well. The story is so confusing with the flip-flop from one century to the next and I became confused about what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. All I saw was a young lady who had been let down by a foreign lesbian, who wanted to keep her, and the young lady had a lot of money with this Arabian and found that he had killed her and invaded Englund . one century after another claiming to be a descendant of the de Sade and trying to kill her because she reminded him of the mom Momoselle (who was spelled wrong) or whoever in the picture above the De Sades wall. The movie was terrible. I am surprised at Hooper to rent Englund in this movie and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part over the eyes. Englund tries to make a return from his one-time hit "Nightmare on Elm St." by using this pull in and out of needles to stick people's eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
