I saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My friend just wanted to see it because of Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel that I have wasted my time and money and told my friend it's been lately we are going to see a movie just because a certain actor / actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat. From me, since I already paid, I at least wanted to see the end, just in the hope that something would pop up, but I didn't hold my breath and luckily I became the victim of the movie just the same. <br /> <br /> It's not a black and white movie, it's a black and black one. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrars, and all sex offenders are portrayed as irreconcilable criminals and the bad ones were really bad. Speaking of a clich√© and exploiting a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's play was good as usual, but the blonde girl who was supposed to replace him was anyway desirable. Completely unconvincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational turn that is just unreal. They only use sex offenders as an excuse to offer in cheap violent acts of murder, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that seems almost unnecessary. They even have a wolf attacking people in the movie - how low can you get. <br /> <br /> I collect the movie will not come in the US and go straight to DVD. That's where it also stayed in other countries, but because it was Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth a B series movie.
