Easily the best known of all the Shakespeare plays, it's seriously left here. In the city of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been flowing for centuries, but tragedy is at hand when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. Blood shedding soon breaks ... <br /> <br /> The studio work, especially in daylight, stagnates the energy of the play seriously. This is a story earned with its energy to be shot outside. Along with this, the costumes are boring, with too many socks and ridiculous codpieces. The stage battles look terrible, with too much stretching and running to be engaging. <br /> <br /> Patrick Rowing Map is too light to be a truly effective Romeo. He controls the character's intensity when the plot goes, but his stately accents and mere, often unspeakable eyes limit his range. It is very difficult for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she catches the character's naughtiness, but a little more austerity would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles are not much better. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is good, but too many of his best lines are cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio is on stage and not on camera. He suffocates and gestures excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, who endorses his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. He has developed an edge and intensity to deliver fine screen displays over the past few years, but it's not here. The Prince can play a good role in his brief action, but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the part any authority on the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, probably his best role in this series, comes out with any dignity. His Capulet is well played and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Rather see one of the other versions of this story.
