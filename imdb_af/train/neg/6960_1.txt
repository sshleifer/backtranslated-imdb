After watching the first 20 minutes of Blanche (sorry I couldn't take it any more), I have now confirmed she is not. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real French actors participating in this tricky piece of junk. It begins with a concept that is successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical movie with anachronical tones / dialogues. It can provide brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction that avoids the dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Dorillon devastates everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, just becomes a horror movie. Horror for cinephiles who want to be amazed and shocked to see fine actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.
