1st watched 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty lame gangster movie about a Godfather-like family in Brooklyn who wants to say four words many and kill people. The only thing that matters here is their attempt to show that the feds are much like the gang. This is the only attempt at good movies. The rest of the movie was predictable and cheap. The quality of photography on some of the screens in the bars and heavy joints almost thought there was a problem with your DVD player due to the bad contrasts and some of the actors were sometimes difficult to hear because of the bad sound. The play was hardly many characters from all your favorite gangsters of better movies with cornish names like Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the plot also followed the patterns properly. So, watch a better gangster movie before you spend your money for this one.
