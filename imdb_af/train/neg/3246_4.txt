The plot of 'House of Games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful writer and psychologist is crushed by a gang of greats, but if she discovers the bad part of her that excites what they do, she eventually gets her revenge . It's about the field: but someone has to take responsibility because it is performed by dolls. This must be the director Mamet. Lindsay Crouse had a varied and steady TV and film career, so she can't do that all the time. She is supposed to calculate upscale, cool, controlled professionals, with a quick, fast-paced, fun-filled lady, as shown by changing beige pants (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear). ) for floppy flowers. But everyone seems to speak their lines the same cut, precise way; I imagine Mamet wants to make sure that a syllable of his scintillating script is not missed. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and tension that he is supposed to create. Sometimes 'House of Games' loses touch with how people actually act or speak, and just become a mechanism to turn the plot out. The clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help either. The ultimate consequence is that the only entertainment you receive is guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do it, the sooner you will get bored with the robot two-dimensional displays. And they smoke too much!
