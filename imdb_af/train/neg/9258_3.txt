It's a pity someone decided to turn to the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three movies, as far as it even copies how people die and what will happen to the key characters in the future, basically trying to hit and fail three movies. It fails to create even a nice atmosphere for one (except for the strange exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be grateful for is that there was no Omen V.
