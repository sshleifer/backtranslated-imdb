To give credit where it is due, just earn the technicolor, costumes and sets a fair mention. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The writing is about as cumbersome as you possibly can imagine, and not the accidental Bing or William Bendix or Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a stock costume heroine role that she needs to look adorable at Bing and a little bit different except to double a few uninspired ballads in a voice that is probably called for the event. Just plain, terrible! Mark Twain's white is not clear in any of the script. Only the hard-crosby fans can appreciate this debris of a non-inspired film. Even the extras seem like they don't know what they're supposed to do. <br /> <br /> Summary: Dust as dish water. Not recommended, even for children.
