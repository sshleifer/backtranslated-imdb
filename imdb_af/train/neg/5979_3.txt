Pokemon 3 is a little over three or four episodes of the TV series, joined together without the usual advertising. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fighting and a resolution where everyone is ultimately happy), and there's nothing original or unusual in animation. Some of the holes in the plot are completed (about the final credits!) Without explanation, and everything is just a bit too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why does it look on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both my boys enjoy Pokemon, and by my interest in what they want, we are closer. Watching a movie in a theater is different from seeing it on the tube, and my boys enjoy the full movie experience. I gave the movie a 4, mostly from my children's point of view. <br /> <br />
