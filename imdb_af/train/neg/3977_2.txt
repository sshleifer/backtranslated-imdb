Identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen clicked into sitcoms like "Two of a Child", I have never seen them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, Hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a Summer Intern program, but not long after starting their work, they are fired immediately for a series of accidents. But the man who owns the company in which they work, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their jobs, and those they do slowly prove useful assets and talented (fashion) artists and help stop that average take over man. the company. Also with Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can see that this movie was made to go straight to the video, the camera work is completely incompatible, and it doesn't help if you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to watch, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities. I knew before they watched that they would not interest me in any way (they are not even so beautiful) terrible garbage of garbage film. Nice arm!
