Having seen the poster of the movie Smother, I knew I was going to experience one of those unbearable movie experiences that made me look. Still, I felt a little optimism because the movie had a solid role I thought would save the movie. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. Mom is a terrible movie, but it is not exceptional. That's the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Smother's script (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something that says they have nothing but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor. I didn't even laugh at watching this movie once. Besides, the solid object I've mentioned before is absolutely wasted. After the large number of garbage she is involved (such as the monumental atrocious and impeccable because I said it), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career is extinguishing. But it is impossible to forget the excellent performances. she has previo introduced us decades, to movies like Annie Hall or Baby Boom. At Smother she made her best effort with her performance, but her character was so terribly written that she couldn't do anything about it. Dax Shepard left me a good impression with his solid performances on the movies Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However he does what he can with his character.Mike White also makes a good effort, but he does not reach too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as he has shown on films like the good girl and school of rock), so I would like to see him be one of the screenwriters of this movie, rather than just dealing with it. Life Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors: wasted. <br /> <br /> Smother's worst failure is absolutely boring and infallible. His script is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we've seen on sit-coms.Stay far away from this crazy comedy.
