This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateur special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very clear that the blood is strawberry syrup or another syrup variation. However, I thought I saw all the possible lows that could hit the Sci-Fi channel. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand in a rubber sock that is glazed with syrup? This is the most important Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sockets. A talking hand comes from the intestines of the victims, and the Vampire on the Vampire Hunter's team can speak to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvania. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvania? And isn't that Transylvania in Romania? So don't they have to speak Romanian? Why would a small town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks, with your fingers moving clearly inside the Aliens' heads; then you have to handle the other alien vampires. There are the "Leatherfaces" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there is the habit ugly that everyone has many facial teachings. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are traitors and sneak into space colonies so they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that this Space Vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think everything above is funny and worth laughing, you should reject the third rate of Network TV that make up this team of stereotypical angels who are constantly fighting each other. Why should almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie use lead characters that are annoying, oblique, rough or just totally impersonal? I was hoping that the talk would win rubber socks.
