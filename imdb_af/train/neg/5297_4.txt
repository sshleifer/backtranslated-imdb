It's really my mind when someone comes up with such a movie and claims it's one of the worst movies there is. It's by no means one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst. Look like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night brings Charlie the worst. The movie has decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for much more obscure movie slasher. <br /> <br /> The movie does not die on the screen, there is one death where you see its pruning ripped in a neck, but all the other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen doesn't mean it's not a slasher movie, but a bad one. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film wasn't going to be taken too seriously. The film came at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it was definitely a reflection on traditional shield elements, which were done in a tongue in the cheek. For example, after a killing, Charlie goes to the town's "welcome" sign and marks the population one less. This is something that can only get a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're into slasher movies, this movie definitely gives a watch. It's slightly different from your usual slasher movie with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The comedy of the movie tells the audience to relax and don't take the movie so seriously. You may forget the movie, you can remember it. I will remember it because I love the name.
