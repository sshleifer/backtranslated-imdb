Greenaway seems to have a habit of deliberately trying to discourage his viewers. This film opens with obscene and purposeful, meaningless, accidental incest. This is Greenaway's big problem. He prefers to prepare for something that makes sense. Technical skills are not enough. He's just a little wrong for perversion.
