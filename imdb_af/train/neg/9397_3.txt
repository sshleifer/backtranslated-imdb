I saw most of the RMFTM episodes as a teenager at the Cliffhanger Theater a few years ago after midnight at a local station and when the Mystery Science Theater got up there in the early nineties. The time wasn't that nice. <br /> <br /> I can definitely make allowances for the special effects, which was pretty impressive for a low budget 50 series (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman's in his TV show) . And I can also make grants for the ahem, acting, and fighting choreography. except for the man who plays the ruler of the moon men. He is incredibly disgusted. He looks and acts like the fellow who comes to repair your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the corny dialogue works right - everyone drops their lines like strings of crackers, without wasted time or breaks for things like "thought" or "introspection". As everyone does, the viewer finds it after a while, and even after my modern sensitivity it doesn't save much. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is the writing and plot. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking soda-fired rocket ships, or a flying pack containing the buttons "up / down" and "fast / slow". I'm not even bothered by the falsity of the decisions made to the stone hangers ending every chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are more stupid than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And even though the dialogue clips are like a fast train, the plot goes back and forth through the same movements. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando Cody and his partner are at the forefront of a top-secret high-tech science laboratory accused of protecting Earth (or at least the US) against treacherous alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They don't even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk right in and knock the shit out of the Cody and his staff ... not once (perhaps understandably) but many times. They even kidnap his female assistant on the second three. And they never get smarter. To prove my point further, show me how Cody jumps into his flying suit and flies around in trouble and actually never looks to catch anyone. He does it over and over and over. Cody also flies his ship to the Moon (the woman assistant comes to cook), stays about 30 seconds, and turns around and returns. Cody catches one of the Atomic Ray guns ... and immediately loses it to the bad guys because he can't be bothered to close it. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you will think that if Cody's efforts were so important to save the US from the Moon Hundreds, he might be able to ask for some carabiner soldiers, some helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of just working with the local police. It was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> It's all pretty hard to stomach. I appreciate the fact that the creators were very limited in the size of their story by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is a pretty tough one (even though he loses half his fist fights). But I just can't help shouting "BY! LOCK THE DOOROR !!" when the gangsters simply walk in his lab, or try to blow up the ship, and there are NO security measures at the landing site in place ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> That's right. Of the three republicans I watched, Phantom Creeps had a better plot, and 'Undersea Kingdom' had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than 'Radar Men', but it's a good time warmer. <br /> <br /> VAT ... why "Radar" men? They didn't use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Don't be the title "Atomic Ray Gun Men From the Moon"?
