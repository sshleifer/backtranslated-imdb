"Algie, the Miner" is a bad and indecent silent comedy. The timing of the slapstick is completely down. This is the kind of humor with certain rows that makes you wonder if they are supposed to be funny or not. However, the real quality of the film is irrelevant. It is mandatory to watch for movie buffs mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is a beloved man who in many early films is much like the stereotypical "pansy". The film has the homophobic attitude of time. "Algie, the Miner" is very terrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
