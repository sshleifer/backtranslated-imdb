Yes, I admit I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I couldn't help but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First, with the Million Dollar Man (ex-professional wrestler) on their program, and now it. <br /> <br /> The Omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies. It was rather amusing, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it so inaccurate. The movie follows what is known as the "Bible Code" rather than following the actual Biblical Scripture. This film was made extremely poor; from his writing to his straight hilariously horrible acting. It is depressed that people actually put effort into this movie. It looked more like a late night movie that someone watched on the US channel, or a straight home video, rather than a theater release. <br /> <br /> I recommend not watching this movie, even if your life was dependent on it.
