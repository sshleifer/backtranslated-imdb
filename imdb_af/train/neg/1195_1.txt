It's the only worst movie I've ever seen. I can't express how bad it is. I wanted to kill myself many times through this horrific experience, just to end the pain. I recommend watching this movie, you struggle, then you will know at least a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD, and when it initially added that Jesus followed them, I was so excited ... then I finally wanted to kill myself. I mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of the cinema ... Just say! Monkeys could have done a better job of changing this trash. At least they would have thrown feces and faded some of the garbage. It would have made it better to see nothing of the horror. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that I didn't get the jokes, it's that they were not just funny, they repeated themselves like twenty repeats. Apparently something is not funny unless you see it like a million times. <br /> <br /> Don't see it under any circumstances. People named 'Manos the Hands of Fate' as the world's worst movie. I also saw it and agreed that it was bad ... but ALS is the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is much worse. <br /> <br /> It does get a lot of hard language, but I can't write it, so just think I've sown a whole lot.
