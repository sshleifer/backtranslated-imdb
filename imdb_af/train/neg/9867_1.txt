This saw a show of this before last year's awards season, didn't really know why they were spending them after the vote ended, but whatever for exposure, but the film was a modest mess. Sure, some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way, but none of the characters really felt to me. There wasn't one person I could link to, and I think that's where it failed me. Certainly, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive to Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if it's not been exploited to the point of futility. The whole trial feels fake, the lighting, the casting, the display of the terrible visual effects (which is supposed to be deliberate, I can say, and so everyone else can, no one laughs with you). Anyway, I hope it makes it at least for sale on DVD, I don't want a project that many people obviously take a lot of effort to get completely unnoticed. But that's somehow. Drilling trips on that.
