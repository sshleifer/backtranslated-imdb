It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that it is a thin story is bad enough, that it is addicted to the subject of soccer violence, it is 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but had it open-minded enough to even get the way the authors did it to Elijah Wood's character Matt. Hooligan scene to accept. <br /> <br /> But the movie throws inaccuracy at inaccuracy to the point that everyone at the center of the movie makes you harder than the time before. <br /> <br /> Let's make a few things clear: Hooligans are not inclined to prepare their own bar. -or-the-mill league game; they do not try to kill each other; they only do Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not). They certainly did not, if they had taken an exception to a new firm member, go to their competing firms' pie and mash territory. And I would like to meet the hoole that will go to his firm's top boy and go to the competitive firm. (Although you can scratch what I said to kill each other if they exist). <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm not a movie about the subject yet. â€œI have some fantasy grills, but it's the same scale as the firm for impeccability. <br /> <br /> I found it ironic that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character because he is a cocaine user, when it is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The movie does not choose to challenge Wood's morale and rather push any coke-using firm. <br /> <br /> I can keep going, but I think I've made my point. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it is highly unattractive, and I'm sure I didn't spend the whole movie, and made more of it, I'd guess what's going on rather than what I did. And believe me, I was good at it. <br /> <br /> I get the clear impression. This film is aimed at men, hoping that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues raised. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the makers have completely failed. It's too unrealistic to enjoy anyone knowing the scene, and I can't believe the kind of woman looking for emotional movies will give a damn about any of the characters who have given their violent tendencies . <br /> <br /> Are there good points? Perhaps the combat scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed with a slow-motion, certainly not when it's a fight, as the point is a while, anyway. funny, as unrealistic moments. Wood's journey to school aroused a smile for me. But a few soft funny moments don't matter for two hours of complete dross. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid it like the plague if you do not have to develop the misconceptions of the scene further if you are not in the know. If you are American, you can enjoy it because it is clearly adapted to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is vague, predictable and ultimately at the top.
