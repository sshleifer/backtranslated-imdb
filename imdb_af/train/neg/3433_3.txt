It's such a strange movie, you can call it awful or if you sit with friends, it can give you a killer lagon. Strange comes again and again. Shot amateurishly, even acted worse and the directions, maybe not. The special effects are funny, but the music accompanying a flying devil's baby will surely be the biggest hit. See it if you have time to kill. But don't, don't even try to take it seriously. Suppose to be a tribute to 'Porno Holocaust'. Since I didn't see it, I can accept that it is so bad. Must have given it 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets a 3. Excessive gore, the only thing someone worked on. Stay away if you are tired, more gore than laughter. Wondering if the makers had a laugh to make it?
