I never liked much of the Myra movie, I appreciate how it printed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Definitely Miss Welch's costume has become an iconic image, although I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it is all about. <br /> <br /> I watched Myra for a few years at FMC. ago and did not think it was better over the years. There is a segment about this in the gift books Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History, where it is given proper credit to such big stars which were then an outrageous production. But IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be an attack, and so busy shocking it doesn't inform, engage or entertain ---
