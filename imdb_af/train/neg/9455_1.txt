Well, I think I know the answer to that question. For the money! We were so bombed with Cat In The Hat ads and merchandise that we almost believe there should be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I had to give it another chance. Well, I had to go with my instincts. It was a full piece of Hollywood waste. Again prove that the average person can be programmed to believe anything they say is good, should be good. Of course, apart from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it started with a moth eaten. It is full of unsuccessful attempts at senseless humor and terrible pastel. It jumps over the universe without destination or direction. It is then assembled, ............................ Yes, I will say, BAD WHERE! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the cat meant to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were also not a prize, but Mr Myers had to disappear somewhere under a rock until he was ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save Your Money!
