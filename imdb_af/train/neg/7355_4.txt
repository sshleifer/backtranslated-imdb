Don't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies, but enough is already there: Death on the Nile. Everyone did this one! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how this was done. So I say enough! Mr. Suchet could have used that wonderful talent in another of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the acting by all the actors was fantastic. The sets were great and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was amazed at how "terrible" he was watching. I hope he doesn't look like that in the "real" life! I honestly can't remember other movies or the whole end. Somehow I don't think so. I thought it was a very brilliant touch or mrs. Christie wrote it that way. I would love to end it up and throw it away in jail!
