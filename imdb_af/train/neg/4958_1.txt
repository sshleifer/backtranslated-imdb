Not only did they get the characters wrong, not just sucking the voices. Not only do the authors need to get friends. Not only are the drawings really rough, but it seems to have been created mainly for ages 1-6. The only episode I have ever seen of this show that made me look was "A Mattter Of Family" because I had the Robin character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. For example: In BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, yes? Over a story of two episodes, he changes into the unlikely villain, TwoFace. In the "Show" Bruce is Friends with the Ethan man, and over a two episode story, he turns into the unlikely villain ClayFace. It was just a tiny example (it can't even be true), but in short, it's the WORST effort on a Batman series. And it says something.
