How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise, diminishes to make this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still looks fit and attractive, but for some reason seems scared. I can understand her fear; fear that this 3-star stinker will somehow be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of the lovely Adam Wes. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in good shape for a man who is his age. His action is sensible here, but the writing is so bad that it is difficult to even listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The movie is a rip-off of the classic Brando biker flick, The Wild Ones; Outside biker gang is out of control in a small town. The cyclists look like a moderate group here and I don't want them to date my sister. The play is stiff and wood, and the story plot is as old as sand. Hellriders are hell to watch!
