This movie looks in the middle of the beginning, introduces peripheral devices as if they were significant and offers main characters without any dust and paper thun and / or impenetrable storytelling. Hardly anyone has a credible or observable motivation for their actions in this movie. The plot rambles and eventually goes nowhere, the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best of his actors. It almost felt like a first half of this movie, but it was never made. <br /> <br /> We are told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably become an Arctic desert. Nevertheless, it seems that it has not caused much of the general population and that the government has little concern. <br /> <br /> We're presented with the "evil corporation" in Eugenics, but it's really just a convenient intention to fill the universe with a few power-suppressing minions. The entire "Eugenics-is-bath" double-entender is heavy-handed and never really comes out here. We need to care about the central characters, but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes down as a 1-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization rape. <br /> <br /> On the "earthquake" digitally animated world created here, everyone I can say is about the same time this movie was made, several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and credible results. <br /> <br /> After spending the time watching this movie, the most burning question in my mind was, "so what?"
