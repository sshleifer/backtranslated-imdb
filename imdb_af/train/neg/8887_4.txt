Good movies can't just be based on a beautiful garden and hill. Surprised to see it won two awards. Extremely overstated. I've seen those kind of movies from China, visually beautiful, but also with lots of fascinating to say, well, more than 10 years ago and I'm sure there's more to come. It's not one of them, I'm afraid.
