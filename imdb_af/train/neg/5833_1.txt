Of course, 3kg is just a self-indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and unlike Gray's Anatomy, brain surgery cases are not even interesting. This program is supposed to be in a leading center for neurological cases - but there is nothing interesting or exciting! Not even the so-called pathetic "feud" between him and a rival adds something to the performance and does not do the hallucinations either. In the pilot, there was a brief insight into the social life of the leaders as a passover! boring and useless. <br /> <br /> This show is pants, at the moment there are a lot of medical plays and it doesn't matter how much it can be.
