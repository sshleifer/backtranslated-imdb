I recently bought the DVD, just forget how much I hated the movie version of "A Chorus Line". Every change that the director Attenborough made to the story failed. <br /> <br /> By making the direct relationship of the Cassie ratio so prominent, the entire ensemble premise sails out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the music numbers are pushed up and rushed. The show's hit song breaks the whole meaning when given to Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The overall stage is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm a 2 is because some of the big numbers can still be enjoyed despite the film's effort to express every bit of joy and spontaneity from it.
