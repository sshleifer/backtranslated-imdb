I'm surprised that the judges @ IMDb gave this TV movie a high score as they did. It is a harmless, sweet, uncomplicated clich√© of a movie that has had two major names in the past (both done a decent job), but this film series of the low budget works every day of the week. can see smaller cable channels. I like good romance as well as anyone, but like my wife and I watched it - and before we see the rating, we said, "There are people who are going to judge this movie just because there is nothing about it not to challenge their brains, their faith, their level of comfort or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good movie (and away from her is an example), but it was amateur hour as this one "Surely another in a long line of sadly insufficient holiday movies. Look at the family stone."
