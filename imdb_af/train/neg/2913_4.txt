It is of course very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, but I would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. Starting from the writing, I believe it was not a wise one as some might think. especially the falsity of the dialogue, which places the audience in a position, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations, which makes the film unbearable most of the times. it also has a clear end; You can easily guess the killer from the start. The worst part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people, such as professionals right away! have they ever looked for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medical staff, to act as professionals and to use everyone The medical terms that even ordinary people cannot use ????? !!!!!! Also in the scene where staff were looking for the most dangerous patient, without any weapon to protect themselves, was another strange point of the film. and that scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir"! it is not the only weak part of the movie. There were also many preschools in the film. The portrayal of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal. The appearance of Togan is also the worst mistake he could make in his first movie! The fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews given by the actor just made people be curious and force them to see it. Gen is a total disappointment. I wonder if Sahan wasn't so familiar, could Togan shoot this movie, with so much of the budget? I hope Togan will realize that it is not fashionable to play a role as a director as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! He must be aware that he is not Hitchcock or Shyamalan !! Hopefully he will be more cautious and creative next time in this great industry!
