OK, this movie had a terrible point of departure. Be serious according to the movie they have just been through an apocalyptic war, but they have money to buy big robots and put them together. Each country decides rather than invest in rebuilding their country. They would rather fight with robots that no one can afford. Here's a better idea, we can rely on our most unknown resource, jocks, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says about the director, what about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give this movie a little credit, not just because of the director, maybe he fell asleep? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was so cute and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I actually had a good time watching it, except for the cowboy mentor who is an assassin. (I trust, no one will see this man as an assassin. It's a surprise, how nice). a jungle you anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k didn't do this one. However, I give a two star rating because nothing can be as bad as "manos the hands of fate." <br /> <br /> The budget doesn't matter, I've seen enough reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets. like cube. The storyline wasn't even likely and I saw better at school games. Certainly, they could have paid an eleven-year-old from any middle school game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, pick it up, it's a fun movie to watch.
