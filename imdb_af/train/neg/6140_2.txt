This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it is not a comedy. One classic scene involves Kurt Thomas, who just happens to find a pomp horse in the middle of a town square (which he uses to pump the bad guys.) Another step in the "Crazy Village". Too bad is this movie not made to be a farce, or it can get better ratings.
