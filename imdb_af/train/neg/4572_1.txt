This film regularly extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify uncensored ideas, with such statements, such as 'we all create our own reality'. <br /> <br /> Sorry, people are true to all of us, not just credible. . <br /> <br /> The notion that "anything is possible" does not hold water closer: if anything is possible, there are conflicting things possible and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to postmodern nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to evade established truths so that all ideas are grounded and stupid. <br /> <br /> To quote the scientific writer Philip K. Dick, who said so well: "Reality is what doesn't fail if you don't believe it."
