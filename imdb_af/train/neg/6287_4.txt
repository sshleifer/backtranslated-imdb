I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman who one day sees herself in her own car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First, the title. The broken? The Broken ... what? What's broken? The ... oh wait ... I get it, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, it's almost the only thing that goes for it. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is not that bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in 'Mirrors'. A cross between the raids of the body cutters and mirrors, and a fairly mediocre one. A better-suited title will be 'The Boring' as it depicts every scene for bloody ages. Or perhaps 'The confusion', since it does not explain anything at all, not in the narrative or in the story itself, just a vague idea of ​​evil copies and somugasug, with deadly cheap scarce and scenes, but nothing tangible. It's just mess. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the acting and the special effects are pretty good, but then it's not a difficult role to do. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, a little confused, and not similar in the EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and do not look at this one. Simply put, there are better spulters out there.
