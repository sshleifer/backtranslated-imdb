The Wicker Man. I'm so angry that I can't write a proper comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ludicrous, thinly tied, and totally-just paralyzed. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it, it would be at least decent. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> I felt that much of the movie was left on the cutter floor, and even though it was finished - the movie was just crazy and stupid. <br /> <br /> In the end, you are mouth agape, minds frozen and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on the opening day with so much hate. People got ready in small groups in the mall, four floors of the theater near the entrance. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so crazy that he wouldn't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
