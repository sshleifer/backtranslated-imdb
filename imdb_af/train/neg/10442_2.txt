All internet buzz aside, this movie was terrible. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie, and they totally missed out. There were only a few good parts, and some good lines by Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All the internet joke was miles better than the real movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, this joke will hopefully die. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of obstructed trash. If you're looking for something funny and entertaining, just go to Snake on a blog.
