I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my dad. First, I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. However, the film itself was poor and the play was terrible. The biggest problem I had with the movie was the second half with Nichole Timmons and dad Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part of the story were not quite correct. My father had psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without injuring her. He loved her like a daughter and was among the thoughts that he was saving her some kind of damage or neglect that he probably believed was from her mother who gave her little attention over the 3 plus years my dad took care of her and promptly raised her so that her mother could flourish. The film portrayed my father in a way that he would somehow want to shape or shape her. The funny thing is that Nichole spent many nights at my father's place, while Sharon did or did whatever she did. The reason my dad originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be considered weapons on his truck. My dad was a landscaper. The items they considered as weapons were landscape instruments he always kept in his truck. My recommendation is to take this movie with a salt grain, it is a good story and based on real events, but the details of the movie (at least the Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park section) are largely inaccurate and portray the failure from the director, discover the truth to tell the story. The funny thing is that if the director had questioned any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would have said exactly what I had posted here.
