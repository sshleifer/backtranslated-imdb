When my own child begs me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to clear my eyes. I wanted to get through the screen and Mike Myers slammed to sacrifice the last shield of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life that I watched and immediately wanted to "unwatch", if at all possible. The other films are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than the crap in the hat. <br /> <br /> Tonight I can sleep myself in a vain attempt to forget that I've ever seen this blasphemy on the good Seuss name. <br /> <br /> For Mike Myers I say to Austin or even raised Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
