As soft as I can, I believe this movie is a waste of time. I didn't find it the 'hot, emotionally satisfying' movie that others did. I found it boring, with music derived from the movie. The story was thin, the characters over-drawn, and the pedestrian pedestrian. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write more about this movie, so I make the 10 line minimum. There is actually no more to say and shortness is important, but IMDb has its minimums, so go here. <br /> <br /> Young eager child finds nascent talent, seeking time with aging, embittered mentor despite father's cartoon-like homophobia. Aging, embittered mentor seems to drink a lot and learn very little. conflict arises. While I don't think it's a devastator, I added the warning if someone feels that much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly I just found the movie boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. I honestly do not understand what little fuss it is, mostly on this site, about the transcendent quality of this movie. I think it's really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller said earlier, "Maybe I'm wrong."
