It's just somewhat appealing to fans of "bad movie" entertainment. It is more worthwhile for students of 1970's pop culture: the fashions, the furniture, the attitudes and the great female lib moment of the early 1970s, when it was still fresh and novel for an independent independent woman to exist. <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a monetary reward as a stuttering career (after everything a flight attendant but a waitress at 30,000 feet - it also goes for the males ). slept with several men, can protect herself and others (with karate) and not tied to anything. It is the kind of emancipated woman who scares the juices of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe no woman is without a man. <br /> <br /> The "sexy flight attendant" was a powerful archetype from the late 1960s to 1970s (geez, even on "The Partridge Family", I remember, swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid who is constantly joining hostesses) and from For this point of view, this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of pre-Aids, free love, women-lib, swaying seventies. However, the plot is very terrible. And for the cavemen in the audience, there are few bare breasts to look at.
