I bought this movie at a car start sale, so I didn't expect it to be a horror movie at the same level as a nightmare on Elmstraat (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be pretty nice to watch. However, it doesn't seem to be enjoyable, but the acting and the general movie were mock-able, as the ways in which the 'unsees murder' killed his victims and how all the people killed are just blond blond women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blonde women in danger, the majority are dying. 2) Man survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I saved you two odd hours by summarizing this poor excuse for a horror movie so you're lucky enough to not watch.
