When I see this, I noticed the ad positions mainly. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. This is one product placement after another. It is very clear how this movie got its funding. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is laughing. Any Dick should never get a job, because he plays the same lame character. The "story" is just a background for this very long commercial. I can't believe this movie was even considered for theater release. The longer you watch this movie, the more you are ashamed of everyone involved. The only small savings spouse is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who get almost no screen-time as Jessica's cousin. I'm ashamed. I watched the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this one.
