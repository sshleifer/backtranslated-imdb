I recently saw it at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the feature-length director-debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and, based on my observation, it must be her last. I hate movies that are so indisputable that you fall apart almost every scene. This movie immediately lets you scratch your head. as it starts a young photographer and his friend working for an international aid organization, a peaceful ride through the Taleban-controlled mountains. Afghanistan has a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to see how Talliban fighters are equipped with rocket riders, machine guns, guns, handguns and grenades, carrying all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all these things when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who gives a hand grenade to the tiles killing his girlfriend. Being thrown away by hand, they cannot be more than 50 meters away, but somehow they get away. His girlfriend was blown up and he took a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that killed her and won a prize as a photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as it starts. The following year, Bob finds himself on a command for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and puts herself in her cunning underworld of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I'll give it a 4.0 out of 10.
