After looking at the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to pan it out - but after reading the other comments, I didn't have the heart. Obviously, this is a movie that worked very well for children of a certain age. Well, don't let me be a complete Grinch; It may still work for some children - if they are not too media-saturated and do not become visually over-sophisticated, eg. from watching LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you are an adult, stay away; You won't enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The good bits: Barbara Kellerman as the Witch, especially in her early scenes with Edmund, just create the right mix of charismatic evil and determined madness. (At the rock table she goes a little over.) Michael Aldridge in the small role of professor and Jeffrey S. Perry as mr. Tumnus also has the kind of polished, skillful acting that we expect from the best BBC. dramas. And the Aslan costume works very well, considering wonderfully well. They just got the eyes right. <br /> <br /> The bad bits: almost everything else, but especially two areas. One, the decisive one. England is full of good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British schoolchildren. How could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs? They move like wooden soldiers and speak so well. Peter has no gravitas or charisma (and is visibly shorter than his so-called younger brothers and sisters); Edmund is not sloppy; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatic, visible, drastically wrong for this part I can't imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Two, the animal costumes. Again, it seems that they have worked for some children. If the kids are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting, credible characters, they may be captivated by this movie. But for a viewer with the sophistication of, a 12-year-old who saw Azkaban's prisoner says? When Mr. Beaver comes out of the back of the tree, there will be many cruel believers. The costumes just don't work - I couldn't, and I don't think any adult or modern teenager could stop believing when you look at Mister Beaver. The drawn animation later (grabons, etc.) works better, is easier to take. <br /> <br /> So: ten stars for the very young and synthetic soul; everyone reads or reads the book again and looks at the far better movie that rolls into your imagination.
