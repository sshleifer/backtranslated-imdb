This movie is the biggest steaming pile of what you know from Wichita Kansas, and I know 90% of the movie was Bogus. Apart from the names of some of the victims, nothing else was right. The movie looks like it's made with dad's handy camera. It has footage that I believe came from another movie with stock from a butchery. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for their pleasure, but because of the bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very dim and short end. It was a struggle to look it through to the end. I recommend you don't waste your money on this movie or you'll be sorry. Crunch
