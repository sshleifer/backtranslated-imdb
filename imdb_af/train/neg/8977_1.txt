A women's country singer named "Big T" - seriously, it calls her her - runs her burgeoning musical career and her life in the company of a drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, including his father's alcoholic, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where it leads. Meanwhile, there is music, like Parton, with her liquid vocal talents, songs to songs (at least half a dozen of them over Texas). Get rid of this mess and check her in nine to fifty or steal MAGNOLIAS instead.
