I caught it on Family Channel a few months ago, and decided to remind me of the TV show of my youth with my 4-year-old daughter. I had to take a couple of psychedelic mushrooms, because that's just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with annoying forgetful songs, the required boxing effects and comos by stars beyond their collective primary, it looks like someone's good acid journey. Speaking whistles, British children too old for this kind of crap ... in the words of Krusty the Klown "Uuuuuugggghhhhh! Where have I been?" If you're a big fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; Otherwise, unless you're willing to get in before you look, stay far, far, far away.
