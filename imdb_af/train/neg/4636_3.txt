The "confidential" part was intended to haunt the popular appeal of the same magazine of the same name, while the foreclosure theme was tied up with main conference investigations of the day. Despite the A-grade B film and some good script ideas, the movie stays 73 minutes long. It's a cheap jack production all the way. What is needed to postpone the poor production values ​​is a little imagination, especially from the uninspired director Sidney Salkow. Some daylight shots, for example, would have helped to ease the success of the dry studio sets. A stylish assassin like Anthony Mann might have done something about the choral material, but Salkow treated it as just another payday exercise. It is a pity that Brian Keith's typical low-key style does not work here, like woodcut and slow, while cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. going over the top like a game eye drunk. It is clear that Salkow is not a director of the actor. But you have to hand it over to those bitter little Beverly Garland number dealing with her role with distinctive pain and devotion. Too bad, she wasn't in control. My advice - Save it, unless you're in ridiculous barmaids that do nothing but beat whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50's.
