1) I am not a weapons expert, but even I can see the difference between US military rifles in WWI and WWII. In the film we can see privates, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in the year 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (also known as "Silent Death"), which privately used until World War II. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield needed recharge after each shot. Little difference?! 2) German army suits also borrowed from 1940 years. Especially - helmets. German helmets to end WWI has significant pike tops, we can't even see one in film. And if we make some additional searches in archives - how much truth is this "True Story"? I'm surprised how much "truth" film directors can be in pursuit of cheap reproduction.
