There was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talented hack that has done it should teach his craft. All his characters in this movie were so unlikely to give me less. The best point in this movie was the final credits and the hour long shower, because I felt so dirty that I wasted money on this stinking cargo. Hey genius .... triads and yakuza come from two different places and learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this feeling is so tackled and useless. This DVD proves useful. I love my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So kids don't waste your money on this crap hostel instead.
