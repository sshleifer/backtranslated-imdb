This movie shows a live animal clip mutilation of an animal hacked by a mug and rags its skin. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but I watch movies based on the fact that what I'm watching doesn't actually happen on the screen. These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies. They are meant to show people who belong to certain organizations to help the terrible things that people can do to other species. <br /> <br /> It must be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to work together to get this movie out of the market! <br /> <br /> This movie must be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.
