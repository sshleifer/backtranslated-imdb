This movie had so much potential. Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that so much detail is overlooked in this movie, it's ridiculous. Too much time and effort has been spent in the film on Dahmer's homosexual trends and alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origin of any villain is always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the movie does he speak his adolescence when he starts killing and mutilating small animals? Instead, we are giving a staggering variety of flashbacks that try to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the main issue in Dahmer's development. The reason why the country became so intriguing with this story was also the details - how it had stored the bodies in its apartment and the lengths and measures it had taken to achieve it; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh, etc. I can keep on but, too briefly, too many backlinks in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good things you would expect to see when the title of the movie is "Dahmer."
