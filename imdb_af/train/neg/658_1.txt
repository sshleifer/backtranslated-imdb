I wish I could give this movie zero out of ten. Before going to the movie the day after it came out, I got IMDb to review the comment. A comment made the film predictable and cheesy with a terrible dialogue. I never go through other people's opinions, so I wasted seven bucks for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be printed off a cliff. Since when did scary movies have juicy scenes? I swear I was amazed there were no GROUP of HUG ^ moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I've zoned and thought of my English research paper. The clich√©d, bird / cat that comes out of nowhere when you think something, is going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost baptized when the alarm went off and the main character said, "I need my mother's shawl !!!" You. Idiot. Screw the scarf! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mother's shawl (which doesn't fit the dress) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And on top of all, they take her back to her home, knowing the killer knows where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not only the, I bet, he sticks under the bed, moments. That was the one, "He stole the clothes class's clothes and crept out of the hotel" and "It's the detective coming in, not the murderer!" moments. Movies should never be predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to finish my rant by saying, this was a terrible movie. I'm glad I saw it in theaters, so I won't buy it for $ 15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If the killer was shot by the detective after the shooting, he would have fallen into the same position he shot. Knife in hand, falling and jutting down the girl on his way. Oh, how lovely it would have been. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
