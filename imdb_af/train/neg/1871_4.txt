In spite of the cute production numbers and wonderful costumes, this film is a piece to watch. The murder mystery plot is just a vehicle to store the musical numbers, but it often brings the proceedings to an astonishing silence, except that it does not involve much. Although much money was spent on them, the numbers were badly hit and poorly photographed. This is, of course, a pre-code movie because the girls often wear very small clothes and there is even a song that praises marijuana praise! The performances are all one note, although it is nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but as Victor McLaglen, as the police lieutenant, faces for the umpteenth time in search of clues, you may want to throw the towel or at least forward to the next number. Sorry the customers caught in the movie are already free!
