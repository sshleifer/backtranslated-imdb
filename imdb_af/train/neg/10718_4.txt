Come on Tina Fey, you can do better than that. Once the movie started, I knew how it would end. Sure, it was sometimes funny. Even laughing out loud. But it's not enough to save this movie. I do not recommend buying it. Most of the time I recommend renting it, but that's all. Baby Mama has some funny scenes, but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming end it strives for. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a great team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both succeeded and they are doing well in it. But that's not the best. Baby Mama played a good supporting role. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the cast. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy film hit the biosphere. After the big Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average in comparison. Coupled and Juno is Hilarious, Heartwarming and has ends that leave you with a smile on your face. Baby Mama's end was indecent and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it didn't try. I recommend it, but don't expect it to be completely hilarious. Expect an average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional end to it. I give Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
