It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible. Whether you are light or any ship or not is irrelevant. As for special effects, the film has nothing. The entire film crew was probably out on the boat in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men were "stabbed" (even if you could call it), their reactions were totally unreal. The guns are more quiet than a dumb. How this film can have one or two awards, raises serious questions about the state of human mind. Well, that's about it. This review is probably better to read than the movie is going to watch. If anyone is considering buying it or buying it, I would highly recommend it for clear reasons. I said it included a spoiler. If some people are stabbed and a gun fired, this is a plot. I think it's because they are the only good parts of the movie.
