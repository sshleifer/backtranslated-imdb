OK, it has 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie I've ever had to watch. Like all other Olsen twin movies with the possible exception of New York minute, this movie has no story, gaping plot holes, disgustingly acting and bad filming even !!!!!!!!! if you do not guess, I HAVE MARY KATE AND ASLEY !!!!!! The only reason I looked at it was because I was very bored and nothing else. I wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical films where they have an incredible silly adventure in an exotic place and get the help of two cute guys who fall over immediately. The least they could be to have a man 4 1 of them, or to fall both of them 4 the same man. The plot in this story was so uncomfortable and just stupid. even a toddler can see the mistakes in it. Perhaps they should split up and start making movies individually or maybe movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who likes this movie was no offense, either really stupid, really artificial or didn't see a very good movie. Or maybe they are really smart and they only have bad movies. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience. The only thing is good. 4 It's a little rib that shaves on the pathetic efforts to be cool. If you look for laughter, it's hilarious. basically I give it 0 or less.
