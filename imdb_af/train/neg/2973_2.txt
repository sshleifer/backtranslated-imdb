I have two very important complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local rental store was located, which is clearly a soft core porn in the "tension" category. (If I knew what it was, I wouldn't have rented my time in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with do movie. No one in this movie does something that is deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two. <br /> <br /> It actually makes three big complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. For some reason I watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list. Son, I'm sorry. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This movie is worthless at almost every level.
