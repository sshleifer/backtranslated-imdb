This movie was physically painful to go through, perhaps because I (as many people my age and younger) grew up with dr. Seuss and his books loved - simultaneously, clever, whimsical and subversive. "The cat in the hat" sucks all the interest and spark from the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the cat is mostly confusing. Why accentuate that Borscht Belt, the unique patter, that unsuitable joke, that charmless costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are simple. This movie is overwhelmed and far too much. <br /> <br /> You don't expect every kid movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this one sets a new low. How can Mike Myers need the money?
