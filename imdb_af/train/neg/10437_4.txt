Admirably strange but stunned comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts cracking early from the weight. Some of the cinematography is tempting, Shelley Duvall is a sting in her debut as a tour guide. Sally Kellerman sees every inch of the globe as Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (think of Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining the role to her!). In the lead, Bud Cort is - again, "Harold & Maude" - a true original; Not like Michael J. Pollard, Cort, like a man, geeky, wacky and inoffensive, a difficult act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's misfires. He can assemble a saucepan and an object like no one else, but let him down with some wrong inspiration and spiral downwards. ** of ****
