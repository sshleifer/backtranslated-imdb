I have read several good reviews that defend and criticize the different aspects of this film. One thing I see over and over is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I'm a 23-year-old political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I'm connected to Megan. Besides, she's cute. She's not a supermodel, but more of a cute girl next door. <br /> <br /> OK, so she cried and yelled. It's very dramatic and looks exaggerated, but doesn't it fit her character? She goes on that show for the purpose of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think she made her argument very good. Of course, as a young na√Øve girl, she is afraid of what she stands for. I think her acting depicts a young girl showing a moral courage, despite her overwhelming fear. Furthermore, I think she retained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in. <br /> <br /> What the movie in general, except Megan, was pretty much what I expected. It has excellent gore scenes, according to micro-budget standards. The plot might have had a quick thought, hardly any consideration. It's basically just a dark humorous senseless slasher movie, which implies the name. I love the doctor's sadism. He slipped Megan's shirt, not just for the cause of sleaze (though largely so), but also to torment her before killing her. The chainsaw hick was hilarious. For treasure lovers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10. It had a good environment, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for a cheap excitement, but almost a rough diamond that is micro budgetary.
