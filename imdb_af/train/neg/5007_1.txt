There is no reason to see this movie. A good plot idea is treated very badly. In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there, nothing makes sense. The reason for the murder was not made clear. The acting is terrible. Needless to say, Nick Stahl needs a better director. He was excellent in In the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy has to change her character one day. Even those of you who enjoy free sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this one), there are no deleted scenes in the DVD, which means they never bothered to put the missing parts into the characters to fill. /> <br /> Don't spend the time on this one.
