As an impressive 10-year-old, I love the "love-winning" philosophy of the 70's sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie." I understood the controversy about the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents who have problems with the couple's marriage to marriage. <br /> <br /> Watching the show now with years of personal life experiences, I'm surprised the show was even a success for one, though, highly rated season. Made by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who would write the successful play "same time next year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" a few years after the cancellation, was a very light superficial comedy under his own airweight in case. br /> There was no denial of the actual chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in later years both actors showed that they were better actors in other projects (Birney in his brief role in "St Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they tried to blow life into a show that needed a very sharp comic edge, which could give the complications more depth to a very controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The show broadcast between two CBS power stations on Saturday nights. : "All in Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were clever, funny, and full of edge (more so on the former and the latter) who kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very clever and had just a few visits. <br /> <br /> It was another example of a show that wasn't really as good as I remembered.
