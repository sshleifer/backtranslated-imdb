Not as bad as you heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is attractive and fun as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are completely professional. They are pretty good at just about anything. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday movie you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. The attempts at dark humor come out like dour. Affleck tries hard to be spastic and over-enthusiastic, but comes across as disturbed. His character's cartoon-like nature is brought to light when viewed by Gandolfini and O'Hara's more subdued, credible actions. Even through the relaxed standards of holiday flies, you never buy in the full set of Affleck to rent this family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that surround the surrealism in their strangeness. The X-mas-like scene is full of bloody humor (a boy is discovered to look at naked, challenging pictures of his mother), which is not only funny or credible, but also disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, almost noirish. The home most of the movie looks remarkable and inexpensive. <br /> <br /> "Survivor" is mostly of interest as the fourth in a series of boxing duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and so on) for Affleck. It still has to be seen how expensive the damage will be.
