Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi channel (although I think it's now Syfy?) Original movie I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two others since, and I can tell you they were stupid, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is poorly done, the acting is bad, the writing is ridiculous, and what happens in the end is unexpected and out of place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I didn't want to place a spoiler in my review). Plus, there was this one musical song used in each and every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they just played it over and over. And it's definitely not original; I know I've heard somewhere before (I just can't remember where). This is one to avoid.
