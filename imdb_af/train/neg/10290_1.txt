I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I watched parts and it was just too stupid to see again. The excessive amount of watery 'blood' at the beginning is just unfinished - not to mention the wind sounds of the wind. My friends and I made a super low budget movie, and the effects have still exceeded this crap. <br /> <br /> Regarding the amount of errors in this movie, there is too much to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my TEATER teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Do not save with this "horror" flick. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of a possible 73)
