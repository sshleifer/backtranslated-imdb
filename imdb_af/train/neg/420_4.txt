For those who want to see this movie? I'll say, go! Without the narrative it could be a very good movie / documentary. But the music, the narrative and some of the implemented story lines make it very difficult to look for a skeptical person like me. After several animals, they experience life in several seasons that it is an animal soap we look at. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, and if a predator finally catches a prey (one exception to the left), the camera taps or jumps to another scene. I ask myself why this happens, if they have to show reality, why do the scenes cut a melodramatic fairy tale? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, for after all: it will be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
