The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical journey of 1950's. The special effects are pretty cheap, the moon robbers are apparently oversized jeeps of World War II with painted plywood over them, and so on. The acting is just like that. It inspires the imagination of children, to whom I believe it is directed. Against today's standards it is boring, cheap and bad. There is also a great deal of stock in the first 9 natural disaster episodes.
