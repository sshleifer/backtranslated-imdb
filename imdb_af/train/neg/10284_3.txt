After seeing men behind the sun, I was hoping for an evolution in style and technique to fit the larger scale of this movie. I was also very interested to see someone making a stubborn fact-based fictional version of what happened during this most infamous Japanese atrocity, but that's not the case. It plays like a European Nazi exploitation competition from the seventies - e.g. SS Experiment Camp etc. (maybe more like Deported Women of the Special Section). Admittedly, it has a wider range and more people are running around, but it goes over to the same cheap and fearless device of many fearless non-actors who switch to the sound of ridiculous false gunshot wounds, crawled with the occasionally poorly performed 'shock' drive. The extremely spectacular documentary footage is split roughly between the screens, and even these actual images are robbed of many of their power. Watch channel 4's "The Holocaust" (recently downloaded (still running?), From 1 No 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary about the ills of war (with excellent in-context use of real-world footage). This is the kind of treatment that the Nanjing abomination deserves, not this chopped exploitation coffee (a better-performing mining film minus the irreverent use of stock image material would have been good, but it's not even a very good exploitation cookie). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment of the subject).
