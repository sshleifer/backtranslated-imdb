** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce. <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Ms Keaton enough, with your Annie Hall philosophy and guard. <br /> <br /> This movie is just too much like Keaton's daughter, Sarah, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who couldn't even be reached telephonically while she was in the bag with her partner and the telephone plug, was grabbing a grievous new way. <br /> <br /> She returns to the summer room where all Sara's friends live. She cleans the house, sleeps two days, and then begins to reveal things that were better not to be revealed. It looks like sweet Sara slept with her friend and the guy who eventually married the latter. In addition, she had an abortion to this man. We are all on this debt trip now. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find the elusive diary Sarah kept. She also hopes that the boyfriend, Adam, who is a playwright, will not include it in another play. <br /> <br /> When the diary is found, it is written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D in this language. It's not such a good news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a Japanese cook into a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course everything looks fine in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sara would talk, they would both say Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that wasn't enough, Keaton tells us in the course of this weird reckless raw Adam that he's not another Woody Allen. In his film, Interiors, where he tried to emulate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Me. Keaton is also trying drugs with the group. Let us, people, can we realistically believe that anyone in his own mind can grieve so? <br /> <br /> Fair to moderate, best sum up this movie.
