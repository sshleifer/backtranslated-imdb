Jean Luc Godard's Marxist controversy is so close to a film that is not available, as you will probably see an internationally respected film maker. Bits from the political theater, annoyingly boring and unmistakable, are interwoven with making "The Devil's Sympathy", with the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of the song's development, of Mick Jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar, to the end-recorded backing vocals is fascinating, and it is worthwhile to watch this movie. rent only to see the bits with the Stones. Almost half of the film was devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapters, you can hit all the bizarre political sketches and just watch the Stones bring a song along. <br /> <br /> When I had it on laser disk, I tried bravely to see it all, but I don't see how anyone can get it. I finally gave up and just skipped chapter - skipped my way to the Stones segments.
