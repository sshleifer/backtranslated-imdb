You are devastated and beaten by my hard statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" movies! Now another race comes in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movies! Many of these I've seen before, and let me tell you, they're not all that cracked! They usually are not on the point. This, among all others, suffers from no originality! What does a ninja have to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And isn't it supposed to be a "martial arts" movie too? Do many firearms sound like an amazing action movie for you? Is blood the number one reason to love it to death? Will you rub some of your hard-earned cash over a lady singing in her transparent tank finger? The answers to these important questions are found in the NINJA MISSION, which must be in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more nonsense ninja fun, try to check out the Godfrey Ho movies from Trans World. You get what you deserve, and that's a promise! Recommended for hardcore ninja addicts only!
