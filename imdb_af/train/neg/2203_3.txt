Note all mad scientists everywhere: if you want to change your son into a genetically mutated monster, give him a scarcer name than "Paul." I don't care if he's a terrifying hammerhead shark, with a mouth full of dagger teeth and the ability to hinder people in the water as well as on dry ground. Give the child a more worthy name such as, "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon." Because even if he was putting me up, I would probably just sit there and laugh, "Ha! Get a load of this! Paul the Monster rips me to blink !!!!!" This is the worst part of this movie, this shark thing is referred to in the whole flick as "Paul". That makes what a decent, frightening horror movie could be, just stupid. Not that there are no other camps and faced parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." The scientists spend the whole movie wandering along this island and suddenly one of the girls with a mad delusion starts walking into the lush forest and just throwing water on her feet to revive the itching, which of course "allows Paul" get out of the water and kill her. The one thing SciFI Channel was right in this movie was the hottie life. But it's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie.
