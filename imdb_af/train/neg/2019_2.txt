Oh man, it sucked. I couldn't even get a camp value from this ... and I put the whole thing on the showtime. Don't bother waiting for the 'bare screens either ..... it's too late and only plastic Jenna Jameson is involved. Show how much discretionary cash to Hollywood should be to just get your name on the final credits. I think Showtime had to throw something at 01:00 ... The next time I think I'll even watch ESPN every 30 minutes.
