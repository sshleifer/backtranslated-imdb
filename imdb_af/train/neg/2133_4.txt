First things first: I'm not conservative. And even if I never referred to myself as liberal or democratic, I was on the first day of the war in Iraq. I think it's safe to say John Cusack and I'll probably see politics. In fact, I'm sure we'll be drinking friends if we ever have to talk about how big Adam Curtis's BBC documents are. My point is this: don't discredit this review by thinking I'm not part of the choir. Cusack sermon in War, Inc. There is no doubt. WI's policy has been adapted to address my demographic profession, but the problem is that the dressing room is substandard and the film Cusack co-authored, produced and starred, is worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say, "The road to hell is intentional." Cusack, his co-authors, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors concerned undoubtedly had every intention of biting and making an anti-war film every time, like Robert Altman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one so indifferently and relentlessly as Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of American politics, foreign policy and war "effort" is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, pathetic and unhappy comics - just look at The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is: you can't write stuff as funny as the Bush administration provides us daily, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with WI is that it feels like it is in a hurry. To get it right, Cusack basically changed the cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films) into a shopping list of ideas recorded by Naomi Klein's collected works. Most of these ideas are tied into your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film. What makes them so keen is not one of the jokes or gags or deliberate references to Halliburton, the Neo-Cons and the American occupation of Iraq, is imaginative. , smart or funny. The authors are so blinded by their own dogma that they felt that the movie would only be funny and subversive. The problem is ... it's not. By now, these ideas are yesterday's news and unless you live under or in the rock or are blinded by ignorance, denial, and sheer stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), jokes are simple, jokes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps WI will work if it is nuanced, subversive, offensive and filled with detailed research / insight into the profession. As it is, the jokes and siggats are all superficial and so bad, with so little finesse, subtle or satirical evil, they have done little to make me groan. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny because it's true" and the Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc. However, prove that just because it's true doesn't make it funny. The bottom line: hyperbola is not necessary when it comes to lampooning US / Neo-conservative politics. It's already a big enough joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
