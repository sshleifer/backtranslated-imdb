It was really so bad. Like the (merciful!) Short-lived "Dirty Dozen" TV series Ben Murphy played and made at the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was ashamed. for the role-players of this film - and especially for Telly Savalas. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (hit 70 when he made this garbage) and the reviewer who made parallels with Telly's Greek in this and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" counted it pretty much. <Br /> <br /> Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughing criminals who have this celluloid crime, so I will not repeat them here. But I would add that I am surprised that no one still has the ridiculous little helmet that Savalas wears on his large, inflated head. <br /> <br /> I'm also amazed that this train wreck of a movie is as high as 4.7 here at IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a 1 "across the board. If you want a good example of why a franchise is dead, it's really a bad idea (especially 20 plus years) to the original) Look no further than the Dirty Dozen - The Fateful Mission. <br /> <br /> Terrible - Avoid !!!!
