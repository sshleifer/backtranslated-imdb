It's just because it's David Hasselhoff stars. Well, let me bash it. Compared to the garbage they call today is horror, this movie doesn't come too bad. It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but can't speak very well. There is a big scene with her when she is raped supernaturally. She showed off her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff. 10/03
