Let's see ... I try to practice finding the positive in everything, so what kind of thing can I say about the Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, it won't work, as they managed to drain all the personality of Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so alive, and eventually caricatures from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey created. <br /> <br /> How's the story going? No. It won't fly either, because it was dead. What was the genre anyway? It wasn't funny, it made comedy. It wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask because I can't be sure - let's just call it "losers in like." I'm sure those behind this movie start with a vision, I mean, they had to have one to fit on the studio package, but I need help finding it. <br /> <br /> Even though I was a patient who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, I couldn't recommend a movie with good conscience that a man in a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy , fluffy, silly hair can do. Speaking of hair - should we be entertained by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks that Hershey wore? <br /> <br /> What do I do? I've lost 97 irreparable minutes in real-time movie watching - I can't spend more time on this loser.
