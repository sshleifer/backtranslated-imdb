One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get my money back from Hollywood Video". It's not worth appreciating four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to snatch the Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies, but it failed to do so. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I was sorry for the actors they couldn't find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We made the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was abusively exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
