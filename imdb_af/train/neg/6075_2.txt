One of the worst movies I've ever seen at Robert De Niro, The Fan is a senseless clich√© of an exercise in bracts. It tries to turn or distort the genre with a turbulent plot lines of a mad fan who has become psychotic. (spoiler) We believe that a jerky idiot has access to and murder a baseball player in a luxury hotel without witness, security or cameras? The movie is nonsense that tries to drag our passion through the hoopla of baseball which is suddenly unsophisticated and clumsy. Not sure what all the actors thought when they got on board. It's as big as they come. Stay far away if you prefer in your movies
