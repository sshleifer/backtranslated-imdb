1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Bizarre story of a failed witch trying to catch eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think it was the relationship. A kind of terrible quality is being held throughout this movie, no different from Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was camp in Nicholson's show which is not in this movie at all. All this is taken very seriously until the end when some lame-one liners and efforts to relieve the mood do not work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything doesn't look very smooth, and the viewer is left with many pieces of information and no real understanding of what has happened in the movie. There is a very small throw away performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter, who of course gives him top billing in an attempt to sell the film. Don't buy in this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
