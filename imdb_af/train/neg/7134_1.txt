So it came here. Fast, expensive cars that will only manage the top 1% ever. The girls sitting next to them in gearhead pages. Second Level and name actors. Cheap promotional shows by people of non-culture. <br /> <br /> It's the rubbish Hollywood has to offer. Do not misunderstand me; I love the incessant action movie with hot chicks as much as the next man. But please, the collective Brain trust that emphasizes these things, please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah", then turn back twenty years and remember what once made it enjoyable. Do you actually make such movies again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole pop culture blast that has enjoyed the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother think their Maverick now (not half of them will even get the referral). Some executives said, "Hey, what demographic do you want to leak $ 9.50?" "I know, sir. The 18-35 mark." "Okay, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Brilliant idea, sir." The result? A movie that I watched Spike TV a hundred times late at night, and more often than not, with Dolph Lundgren starring. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me now, I'm not a snob. Over-the-top artsy flicks like The English Patient don't drive my boat, but generic movies that don't even have to be straightened up, make DVD of hell as well. Only adolescent levers will revive their engines, and I think those in the higher part of their IQ series will see it for what it is: a junkyard.
