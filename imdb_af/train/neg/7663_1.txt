Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... Well, this is STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ! Personally, I would like to thank the brilliant decisive directors for the hard work and effort. You are up. Here's an idea, just my humble humble opinion as the movie audience goes, but it follows directly with your previous choices, a movie about the most brilliant neurophysician in history, designing one pill to all the diseases ever known to man is to cure and get it, heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you would like it. Although you owe me $ 7.50.
