My girlfriend and I were amazed at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes we would have mentioned that it stopped, except that we were too curious to see if the movie itself could leave. It didn't. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the praise given to this movie. The writing was really awful and delivered by some of the worst observations I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly bothered me about this movie was that it was often when people talked to each other that an unnatural break between lines. I understand the use of a break to create a feeling of discomfort (as in Luck). It wasn't such a break - it was just bad direction. This movie can actually be much better with subtitles, and perhaps the overseas market is best for this movie, because then the intense dialogue and bad acting will not be noticed so much. <br /> <br /> I usually like These kind of small, strange movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this one has failed at as many levels as I see it as one of the worst movies I've been sitting for the past few years.
