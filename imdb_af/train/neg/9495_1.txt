It's a terrible movie, and not one scene has our true emotion. The characters are irreplaceable, obviously drawn, predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillment. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made, but he plays someone in his early 40's and looks like he's in his 60's. Kay Lenz was 20 and was written to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found along the way was more sexy and more alive than their erotic connection. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this movie, coincidentally - is placed with obvious bumps of 60's pre-hippie cool: the bachelor road, the swing hi-fi lunch at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously uncool, a bunch of old fogs who desperately want the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon to find them and their big honkin's cars. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture was never so desperate. And I'm scared to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youth that he took this painful part.
