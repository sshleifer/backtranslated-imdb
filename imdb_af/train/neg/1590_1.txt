HAH! So this is the movie that comes in the "Next Action Stars". Well, I'm glad I didn't participate and didn't win. <br /> <br /> It's not funny how to look after the first 10 seconds! about a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at those titles! I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" as it was made for TV and we couldn't see the whole thing). One night while doing my military service and the audience with me, the typical hodge podge of average guys who once looked like Las Vegas was just for the girls in the show. so the bar wasn't really high, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and it wasn't because of the big writing. D. But the movie's total lack of originality, acting, essay and just about everything else that makes a movie good, has made it easy to change the channel to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group, and that is rare! this movie is not! If it is on TV, yes, watch it and think about it. My conclusion Well, since Joel Silver did indeed make some of the best action movies there (Die Hard, Matrix 1, for some I can only say that producers don't give the movie, it's quality, they give money to the directors, and to sell this movie just because it is a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to the obvious flaws of the crew that made it really.
