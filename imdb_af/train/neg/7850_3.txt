Alexandre Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the brightest places of 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror movie, but it was also damn good. So, almost a year later, we are treated to the successor of the remake. While original Crackback West Craven is back as producer and co-script, this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military pupils stop in the desert to go in to some scientists and find themselves the first movie (at least those who stay, plus newcomers). There are plenty of gore to be here. What annoys me about this movie is the total lack of characterization. The viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people, because we have not succeeded. Even the mutants had some characterization and that time, nothing. Gore for the sake of gore is useless. There should be a reason why it will be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what about rape scenes in movies lately? Here we get another one for no real reason. Hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again.
