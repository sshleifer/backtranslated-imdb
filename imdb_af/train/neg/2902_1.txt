Spoiler: Forest passive-aggressive people with family reunification. The writing has them saying and doing things people will never do, at least someone with a fine sound. The hero falls to a woman he sees as a soul mate at a bookstore on the day of the reunion, unaware that she will appear on the reunion as his brother's friend. He tries to postpone his brother's claim, but she knows that our hero is clearly in her raid, immersing him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper. He rubs over the brother in a terrible excuse that she shows him how to stretch. At one point she actually deprives and goes with him in the shower. He tried to cover his eyes. His heart breaks. She thinks it's funny until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really does. The audience coughed and fed the long distance. The writing is insignificant and incredible. We almost walked out, but thought something would happen to things, but no. All the wonderful reviews should be written by paid scales, to see poor suckers like me in such crap. Compare it to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, the authors, the actors, the producers and the theaters to make something bad, make it on the screen!
