Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, that didn't reach the goal. The historic subject of giants is a good one, but throws in the gum and you end up with a huge wheel of cheese. I say, take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff. I couldn't even watch the whole movie. It says a lot, because I rarely walk away from any movie. I always like to give them a chance for the last minute salvation. It is impossible to solve something so bad. Well, at least the acting was good .... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing "falling" in this movie is the rating. 1/10 and sink in the negative numbers!
