I found this movie quite strange. From the beginning I found it extremely difficult to keep this movie, and now I can reason why I almost copied it. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made), is very much overlooked here, and although I can't fix my life better, I'm sure someone could have taken his place fairly easily and worked this movie. All the rest are good, except for the boots at a poor comedy. (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as the British Major. It only suffers from one thing. Jean-Marc.
