This movie doesn't make sense, there are plot holes that are big enough to drive huge NYPD vehicles. The characters do not act in any credible way. I'll post my comments in the chatboard, but save your time and money, it's stupid. I can't stand if Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash switch gear and use fancy editing and cool music, and don't bother even a plot that even coincides with the most basic level. But it is nice to see Denzel W. win over the Man, in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. Von Trapp comes. There is even a lovely little child with a nice video game.
