The people who praise this movie are the real disappointments. I still hope that Leonard will see some good $$ from this as his lifesaving a few years ago was astonished by a driver and he is now over 70. But this movie is just awful. In the beginning, Leonard himself says that he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next one and a half years the film highlights all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It's so bloody APPEARANCE with its endless close-ups of emotional singers. Cohen's interview was all done in lo-fi video simulations and so I wanted to see a medium or long shot of his entire body! I couldn't care less about the comments of the artists, especially the remaining ego boys Edge and Bono. Not one of the artists in this movie has even made one song as good as Leonard's own music, and if you are considering seeing it and you are in doubt, consider it. It will be an acceptable PBS specialist, perhaps, for a one-off show. But I would even hesitate to get a DVD of this. When the movie finally shows Leonard's semi-performing "Tower of Song", it is destroyed by taking Bono a verse. Even occasionally good performances (Antony, Rufus's first number, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of these turgid blabla. Forget this one and buy Leonard's most recent album if you pay tribute to him.
