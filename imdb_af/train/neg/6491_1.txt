This movie was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with a group of movie lovers, who had a variety of movies in movies, but always a keen eye for a work of genius (as one of my co-comments on this site had the gall to call this bumpy pole ??); None of them found a single quality. We ended the movie with an exciting choir of scouts. I won't reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Now that one of the judges will tell you, has he financed the film himself? Because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world would risk a single penny or their good name about this movie. Don't let the semi-famous actors appearing in the movie lure you into his clutches? as Christian Slater acknowledges in the special features "make", he subscribed to the movie without reading the script or knowing any details (foolishness I am sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the unfortunate Individual who stumbles into this malice of self-confidence written, directed, manufactured and funded by a man who is too familiar to admit he is not everything he creates , a masterpiece (and if you don't believe me, google Anthony Hopkins and art).
