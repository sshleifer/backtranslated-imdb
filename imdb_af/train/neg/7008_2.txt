Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really upset about someone stealing the Corvette, he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (possibly the ugliest car in a movie), and joins Las Vegas with Annie trace the evil genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have plucked my eyes after watching it or not for the pleasure of watching Annie Potts in a very early role, and that too is bad for Hamill that he doesn't some plays from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo.
