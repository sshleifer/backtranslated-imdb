A horrible movie with a crowd of D-list Canadian actors who are so self-conscious about being on the camera that their performances are too melodramatic and fairly obsolete. <br /> <br /> This film was badly written, poorly edited and badly targeted. It is unpleasant, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a good job with what he is given, but is the only one in this movie to do it - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It's not even camp enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> I still saw Van Pelleske's actions in a credible way, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, shining voice) confirm that we are in Toronto rather than on " a boat from Africa. <br /> <br /> Didn't the director see the "creature" look like a jazz dancer in a stranger? The battle between blue lightning and Pelleske's orange whistles of 'magic' is, of course, the result of bad actors, without choreographer, with complete derivative special effects. Was there even a director on the set or in the room for processing this disaster movie (not the good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret as I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
