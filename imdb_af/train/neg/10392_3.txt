I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis, because you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot. I saw several adjudicators, call an 'anti-rape' movie or even a feminist statement, and I just have to start with the rudeness of these claims. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a pretty woman is behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make a rape statement - and I absolutely do not believe it - is quite a point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything except actual penetration is shown) that no one but the hard core exploitation food will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The rape (s) in the movie are uncomfortable, brutal and difficult to watch. There is something to be said for presenting a terrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to look for apparently 30 minutes. There was also a small character development of the victim and only one of the rapists was slightly developed (mere moments before being murdered), so that the scene was not at an emotional level. Really, it is only offered to display extremely sexual violence, and you can tell it through the films associated with ISOYG with IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.). It only attracts the exploit. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers praised Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of soundtrack. But considering how clumsy everything else is in the film (acting, scripting, etc.) I suspect it was financial decisions and the movie looks like a documentary because he literally had a camera stationed and his porno actors do their thing. /> <br /> I'm not going to get everything on my high horse and talk about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I only give this movie three stars because it pushes the envelope so much further than some other movies. However, it was also bad and after the rape took place, it was just boring for the rest of the movie as we watched a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders waiting for the credits to roll. <br /> <br /> It is probably worth checking out once if you are a hardcore 70 exploitation fan, but I tell you, the movie is generally pretty bad and not really the infamous reputation.
