OK, here it is: "Nazi climber is friends with the Dalai Lama." What we do is to first get a big star, with no idea how to do a Germanic accent, and let us move between French, German, American and Britain in two hours. Then we confronted a series of unlikely events and spread them apart so that the plot was almost imperceptible. But just to make sure the viewer doesn't fall asleep, throw in our details that are shockingly absurd, like our hero who smokes a cigarette at a height of 22,000 feet. Of course, we should also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowest farmer in the forbidden, closed city Lhasa in 1943, perfect English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the hardest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story. So what we do is that we've befriended the Dalai Lama with the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other device that represents the freedom of the capitalist west. In return, our hero from his young protest teaches a kind of vague, undefined Buddhism that is never really dealt with or treated in any serious way. We also have many scenes with the hero who weaken all the points of respect and protocol, acknowledging the rest of Tibetan society to the Dalai Lama, even if we pretend that the hero has deep and profound respect for these people and their spiritual leader . In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is a Buddhist type, in his own way, even if we don't see what his transformation is or how far we want it. And last but not least, we have a statistic at the end of the film about how shocking the Chinese have been to the Tibetans (which is certainly true), opening us up to charges of making a "political" film, although is nothing of the kind. So, I'm my idea. Do you sink? Can you make ZIS movie?
