A lot of kids set up a theater to have an everyday horror movie marathon. But as night goes on, there is someone among them who kills one by one. Who is this ... and why? I saw it on a theater road in 1991. I'm looking forward to it - but boy! It didn't work at all. The premise is a good one, they have a very nice young cast and some benefits like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it doesn't work. The story ceases to be half-confused (this may be due to some great editing before the movie is released). The murders are relatively bloodless (how it has an R-score is beyond me) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - this movie has potential. With a better writing it could have become a big horror movie. As it stands, it's mostly forgotten and the scroll itself seems embarrassed (I heard Stone won't talk about this one). I give it a 3 and it's just for the cast.
