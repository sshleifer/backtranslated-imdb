Okay, I remember watching the first one, and the boy sucked it. After watching it, I just laughed and said to myself, "Oh boy, just another low budget B movie. I will never see part 2 for this one." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, part two came. It sucked even more. But I just laughed it again and said, "I'll never see part 3 for this one." Then, about 1/2 a year later, Part 3 came out. I was stupid enough to rent it and son, I just broke down after watching it. God, I never really realized how many movies these days can suck. Save yourself $ 7.50 and don't rent the whole range. Trust me, this is worth every penny.
