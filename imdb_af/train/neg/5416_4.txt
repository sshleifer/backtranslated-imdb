This was the third attempt of director von Stroheim - it is rather rough and does not show any of the exceptional flair for the camera and he appeared with his masterpieces GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH a few years later. In essence, we have a trio of greats, masquerading as a Russian score and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use money at the gaming tables and win a fortune. Part of the plan is for the Count (von Stroheim) to wipe himself between a visiting US ambassador and his "foolish" wife, to welcome her and hope to earn money by playing on her weaknesses. He made the mistake of also taking the lifesaving of the maid, which he promised to marry. When she sees them together, she lights up the room (von Stroheim and his prey is in the room's balcony). Here, von Stroheim establishes his person as "the man you love to hate." He is very bad and his character errors eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is rough in its movies and editing and is not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director. There's a nice little bit. When he first tried to meet the ambassador's wife, she read a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. It was originally proposed as a 210-minute movie, cut to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released 70 minutes. The recovery on Kino Video restores the surviving footage (somehow damaged in most scenes) of the alternative previous version to give us a 107-minute print.
