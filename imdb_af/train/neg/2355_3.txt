I was almost against the inclusion of songs in a movie. My belief was that the quality of the movie would be automatically improved if only those extremely annoying songs were being tracked. But things changed quickly after seeing that horrible Black (no songs) and this movie (many songs). While Swart was weak to the extreme, it delivered a gripping story with some strong acting and good direction. The songs were almost coincidental and mixed in almost seamlessly with the film. There was definitely not a woman who sprayed with water, without a clear reason for mysterious water resources, while bumping into streets in the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised with the brave and petty approach the director used. . There was nothing about anything, and almost every scene was completely credible. <br /> <br /> I would recommend these movies to Hindi-speaking people with at least a slight understanding of Mumbai life. The former because the English subtitles were substandard and contained many errors, which sometimes completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter because you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of the image once you have lived it yourself. <br /> <br /> I would certainly appreciate it as a work that deserves international recognition. The scenes with the gossip were a good touch and it served as a source of real humor as well as a different perspective on the whole mishmash. However, the film falls short in a few places, where the characters sometimes say the inexplicable things that detract from the overall direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought some of the sad scenes didn't do very well. It was a touch of amusing to watch, rather than arousing any feelings of sadness, and the whole scene tended to come across as a bit of a fool. However, these are minor issues, because the film is actually a rare treat to watch. <br /> Overall, it's a cynical, pessimistic look and a refreshing one! Actors, not 'heroes' - this is the key. A chance to see credible people in an extraordinary environment - everyday life. A behind-the-scenes look at the extent of depravity and a rare ray of hope for the Indian theater. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
