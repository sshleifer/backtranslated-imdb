Hands off the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would ever unleash the Last Action Hero, but it does it easily. The movie is about 3 single men who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades this weekend. A fourth guy - who is married and - was previously part of the group and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughing. Avoid at all costs.
