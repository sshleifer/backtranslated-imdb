Want to watch a scary horror movie? Then hide from this one. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough shot. Single error, if you can manage it. <br /> <br /> If previous comments were not enough to prevent you from watching this movie, I have to help. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A very big sunburn causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go down from there, and wackiness occurs. <br /> <br /> I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the movie, and the book was terrible. There are at least a couple of previews facing, and an explanation of the events is drawn from the writers' rhymes. <br /> <br /> Not to say the movie is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really had to read a contract before signing a movie, and Jonathan Demme found that he was really better suited to register. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an MST3K episode with this movie, but this is of course reasonably edited. Without the mandatory flash of the breasts, even the healing power of the shot cannot save you. <br /> <br /> Please see Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to melt a man. See Space Cowboys if you need to see astronauts. I can't recommend this movie to the sober film public in all good conscience.
