Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of Wild West troops, one of six regular misfits consisting of a struggling-to-break-even tournament. The seventh member of the cluster is a woman, Billy's assistant, but such women never last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke ?? Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, seems to be a serious heir who only died of her father's estate if she was married by the time she was 30, so on the eve of that birthday she was crushed . after the cartoon Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what is the plot of this movie? It's hard to say. There is the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the film she is so hauntily insipid and horrible that when she suddenly becomes "one of the troops" halfway through the movie, it's not just incredible is not, but the audience is well over taking care of her. There is the chronic shortage of funds behind the Wild West Show, but this topic is not enough to really be the raison d'etre of the movie. There is Miss Lilly's trouble getting stranded in the rural west, cut off from the funds that burn her luxurious life (she mistakenly believed she was dead by her family and the press). But are we really supposed to believe she couldn't come back to New York and her welfare if she did a bit of trouble? <br /> <br /> No, the point of this movie is that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovely bunch of losers who are thick and thin. This is a hot, fuzzy movie ?? or at least try to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even a bank robbery in a shooting that is largely out of place in an otherwise relatively non-violent movie. One of the gangs is being arrested on an old evasion charge; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The tent's tent burned down; An orphanage makes them a new one. But many everyday pitfalls do not make a plotmaker. <br /> <br /> The composition of the problem is the acting or lack thereof. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateurish. Eastwood is also not on top of his game, even though it looks better just because of such a dumb bunch. <br /> <br /> And for all this, the movie goes on for 116 minutes. To what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
