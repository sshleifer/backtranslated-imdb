I have Crispin Glover's "What is it?" Saw. at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. The film is at least appropriate, because I have the clear sense that even the author / director could not answer. When questioned and answered session after the show, Mr Glover said the film was originally intended to be a short film to show the virtues of using actors with the syndrome. However, it is not enough in itself to create a movie. Actors are, in my opinion, building blocks for a bigger vision - a bigger vision that was at best shaky and absent. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to address taboo subjects. Well, he does. But why? The film seems to have no attitude, no reason to address it. Does he think these things shouldn't be taboo? The movie doesn't even give me an indication of it. Taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting. It can't even afford to disturb or encourage the taboo at any level, because he didn't care for the audience in any way. <br /> <br /> Negative problem with the concept for a moment, the thing that shocked me the most was how poor the movie was. The editing, cinematography and other technical aspects were often extremely amateur. Glover said 125-150 thousand dollars went into the film, and I felt that the money had to be spent on different designers. Glover actually designed it - I know I at least saw good design in the credits. The painted sets are okay (not large) but are poorly used. Parts feel like a photographed stage play - it will be good if it goes for any kind of goal, but in Glover's hands it just feels messy. Other parts are filmed like a Home Movie, of inferior quality to many of the things I see for the first time, create iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is with "What is it?" I can't even understand how serious the movie should be. There are a few parts that feel that Glover is screaming to think seriously. At other points, he looks like his own little joke. Maybe he meant that it was ironic or meaningful, but I just felt that Glover couldn't even get him to give his film any serious attention. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted this to be a short movie. If only it was. In twenty-seventy minutes, the film runs out of imagery and ideas within the first twenty. It is advisable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there.
