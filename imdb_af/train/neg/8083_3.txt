It's denied by Richard C. Sarafian. This disaster occurred Japanese theaters before they came to the States and immediately went to the video, where it was not seen again, until the Turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3 am 6am slots. adhesive tape at the bottom of their bowl. The Smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hooks the film so badly that the director no longer wants his name on it. But I'm afraid Sarafians can't blame the studio on this one. The actors, mostly recent graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one grind to another. The plot is complicated. The special effects are unimportant. The parts that are not leaking are just boring. The script or book should have been good - why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston appear otherwise in this dud? But something went awfully wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad - it's good.
