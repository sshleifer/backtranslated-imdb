This movie masquerades as a social commentary, when it is just as ridiculous as the racism that condemns it. The premise of this movie: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun at Omar Epps and a Jewish man. The Jewish man, in a stereotypical way, cries in fear and begins to plead for his life ... but the great, strong, challenging Omar Epps stand strong without fear. We also drank or raped the condemnation of every brother member as an arrogant slander. Of course, the raped white girl starts with lesbians, as she is just a poor white girl. Of course, when the nerdy white man is rejected by the brotherhood, he must fall with the skinheads, which are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular man who is quickly beaten by the strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES HAVE A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE ??? Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Of course, black men never reject their own people and Omar Epps easily moves with them. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens its white chambers and keeps them in line are just stupid - of course he is the dominant one while his poor white room mats sit in fear of him and eventually leave. This movie was just awful and the end made me laugh aloud. The overly slow movement between Epps and Banks is hilarious with the faces they make. It's like watching my cousin and cousins ​​(and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
