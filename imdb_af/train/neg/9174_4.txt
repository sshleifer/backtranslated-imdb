I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just bad. <br /> <br /> The good parts: Girl swims topless with thong bottoms, Sonya Salomaa's topless, and Ona Grauer's boobs bumped into a bum while running. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many video clips, too much Matrix slow motion (it drags the action), not enough blood and gut, bad acting, and no story. The only other person in the theater was clever and left to the topless swim scene. A total waste of $ 6 and time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
