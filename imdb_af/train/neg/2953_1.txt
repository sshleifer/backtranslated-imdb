These reviews claiming this movie are so bad it goes well, go overboard with that one. This movie doesn't have the guilty pleasure that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their horror, but this heap of dinosaur dung is so bad, it's painful. I was not in so much pain to watch a bad movie as I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust The New Line Cinema has refused to deploy theaters. They cut the losses it sends straight to video, making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi rushed to be in this disaster after a huge salary. <br /> <br /> Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles on the sun that will kill humanity and start another ice age. A female policeman, named Katie Coltrane, and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex, reluctantly pulls him to stop him after the death of a dinosaur girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the movie that is the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to handle the fact that this movie is really awful. Whoopi looks excited and tries to do it with her performance, but to no avail. Theodore Rex is clatteringly irritating and its bumbling behavior is thin after five minutes on the screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him and threaten to bite people and hit people with his tail (accidentally and with the goal). I thought Burglar was bad, but it took a backyard for Theodore Rex: the worst film of Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didn't see it when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck written by people who had bad admiration for the movie Howard The Duck. The humor is at that level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's innate cousin. Very painful from start to finish.
