The Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top notch set production. Well-detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> Awful mix of actors with all CGI actors mixing fifth element with Final Fantasy. The CGI actors are even worse than video games a few years ago. Defective logic. A giant pyramid appears and no one is investigating it, no one really asks. And there's no explanation why even the god Horus was wiped out, and was there no reason why he should do something as trivial as to fertilize Jill? <br /> <br /> Horrible: <br /> <br /> Terrible writing. So much unnecessary subplots with too many ideas not fully realized. The dialogue was almost ridiculous on some points. Random characters and events not needed. Dull characters. Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the author. There's nothing to her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no dust, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is not one character in the whole movie that has any purpose, any goals (except the obvious one from Horus), any motivation. They are poor and poorly fertilized. There is no game - the key to screen writing. Horus will not be immortal, but great thing, he is a bad man. One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. This is the problem: to spend half of the film on each character, the author never means one character, and never brings one to fruit. They are cardboard cuttings that walk around and talk and do pretty much nothing, but explore the fine pieces. First time director pacing. Still, still, still. I'm still watching the movie while writing it. I can't pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall: <br /> <br /> Not worth a watch. Cordless story, sub-par character development, corny CGI does not save the beautiful set production.
