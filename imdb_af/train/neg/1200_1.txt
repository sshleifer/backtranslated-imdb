VERY boring, obvious, boring Exorcist rip-off with a Doberman red-eye - that's the scale of the special effects in this made-for-TV cheap. Richard Crenna is about as animate as a cold toy. Many 70's clothes and music just add to the torture. Have to sleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Virtually worthless. MooCow says eaghhh is a stinking dog! : = 8P
