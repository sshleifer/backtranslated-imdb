What a horrible piece of garbage !!! Who are all these people about how good it is? Yes, it is "arty"; And yes, it's "strange", but .... it's not enough. The plot is boring and unpleasant, like a reality show, but not so smooth. <br /> <br /> The people are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, I feel very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The violence (and some of them very violent) looks rather exaggerated and free. It is as if the producer is Quenton Tarantino's visions. Not that I think much of him either. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, if I had neighbors like this, I'd move!
