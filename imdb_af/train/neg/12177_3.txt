Since the 1970s, writer / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror B films. Some of them are great examples of how to use a small budget to maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare jewels. <br /> <br /> A Terminator style story of time travel and action, Trancers played Tim Thomerson Jack Deth, a future policeman who had the task of finding bad parents. Whistler, who has traveled past an ancestor's body in the past. Whistler is able to control other people with his psychic powers, turn it into obedient zombies (the "trancers" of the title) and try to change the course of history by forcing the ancestors of the leaders of the future . Jack followed him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In this 1991 sequel, Jack remains in 1985. After destroying Whistler, he settled and with Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie . But for Jack, things don't stay calm for a long time, and the problems appear in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build a trancer army. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a great disappointment in the light of how good the original was. The story is hard to pick up if you haven't seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there is a lot of unforeseen action and some bad special effects. Away is the ingenuity and white that made Trancers so much fun; Instead, we get some cheesy one-liners and a script that feels it is written on the plane. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can give for recommending this movie to fans of the genre is the cast, which boasts many names that will be known to the followers of sci-fi and horror films: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them were downhill while filming Trancers II, and performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Trancers series has its supporters; Four further successors have since been exhausted. Unless the quality has picked up, I can't imagine they are good.
