I won't spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive, I felt I just had to let people know that not everyone is so excited, let alone intellectually caused by this attempt to create a fascinating philosophical film-like mystery. Some scenes were promising, with visual dimensions played, but could not stop the rest. I felt like I was stoned again for the first time, with semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents. <br /> <br /> What a useless effort to raise the Dutch cinema to new heights. I'd rather see that Jesus is a Palestinian, without all pretenses and with straight humor, and also raises questions about life and the realities we create for us. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard. or Tarkovsky and apparently will never be.
