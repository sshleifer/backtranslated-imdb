This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both and not so good. It is also slow and reasonably predictable. It also has shades of Salvation and the Amityville Horror.plus, we get some new life flavor thrown into the mix and some of the scenes come off as a motivational / inspirational sermon. Really, this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything. Although it is gory, the makeup effects are not very realistic looking. In fact, they look cheap. From this all there is a very terrible clich√© of dialogue. And I won't say when, but there is a point where some of the character's actions were not in the authentic or credible circumstances. no one in their right minds that would act like this. Looking at the movie, you will know what I mean. There is also some free necklace for nudity. It was just not necessary at all. The good news is that the acting was actually pretty good. Better than this movie, s.so, after we carefully weighed the testimony, said id said this movie was tradable, but not good. My pronunciation for The Tooth fee: 4/10
