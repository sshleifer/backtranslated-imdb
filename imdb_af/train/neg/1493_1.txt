I really can't figure out how people made this movie and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more mysterious are those who watched this movie without cheating 88 minutes to do something valuable like reading under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> In the first place, they could have 2 real Irish people, and some beautiful women who could deliver their lines better than the excited, hard-wearing pornstars spread throughout this movie. Granted, the gore works - but strangely, it's not as disturbing as you might think organs from the porn stars' hot (formerly) stiff bodies have seen left and right. Probably it has something to do with the fact that after their terrible inhuman acting they just want them to die in pain. <br /> <br /> So, if you don't care about the following: <br /> - acting (seriously, everyone has sucked. I've never seen it before. Everyone sucked) . <br /> <br /> plot (some crazy horror movies are remotely linear, or at least surprising. movie doesn't make sense unless you're as dirty as the writers were of course). <br /> <br /> - theme (nothing to learn from this movie. Nothing to be afraid of in bed at night, nothing to think or understand or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as usual and sow like writing). <br /> <br /> - Landscape (Can this movie's saving grace be, but no ... nothing pleasant here. Even the rocks are fake). <br /> <br /> So, yes. If you don't mind and you are just a horny teen with bad taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. Positive Comment: Interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic gore; Again, wasted. But the bowels are classic. I agree with the mutant disembowelment solve the false accent problem.
