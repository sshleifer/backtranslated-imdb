I'm a fan of the series and have read 7 books. I just wanted to see it to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who have to see it are those who have already read the series and are curious. It's pretty bad, and will turn you off to read them. Not to be mean, but Lucy is so ugly that it detracts from the movie. Was she the director's daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. She had an overbearing that any beaver would be ashamed of. The movie loses just as much in translation. CS books don't translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books, or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Aslan! done very well. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) seem stupid, Aslan was really well done, as it wasn't just a human actor walking around. (I think she is like the old horse custume? 2 people inside?) Also, I'll be curious about kids of this movie. Maybe they will enjoy it? But for adults, safe betting, they won't be accustomed, even if a CS fan.
