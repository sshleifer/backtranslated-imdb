... it would have been what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone can't describe how bad it is. If you struggle to sleep, it jumps in and I guarantee you will be in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40's - but he's calling it here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" told Robin that he and Batman had to run to the house at one stage of the car and that Lowery had doubled over the camera because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hat than a boy's wonder. In fact, he is more like a man in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick off so he can carry the big cape. <br /> <br /> Drive a Batmobile that looks like it's rolled off Honest Al's used car much under the sticker - the Dynamic Duo doesn't bother to hide the fact it's Bruce Wayne's car they drive not - in fact, it is continuously recorded by several characters. the series. <br /> <br /> The play is wood - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is terrible and if there is even a script they follow, it is sure that it reads according to the lines of "Batman says something here" because it definitely seems like they are building it up as it goes. <br /> <br /> Batman's Utility belt is made of thin material without any apparent pockets to keep its gadgets - at one stage when Batman needs a full-size torch, the producers just put one as the scene starts - never seen again no. His cow is so bad that he can't even see it, and his ears look more like floppy than the unhappy easter bunny as they do something good. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I don't mind), Batman replaces counterfeit radioactive money that will burst into flames, the second being exposed to air as a payout to some hoods. It is radioactive so it can detect it - the reason why it is so highly flammable is not explained. Well, the boevies unfortunately open the parcel in a cardboard warehouse. We know this is a cardboard warehouse because Batman entered and dumped these boxes which seemed to weigh six ounces on the hoods to knock them out - and soon the whole place burned to the ground. Thanks Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene after the Batmobile is turned off, Batman flies a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car - leaving the man to care for himself and telling him not to worry no. Because if Batman defeats the car, the police will definitely buy another one! Yes, you guessed it, said a cliff of a cliff within a few seconds. Not that it matters much to the motorist who probably died of exposure, trying to go back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman. - She had noticed the Batmobile parked outside Bruce's house - or maybe she saw Batman and Robin walk in the clear, densely populated suburban neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Everything about this series is bad - And everyone except the youngest in the audience will want to throw toast on the screen. If you are looking for a bad theater, you can't beat a better point. If you want to entertain, try the Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman TV series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman series.
