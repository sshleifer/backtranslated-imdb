Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual cracks and moans try to make up for a messy but thin story. Acting is rare brothers. Why Liam Neeson signed for this is someone's guess. Owen Wilson really turns into one of the worst appearances in recent horror film history. Catherine Zeta Jones is nice to look at and not much else, although Lili Tayor did an above average job. The special effects were pretty memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and haunting. However, they cannot act for the poor and the storyline that was cast at the last minute. Don't bother.
