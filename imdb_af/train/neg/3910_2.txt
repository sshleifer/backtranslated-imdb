Isabel Allende's magical, lyrical novel of three generations of an aristocratic South American family has been vandalized. The terrifying boss of a movie that resulted - mainly due to the wonderful role-players of Anglo actors who could endure the elusive Latin compassion of Allende's characters and a Scandinavian live hand - was so uncomfortable in his own what I returned. to the theater for a second time to make sure I didn't have something important that would change my mind. To my disappointment, I missed nothing. No one under Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave can feel the trap set by director Bille August for them. All of them looked completely thankful and resigned, as if, by doing so little effort, they were expected to become unseen in glorious time sets. (Yes, the movie is directed within an inch of his life.) It is advisable that the production designer allowed the gaffe to place KFC products prominently in a scene that came into existence around 1970 for KFC. It was first known for its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving it, in Kentucky was Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1970 in a military dictatorship in South America? American fast food only hit South America in the early 1980s. "The House of the Spirits" had been the 1993 movie event. Because it was so clumsy and slavish to his vague idea of ​​what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was not an event or art. And for that, Isabel Allende had to press charges for rape.
