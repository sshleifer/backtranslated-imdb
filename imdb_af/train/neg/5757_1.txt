The movie was watchful while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight the passing of boredom when Meryl Streep's film was dependent on wearing scenes without Jack; she was as dirty as it could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; These characters were depicted before - and much better. It felt the worst way, like a scenario, in the right way: 90% of daily life is boring, and not worth writing or watching. Why Ephron felt her life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about escaping me. Maybe she wrote it as therapy. For many writers, cathedrals are an episode of their paper life. Good: But then why someone in Hollywood feels this story was worth filming, remains a mystery to me.
