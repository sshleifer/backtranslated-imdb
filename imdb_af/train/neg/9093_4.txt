I saw this movie for the first time today and I have never heard it, probably because of its poor message. <br /> <br /> First, directing itself is pretty good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is great. But it alone does not make a movie. No story whatsoever, no message behind beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Let me remind you, the art of a director is not just your vision, but knowing how to tell a story. And that's what misses the entire 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple 4 rating.
