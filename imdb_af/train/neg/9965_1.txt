WARNING! SMALL PLOT DETAILS REVEALED! <br /> <br /> I can't find anything positive about this movie. It's so badly written that every character is a caricature, but it seems to take it seriously. It was poorly cast, especially Ralph Macchio (everything with a baby face, 5 feet-nothing from him) as a street fish difficult. Plot elements are all drawn in black and white, with each situation almost immediately reaching a peak. ______________________________ One can only imagine the filmmakers say: "We need JoBeth to throw her top ... hmmm ... I got it! ... early in the movie, let's give Nick a ridiculous dialogue about yourself in the corridors ... then JoBeth can later use that line on him and BIG LOTS in the corridor ... yes, it's the ticket! "<br /> <br /> I will give the producers credit for a weighty subject in 1984, one that was too much in the late 90s with events like Columbine. However, the execution is terrible. This film could be a dark comedy in the year of Heathers, a campus political statement such as "Network" or a serious investigation like "Brubaker". Instead, it tries to be all these things - and eventually nothing gets these things. "Teachers" get a F.
