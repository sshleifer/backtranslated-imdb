I sat to see this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not close enough. I honestly couldn't tell what genre this movie was to watch it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot was non-existent and the acting was terrible. My friends and I watched this movie about 30 to 40 minutes before we turned it off and asked the video store to take it back. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you deliberately try to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly don't know how this movie lasted for more than a day in the theaters and besides, I can't understand why anyone wants to see it, as it's not just the very uninteresting title, but also the lack of familiarity. actors / actresses in the film. This review is not a joke and I honestly think it may be the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever had.
