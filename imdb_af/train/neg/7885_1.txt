I believe that religion is kept from government and from the movies. If I want a sermon, I'll go to church, but I don't want one of a movie. I don't care about some supernatural themes (religion is after all supernatural than you can get!) But this film had so much preaching that I was really irritated. The landlady reminds me of witches seen from other films. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a fool ends: the hero went to the meeting and shouted at all the old men, and it broke the spelling. If only life was so simple. I think when movies are so stupid they need to be warned: DANGER! PREACHING INCLUDED HERE!
