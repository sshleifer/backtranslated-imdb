What a bad excuse for New Zealnd Movie Making. I am ashamed to call a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (August 2006). The casting consists of a large number of local sea stars. The ship is, in real life, one of the ferries between the islands that travels daily between the two main islands and even the company's logo (a dolphin) is still across the range including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a ship / vessel between the US and Mexico. It has clear signs of rust and age throughout the place, but it is supposed to be a luxury ship on shipping. One of the scenes shows the snow-covered peaks of New Zealand's South Island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the New Zealand / American accent just doesn't work. I expect the New Zealand taxpayer to have contributed to the production cost of this movie and it was a waste of money that was better spent on real production. I know high school children in New Zealand who can make better movies with their phones. Goof: There is a truck in the container with the label on it and they have stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look American. But some of the signs are on top of the label - you'd think they'd noticed it in the props department before it was attached. I'd like to go on, but it's just not worth it.
