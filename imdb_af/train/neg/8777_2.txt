Okay, I struggled to put the fact that the movie in selling EVP was really nice to me. I reasoned hell, I don't believe in vampires, but I still loved Dracula so I could live through it. <br /> <br /> But even with that, the movie is just not very good. It is made competent and acted upon, but it does not really take you up. There are several "jump" moments, and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I didn't expect it" without actually jumping into the slightest. <br /> <br /> The resolution also doesn't make sense. If the power behind this is to do the things it seems to be, why does hell need to use a proxy? Plus, the end caption was absurd. They made it clear as part of the "credibility of the film by claiming it, that's all really", but to work it really should be at the beginning. But they can't sit at the beginning, because then they give away the plot. Just stick it to the end, it just makes it a sore thumb.
