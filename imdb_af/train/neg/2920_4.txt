Wow! I'm shocked to learn that it's a small world and we're all connected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne made it much better in one sense. "Nobody is an island." The acting wasn't bad. The children gave everything they had, but sometimes the thread became so thin. I couldn't follow it and the only true "hero" in the movie ends in jail after being harassed by a virgin. I do not know. I just can't get it. Oh good.
