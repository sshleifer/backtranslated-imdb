I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with extremely low-budget movies, and I enjoy movies with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can suggest something like that, watch 'wiseguys vs zombies' if you're interested). Indeed, I prefer lower-budget zombie movies, because I'm suspicious that Hollywood directors don't understand what zombies are. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was just as bad. This is delayed. I do not want to be worthy of my criticism. I want to have 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it only took 80 minutes, because I took it fast in 1.4X. <br /> <br /> Well, here's some criticism. <br /> 1. The pacing was terrible. Everyone spoke to monologues. Even when someone just had a single line, the camera worked and editing and inserting a bunch of F-bombs in every sentence, the line felt like a monologue. Initially I was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to ZB1's 70 minutes, but there were actually less 'events' in ZB3. It speaks everything. <br /> <br /> 2. The gore effects have become stupid. Just glop rubs on people's tummies. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic outline, there really wasn't a plot. And the exposition is actually epic! I won't spoil it if you look at it. (Don't look at it.) But then it's just a bunch of lame characters moving around and bending for ~ 80 minutes. or less, if you prefer.
