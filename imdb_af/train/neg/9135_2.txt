Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. It is your magnum opus, a brilliant example for the rest of us that you are definitely worthy of the nomination in the Academy of Moving Visual Arts and Sciences (as shown on your 1998 erawebsite). Oh, it is better to remain silent and to be a fool than to speak and remove all doubts. With Ben & Arthur, you do it. <br /> <br /> Along with a lack of education or education, the film's screenplay guides us to the real bizarre with every new scene. It is this crazy excuse for a story that can also be the best ally of the movie. The homosexual titular characters Ben and Arthur begin to marry, as far as flying over the land to do so, in the shadow of Vermont's most beautiful palm trees. But all this attitude is merely an advantage for BLOOD. Then more BLOOD, AND MORE AND MORE BLOOD. I mean, there should be at least $ 20 in the fake blood makeup in the last third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a technical gaff. From the sound to the editing of the music, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note held on a keyboard, it is a wonder that the movie even keeps track of what media you see it. It is so sad that some decent amateurs are being wasted here. <br /> <br /> No matter, Sam. I'm sure you've made five figures on this movie in rents or whatever is driving bad souls (like myself) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we don't laugh with you.
