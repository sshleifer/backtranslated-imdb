Don't listen to the deceptive title "Werewolf Woman". The Europeans are known for the emphasis on sex and nudity about the real scare in their horror movies, but this one is just a little too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have cheated a messy sex scene with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this gets very monotonous fast. Not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor hangs for lycantropy. The film cannot even determine its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) that is legal supernatural horror (I thought I was a classic reference section) after a rather poor character study of the female repeated abuse and torture until a vengeance. In the end, the director insists that it is based on a true story. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some entertaining aspects of production. The title werewolf woman is a viewer and there are some pretty grim effects and nude screens. However, it quickly becomes monotonous. The purchased dialogue is scarcely hilarious in a camp mode, especially the world's waving doctor (he is drinking at work). Unfortunately, the film becomes very annoyingly fast. There is no real plot or anything else really. It's a pity, because I read a description, I felt the movie had real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is long overdue, slow moving, and a little too useless, even according to the standards of exploitation genre. (4/10)
