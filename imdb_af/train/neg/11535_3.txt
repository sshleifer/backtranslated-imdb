Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven, professional woman who picks up work dancer Danny Dyer for an evening of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked. After the recovery, and after a casual encounter with one of the attackers, their minds change to revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "Straightheads" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I didn't like much of the phrase, I'd call 'Straightheads' a video nasty. Certainly it was the kind of movie that would have had no budget release in the dark of the 1980s. Frankly, I don't know how "Straightheads" had a cinema release. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prude. I don't care about sex and violence in the movies, but they must be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" also didn't have. No progression in the plot or characters and too much left unexplained and unseen. Fortunately, 'Straightheads' didn't go anywhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was a pity because there was the germ of an interesting movie here, with a particularly interesting twist in the plot in the last third. How often I say it, but it could have been good if it was done properly. What a pity. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they have nothing to hide with this movie. She is especially underestimated (and still very fit). <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows 'Dead Man's Shoes'. This is a small masterpiece. Last weekend I had seen his "This Is England". Ce sera sera ...
