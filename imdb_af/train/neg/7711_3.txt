The film's heart was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a spoof a la "plane!" (two years before the fact - nice going.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruit, attack. <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of movie magic (stop motion, paper mache on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball size tomatoes at screen actors), fall Tomatoes are indeed all in their leaves. <br /> <br /> Then it's Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I wouldn't want on any government's side to save the day. Of course, there is an engaging reporter (Taylor) who goes into the worst times, dancers and singers, army soldiers, Japanese scientists with tumbling voices, a guy dragging a parachute and a samurai sword, and oh the San Diego Kip before he made it big. <br /> <br /> The gags here aren't that good. In fact, you can probably make yourself better after watching it. Some of the dialogue is indifferent ("Please keep the ketchup" - not something to say for tomatoes.) And as far as "Puberty Love" goes ... well, I can't blame the tomatoes for tightening it up . <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I like the theme song and the start credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at one time that was pretty well executed. ... it's about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a "killer" comedy, but try it. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
