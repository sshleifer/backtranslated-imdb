Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity, but I only watched it for the first time last night and it easily put me in my bottom five of all time. Was it supposed to be about the love story or the zombies? This movie was so bad that after it graciously ended, all I could do, I laugh, how ridiculously bad it was. Fortunately, I'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the whole thing or I won't be able to brag about watching it all in one meeting! I like to think of something that can be said positive about everything in life. Therefore, I will be able to recognize this movie's most positive asset. It was very short for a full length movie.
