After reading some good reviews, I also decided to rent Come On Undone. I must say I was disappointed. The story was difficult to follow, as the film is a series of flashbacks between the current and recent past, which are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the actors' best efforts, are flat and uninteresting. The sex and nudity are more explicit than they should be. I have never seen a movie where it was so unnecessary for the plot. The end is very anti-climate and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that is not well explained, to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
