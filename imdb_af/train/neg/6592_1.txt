Brief summary: This movie demonstrates everyone who touches it. That means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say I'm not a puris, and it might have been funny for a few minutes. The imitations are not bad. But in general, it's just boring and careless. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these movies only exist for the last few bucks from the new Laurel and Hardy brand. The producers can't really consider their place in film history or their talents. This offended me most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
