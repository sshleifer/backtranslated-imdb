I'm a back Batman movie and TV fan. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not as big as some people hope to be. In my opinion, this is a major deviation. I think the problem was that it had no drama. Batman: Phantasm Mask And Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker Had A Lot Of Drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this movie is up to Batman. The only scene that looks a bit dark is the big battle with Bane at the end. Anyway, this is a good Batman movie. But I'll just rent it out.
