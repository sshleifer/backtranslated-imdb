The fact that there is positive comment on Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just let me realize that their junket staff are working hard to get people to see this horrific movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, no idea where to begin to describe the really horrible movie I put on last night - Then in real life. Steve's characters in previous films made me believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed by the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so confronted, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the movie was so many times before I was shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and make a pass on this terrifying bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb, as the first comment was clearly written by people sitting in another theater watching a good movie .
