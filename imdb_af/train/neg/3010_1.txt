holy sh * t it was god terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes, and I thought I was going to get into the shepherd Oedipus Rex very soon. Dear God. This movie does not earn more credit than anything made by a middle school movie buff. Please save your money, this movie can offer you nothing. unless you enjoy side-views and sleep in movies. you know, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you will be the only one in any case. F @ ck this slideshow. <br /> <br /> You are warned. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hello. <br /> <br /> how are you? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I'm. <br /> <br /> This comment was one hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this day movie. it is sad.
