Warning: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who remembers this sui generis movie, is just as sensible as a reminder of Psycho - oh, that's right, an idiot has done it - I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Film opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving that he's not so clever from the beginning. Marky Mark appears in the lap without showing his distinctive underpants, and is then rejected by a white woman who prefers chimpanzee touch. <br /> <br /> The perfection of the space station that surrounds Saturn for no apparent reason, inside of ship raising with monkey genetic experiments. Do we have to travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to perform these experiments? The special effects team decides it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimps are lost in the staple of the 60-year-old sci-fi cinema - Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station's staggering security impetus by stealing a podium without anyone noticing it, while at the same time stupidly stupidly stealing a deep-rescue mission in a wormhole for a million-million-mile-long, exhausted test-chip. dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say, "Pointless Remake," Marky followed the worm, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought of killing the atmosphere and was being chased by a sound stage which looks almost like a lush rainforest, if it's not for the cliches that lighten the plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! This is APES doing the pursuit - or at least it would be a surprise if nobody saw Planet of the Apes THIRD YEAR. <br /> <br /> Since Marky Mark could not show his pecs, take off his pants or brush his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorillas are suddenly helped to establish his * lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (an annoying chimpanzee activist), with a loss without a Shakespeare script, did a good job of executing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, ensured the role of token-comic relief and interspecies klutz. Although I grew up in the hearing of words related to this movie, a review headline took the essence of this planet from the monkeys "re-imagination": "The Apes Of Roth". While everyone else clipped to look like extras of one million years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, massive amounts of scenery and cake chewed brilliant cake. As his imagination of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a book of behavior: Thade is angry when we first meet him ... and he is almost at the same level of anger at the end of the film. Nice twist. <br /> <br /> The original POTA (1968) had a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so disillusioned with man that he left the earth for space without any regrets. But as the film progresses, Taylor has unknowingly locked himself in a fight to prove humanity's worth - as their only champion! The original film was finally a story of humiliation, not redemption: when Taylor discovered the Statue of Liberty, he was forced to realize that his species had NOT conquered. Is there anything that is cerebral or ironic for Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there is a lot of running. <br /> <br /> The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet. But this is the APES planet. In this movie, people and monkeys landed here, the people gave in to people, so the monkeys could get speech and sensual body weapons; Protect the monkeys to inherit the planet! Along Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, it goes without saying that people should be the Apex predators simply because they are there. "If it's back, it's as ridiculous as monkeys landing here in 2001, complaining:" A planet where people developed from APES !! " and then they cause problems with their overworking and hairy anuses. <br /> <br /> Heston was thrown into the 1968 POTA because it established its reputation as a maverick. He was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! Throwing him as a dumb beast into an alien society was bumping an audience's expectations. How far should a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot respect? Marky Mark has just established that he has tight underpants. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly degraded by the monkey board, he dominated the screen with his charisma and overwhelming overwork. When Marky Mark tries to feel in the Mongolian people, it's like an unpopular guy in the school, who suddenly becomes a classroom monitor, telling you to stop penciling on the blackboard and throwing a shoe with him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to the icon of mankind, but he comes down as a shaky devil. In the original film, the monkeys considered Taylor a deviant, but he was, as well as hearing and monkeys, an icon of humanity. It's irony again. <br /> <br /> It was fitting that a man who cheated on a theatrical technique - Heston - would play the film's first shoulder, Thaddeus Roth. Like Roth's monkey dad, Charlton outlines his own immortal lines, this time turns to the people: "Damn them! Damn them all to hell!" <br /> <br /> The movie becomes stupid and stupid at the end While Thaddeus Marky teaches a devastating lesson, a podium comes from the top with Marky's chimpanzee in it, and Apes demonstrates their heroism by bowing to these unknown creatures, while Marky proves his own mercy by mumbling: "Let us show this monkeys learn about evolution. "First, they are not monkeys, you monkey! Secondly, it was genetic engineering and imbecile plot making that brought the monkeys to this point, not evolution. And what you plan to teach them by wiping them away with the hidden laser gun, misanthropy is called, not evolution. <br /> <br /> To give the turning end, only viewers will confuse than to believe that Estella Warren's half-necked role was actually integral to the plot (still be my pants.). <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that he was man's last underpowered hope; In the end, cop monkeys take Marky away to the Plot Point Prison where he last heard, he said, "It's a madhouse! A MADHOUSE !! ...
