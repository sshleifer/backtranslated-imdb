** SPOILERS ** A little ridiculous for TV movie, sexy and middle-aged gold engraver Isabelle Collins, Susan Tucci, a number on every man she comes into contact with in the movie. Once they win their hearts, then their purses and then, when no longer used for her, are thrown into the paper basket like a bloated Kleenex fabric. <br /> <br /> Isabelle's first victim is no different from her abuse, keeping Isabelle to catch his bank account, man Stewart, John O'Hurley. It is later in the movie when Isabelle is very friendly with the former plumber and now the hunting salesman, Richard Davis, Philip Casnoff, that she, without really telling him, is the totally love-sick Richard a contract on her unsuspecting man's life. To get this ex-debtor, once released from jail, Daggett, Nicholas Campbell, to do the work on Stewart Richard, he soon finds that he didn't get exactly what he paid, $ 15,000 cash. /> <br /> To get a little too greedy Daggett, Stewart's brain not only exited, but also a solid gold watch, which Stewart offered him to spear his life as well. The watch was easily traced to Daggett when he tried to hide it at a local jewelery store where he was quickly arrested. With Doggett he spills on who hired him to strike Stewart. It is not long before the long arm of the law to arrest Stewart, by hiring Doggett, murderer Isabelle's husband to be former plumber and hunting salesman Richard Davis! Davis's arrest by police happened just as he and Isabelle took the vows of marriage in a local church! <br /> <br /> Isabelle manipulates everyone, only men who fall over her heels, to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work. Always play the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client. Isabelle seems to be a charming life, always one step ahead of the law and the police. Whatever she does, Isabelle covers her so well that it's almost impossible to fight her if someone does, the many crimes she commits, through a second party in the movie. <br /> <br /> After screwing, figuratively as well as literally, her first husband, Steven, her second husband, for less than ten seconds, Richard and finally her, or Richard's lawyer Gavin Kendrick, Kamar De Los Rey, Isabelle knew it was just a matter of time before the police became wise. With the D.A, both Richard and Kendrick get evidence against her Isabelle to know that everything is rapidly making her, her last step. Isabelle and her ten-year-old daughter, Ruby, Lauren Collins, shoot down to the passport office to get everything out of the country. <br /> To get everything in order <br /> That's when the cagey and smart Isabelle make her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie. Isabelle is told by passport clerk Don Carrier, she will have to wait a full 48 hours for her, and Ruby's, passport to clean! Just enough time for the police to find and arrest her! Outlandish ending is almost everything and every ethics in a film noir or crime film. An agreement that will not only drop your mind but your concept of what is right and wrong in the world!
