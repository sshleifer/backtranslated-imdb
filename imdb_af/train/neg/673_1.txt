... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. A 'only-only' remake protruding every click into the abrasive handbook. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A completely poor performance of any effort or excitement. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that ensures no gore, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is not scary or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A cast of characters so thinly written and stereotyped that we may not care about them. <br /> <br /> 7. Lack of an effective, scary atmosphere (very different from the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. An essay on dialogue that is over of the poor - it is senseless. <br /> <br /> 9. A range of cardboard performance (not sure if the actors or the tiring script should blame). <br /> <br /> 10. A completely fearless teen-targeted skater shot that is not brave enough to try to have an imagination - or even show a puddle of blood. <br /> <br /> It's a non-brain horror fans, saving you money. /> <br /> BOMB from ****
