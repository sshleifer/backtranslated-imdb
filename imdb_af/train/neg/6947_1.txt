Without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women who are driven to rob banks, which we somehow supposed to sympathize with. It is difficult to sympathize with characters who make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the police are on us, they know who we are, what are we doing? ... Let's rob a bank, then we're gone! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who is going to die.
