I won't say it's a * bad * movie. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. I've been 14 years old since then, and this film is very poor. F. Murray Abraham is good (and apparently had a screen background), but most of the other actors - especially the students - just seem lost.
