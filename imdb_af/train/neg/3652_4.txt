I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may be affected, but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my first reason for reading this movie was Claire Forlani. While I was watching, I felt she didn't meet my expectations so far from her other films. Actually, I was just as happy to see Arkin turning into a humorous show. The other two actors I wasn't very familiar with, I couldn't compare their performance, but it was also quite enjoyable. The acting is the only engaging quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some might say slightly compelling, didn't have direction. I feel that the main problem comes from writing and not the direction of this movie. If you enjoy these actors to a fair extent, I recommend this movie, but leave it alone.
