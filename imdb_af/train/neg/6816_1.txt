I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget movies, so it wasn't my problem with that. My problem with that is that I feel like I'm watching my neighbor's neighbor's home movie. IMO all about it looks just like a man wrote a quick story, grab a camera, and start shooting. I understand how difficult it should be to do it effectively, but if I pay to rent a movie, I can feel that I'm watching a professional movie. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a great resume, is a good actor, and was good at this movie. The other people in it were not. I understand how fun it is, and cheaper to use friends and family members than the throws, but it doesn't make for convincing action. It was like the way it was shot, and he tried to give many of the screens a more interesting look, but when the writing, plot and play were there, it didn't start and it wasn't necessary. a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also on a technical level, it had digital artworks all over the place. In the first scene of all the fine cars, when they did a slow scan of them, they just came back a little. The problem is not in my viewing equipment, but Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonally" but somewhere in the production. I have never seen that kind of artefact in a professional movie. Then there was the sound. a voice surplus done, which may be good unless it sounds like the cut in this movie, which sounded like the built-in microphone on the camera.
