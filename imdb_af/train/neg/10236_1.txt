Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of cinema purists bump into their slats, allow me to expand it. As I enjoyed it, it's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen and is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen at the theater (an impressive claim, as I remember Daredevil being seen on the big screen ). The two leaders (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were at best unsatisfactory and horrible. Of course, they were not helped by a writing that had so much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste individual and characterization that was as convincing as defending the PB. The plot (to extend the term slightly) was thin not to exist and the 'gore' scenes, though undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and lower-level. Which plot is around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture senses feel like cut off pieces and the emphasis is placed on shocking rather than frightening the audience. Although there are really many, very little positive ones to draw from this movie, its redeeming features are the many mistakes that make it such a horrible movie. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a theater. Within twenty minutes the whole theater was in stitches and remained so throughout. From my side I came out with laughter, roused by a movie ascending to the climax of the frightening movie-making. Whatever you look for, it's really a movie show and a blueprint for future directors' watercases describing little detail about not making a movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I pointed out that I managed to release the movie ... so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back. It was really so bad.
