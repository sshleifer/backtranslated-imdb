It's terribly bad and terribly embarrassed for a Canadian. We become good wine. Our writers and poets are one of the world's best. The National Ballet is named one of the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! This one is not very bad. This is typically typical and typically bad, shot in two sites hotels and public parks with thin direction, high school level acting and "give whiz ... can see what this button does on the camera?" photography. If Michael Moriarity intended to do a Jack Nicholson imitation, couldn't he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson imitation? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the most beautiful cities on earth and also a center of hunting (part of the plot), why in God's name let us dictate that endemic Canadian inferiority complex that it is disguised as Seattle ??? I'm not just crazy about this movie, I'm ashamed and more than a little shy. The Australians display some wonderful things. We produce pretentious second prize piffle. Gawd !!!!!
