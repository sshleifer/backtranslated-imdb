In this extremely low budget (I saw home movies with better production value). The Australian full rip-off of "The Burning" and "Friday the 13th" is a band that is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat. They are hit by a ceremony that has been burned years before. This film is even declared "the worst Australian film ever made" in the DVD advertising material. It's the only selling point! Complete and refuse in any significant way. Maybe there are a few chuckles here and there for the bad movie lovers, but it still made me burn out nicely. <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: a quick flash of almost existing itty bitty titties in a cripple shower <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
