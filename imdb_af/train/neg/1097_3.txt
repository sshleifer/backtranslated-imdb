I realized that the US Army was demoralized by 1971, but this movie was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp, not the SS penalty battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The author must be a true Army hater. The psychic sergeant who hit the shit of people was in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant also had to be dismissed. These men were overseas, the reception units probably wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits came from, and an investigation would have followed. The scene that completely blew it was the electrocution one. Farrell, the alleged vault room attorney, would have had a trainer for issuing an illegal order (to violate POWs contrary to the Geneva Convention), actual assault on a protesting man, sexual assault and an official who was not an official. Intead he just walked away. After this, discipline in a madhouse level remulse and the film becomes immovable. I don't know how it ended, I went to bed.
