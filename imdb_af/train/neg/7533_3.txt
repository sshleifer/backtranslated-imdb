The movie had some nice aspects. Maybe too much for my taste. It seemed as if the author / director was desperately trying to make us feel the inner conflict of ALL characters. Not once, a few times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> It's the work of television, not theater. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed the performance of Sascha Horler as the pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt like Justine Clarke's performance was gone. Her responses to things have forced, as if the director tried to proclaim the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions. I also can't believe a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci in an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the selection of pop-music pop-ups. It's a lazy device, especially where pop music comes from no place to film and / or where the lyrics of the song are embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It's said there is a windy quality over the film that encourages Australian heat and local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that save the film of complete mediocrity, pumping it in with passion and handmade charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious why the dialogue is so overworked. "Who knows if there is a god? Like someone sitting in the air, telling us what to do" or whatever the line is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend who came back from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife: "I quit smoking." <br /> <br /> An anti-smoking commercial? A TAC ad with some tasteful animations? I had to leave the theater at the 50-minute point - it was too much.
