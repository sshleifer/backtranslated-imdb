Battlestar Gallactica was so nice, because it had written sharply, a good look, excellent actors and interesting stories. And yes, warm men and women came around in and out of uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing Actors call a storm to give their 'character'. Outdoor rides that disturb the feel of somewhere else (yes, it's a Ford Focus session in the background). A lot of teenage fear. Lots of naked women (but in the background. It's sure I will be cut for the series) and a token of some men in towels. Neither of the actors except Polly Walker received my attention. At an hour and a half, I still wondered when it would be over. <br /> <br /> So what is it that I have to bring back? Science Fiction? It is very light on it. The actors? Besides Polly Walker's good turn, there's not much interesting thing to do here. There is not even a "hotties" in the role, except perhaps Esai, but for the younger set he is pretty old, because he is older than 25. <br /> <br /> I loved the BSG. I was skeptical when I heard Caprica, and unfortunately I think that's right. I predict it a very short term as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils at SciFi and work to make it more than the OC on another planet.
