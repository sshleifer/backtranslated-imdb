Kind of drawn by the erotic scenes, just to realize it, was one of the most amusing and incredible pieces of film I've ever seen. Kind of like a high school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking ?? And what about all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Nice to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and pretty ridiculous (but very skin, if it intrigues you) made us nonsense. What happened to the bisexual relationship, from nowhere to all the heterosexual encounters? . And what was with that absurd dance, with everyone playing their stereotypical roles? Give this one, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted movie, money that can be spent on hungry children or Aids in Africa .....
