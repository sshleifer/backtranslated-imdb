My wife and I really like to rent dumb horror / sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, if I say this movie is terrible, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera work, story, costumes, is just as cheesy and low budget, but that's what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors seemed to be on their way. I really hope everyone who made this movie was not serious when they made it, because if it were, it would just be sad. If you really want to watch silly horror movies, just to enjoy them, I recommend this one.
