As a tune, I am proud of the handful of good Danish movies produced in the past year. However, it is a terrible disgrace that this quality revival led the majority of Danish film critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish films, and as a result, I stopped watching them in theaters. <br /> <br /> I know it's bad about this unfortunate development against any one movie, so let me emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" would be a terrible movie under all circumstances. The fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with Danish film. Moreover, wait until it came out to DVD, very little help was wasted against the unwavering sense of time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an advanced director with a talent for social realism in Copenhagen. I especially enjoy "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, although he generally plays the same role in all his films, namely that of a worker's club, which falls on his luck, partly because he is a slum but mostly because of society, and what redeem itself by doing something good for its community. <br /> <br /> This is problem number one in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen throws himself as a chicken farmer, who is such a breach of the norm he never succeeds in making it credible. <br /> <br /> However, it is much worse that the movie turns and turns and breaks all the rules of how to tell a story to understand the audience. For example, the film is being used with a very sad effort to visualize the near death experience of the main character using low-budget effects and bad camera work. Then the character tells her best friend that she suddenly feels the urge to throw her off a bridge. It is symptomatic of the whole movie; There is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen persuades to the lowest form of communication whatever the motivation is: Score rather than showing. So, at one point, you have a character who speaks aloud to a seemingly catatonic man about the way he feels, because the script will not allow him to challenge his feelings; And later, voice-over is suddenly introduced, perhaps as a memory, to convey feelings that would otherwise be unknown to the audience because of the director's clumsiness. Luckily, at this point, you're about an hour to look after any of the characters, let alone the so-called story. <br /> <br /> The play, which was often a problem in Clausen's movies, could be summed up in one sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other claim to stars was a participant in Big Brother, is not worse than several of the repetitive actors in the cast. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 out of 10 rating.
