I checked this movie when it had 6 more votes and it was like 7.2 or something, but seriously it is a terrible movie. Let's break it down. The first thing you see about this movie is that it is on a handheld digital camera owned by a first-person at a community college. The next thing you will see is that the actors, all friends of the new man (he met them the previous night at the bar. Third, on the list you will see that the music editor is terrible and they are trying to make a lot of things songs in this movie, at intervals of 30 seconds ... even though the digital editing is done on the foreman's home computer ... probably using Windows Movie Maker, this movie was terrible ... pretentious, has a unmistakably bad script and acting I will not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I judge the author and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
