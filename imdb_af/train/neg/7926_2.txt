The original exploitation classics - although at almost any level of enjoyment on some guys who feed cats in human flesh, because the cat food they make is made with humans, is added with scifi elements added. The cats can't get enough and when the meat runs out of contaminated food, the cats turn their owners on. Poorly compiled at almost every level, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the footage that was actually playing movie theaters in the early 1970s, updated with alien cat and dog struggles for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but loves a person (I usually like the man, thanks to his smile that interviews and comments). You can pretty much excuse the garbage he has mostly carried. Great wanted to make movies and he didn't care how they turned out as long as he produced something. More power for him, but I wish he would not submit to his home movies
