It really should earn an "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I watched this show for centuries, and the show jumped the shark to Series 7. However, this episode is proof that the show jumped the shark. The writing is lazy, absurd, self-sufficient and even not as dirty as Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still have fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy, Count of Monte Cristo - all the "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there is something as ridiculous as in "it's the worst thing I've ever seen." And indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate I've ever seen. It's absolutely terrible, and it comes from someone with a stargate in her basement. <br /> <br /> I want to sell all my stargate props, most seriously.
