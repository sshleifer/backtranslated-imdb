With the massive advertisements it gets on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and this is my son, we bowed to see it. Between DVD and the theaters I have seen everything from the outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) to the very bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear) from now on. But it was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, children or no kids. It was a "when it ended this stupid thing?" kind of experience? OK, it's aimed at toddlers (or it's better - it's insulting to someone's intelligence about 3), but I've never seen so predictably, repetitively, and slowly. Then once you are brave, but relieve the movie is over, there is a bitter thing you think the essay is for a joke, but there is none - it is serious, although it is difficult to know what they are trying to reach. The 3-D effects ... yes, if you've never seen a Viewmaster, it's a big problem, otherwise no (looking at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son was bored at the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and at the end said "wow". Bad in all respects.
