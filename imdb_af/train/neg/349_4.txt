A pot kettle if I ever saw one. A supposed thriller of a time to kill, 'silence of the lambs', even a reverse 'in the heat of the night', with a little reverse murder, a la "strings on a train "thrown in, it abysmally fails where all of the above succeeded to a great extent. On behalf of, in delivering excitement. The plot seems to be conditioned from a larger book, making the plot developments clear and unimportant, while the direction is short and over. To pick up any kudos, a big turn had to be made along the way and it didn't succeed either. Connery was temporarily delayed at his old age, barely trying to bother an American accent and also seemed too old to be Hope Lange's husband and the father of those children of his. He even has a father-in-law who looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne hardly gets the chance to occupy his role and you've been confused from the start whether he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they are confusing here. The rest of the game is merely a moderate role in their endorsed stereotypical roles. The alleged climax also managed to roll by moving me firmly in the back, not like the front of my chair. Moderate messy Hollywood movie sure.
