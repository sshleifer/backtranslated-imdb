At first glance, this movie has everything a psycho wants: a "not under 18" vampire story, filled with hyper violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatic enthusiasts and even ' a gay nekrofilie cop! But then this movie is a succession of a bad story (so thin), bad acting - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you think you're looking at a bad Monty Python - bad music (80-year-old hard rock), the video recording is terrible, the end is a real shame ... Plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous, the gore is not very impressive. And those vampires reflect in a mirror, and don't even fear daylight! You are very disappointed unless you consider it a "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day come to under 100 because it's his right place. <br /> <br /> I want to say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> 3/10
