Certainly, NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, sword games and spectacular landscape kinematics you'll probably see, but it doesn't make a movie good. It helps but the story shines on top of these things. And this is where Nomad walks. <br /> <br /> The story is silent, and it feels like it's thrown together to make a "cool" movie that looks good. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and it's blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to surprise us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazakh, they can better use actors / actresses who see the part. <br /> <br /> War tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our "heroes" are all touched, but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush aside for the next battle sequence, the next action horse or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that some significant changes have been made to Nomad during his filming, specifically the director and filmographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (filmographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one sense, Laustsen looks the better, as his country's visions have made the final cut we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the transition to Bodrov as director was not the wisest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on fighting and not the people I feel come from Bodrov's eyes and not Passer's. A true transvesty. <br /> <br /> The shameful thing is that it could be a fantastic movie, with both character and action focus. Unfortunately, the high kicks apparently decided that action was needed and took the cheap (intellectually) way out. <br /> <br /> Although I cannot give this movie a positive rating, it is worth watching just for the wonderful movie work. But that's all.
