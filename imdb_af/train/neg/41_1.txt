How can you say a horror movie is terrible? if you can't stop laughing! The plot is well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things. These are some of the reviews. <br /> <br /> Some reviews placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought It was in a random island in the Pacific. Where this happens exactly, it seems to be a mystery. The cannibal stem is conformed by some black women, some black men and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who beats the drums. The Devil God is a great black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. <Br /> <br /> One of the "freakiest" moments in the movie is when "Pablito" finds his mate hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance I accept blood. , start shouting for minutes over and over (it's actually funny), and then the head of his mate falls into the ground and "Pablito" kicks it a little for what I assume is "shits n 'giggles" and the eyes actually move ... <br /> <br /> But of course, the "freak" is gone if you realize the eyes are moving because the movie is not bad. <br /> <br /> I didn't laugh so much in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab a beer hole and start watch this movie, you will love it! If you're looking for a real horror or gore movie, don't ... bother.
