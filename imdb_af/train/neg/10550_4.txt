After being a big fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of 'Stella Street', I expected this movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was appalled that almost all the gags and one liners were lifted directly from the TV episodes, and with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, than if the actors once said and it can't be bothered to tell them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt that I had separated with my hard-earned cash to watch the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The plot of the movie begins with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey), gradually populated by some of the best-known people of the stage and the screen of the past forty Years including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the street celebrities are slaughtered out of their fortunes by a local fraudster and forced to live like bumps and ordinary workers. There are some nice moments, but in general the writers can make an interesting idea and make it boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In the T.V Episodes, all characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the movie Ronni Ancona is added to the movie. I think it was a mistake. Her impersonations were not funny, and it felt that her characters were included in the story, just to do something to her. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you might find this movie entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you can get away, feel a bit cheated. 10/04
