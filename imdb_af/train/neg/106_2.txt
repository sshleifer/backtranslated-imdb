1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about carnivorous zombies in a 3 story movie story. And yes, we see zombies seeing human flesh parts in 3D !! Wow, not! It's been done in 2D in a zombie movie time and time again, but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story, not the actual flesh. It made the original zombie classics good. The meat was only thrown in as extra. We are actually bored by most of this 3-part chronicle due to the lame (twilight zone like) easily understandable and slowly-pacingly revealing finals. The last story is actually the story that the movie started (with a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we also see meat eating the zombie in that one. Well, I think I said enough. Look at the classic, not the 3D drill festival.
