What about this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> This is the impressive underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that sometimes works well! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is speeding up! Especially when the shark or the bad things are coming soon! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is slowing down! As if it's being conveyed to the audience, it's time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> As another one bites the dust! As if in a "Spagetti Western", it has many similarities! <br /> <br /> It's not that the Italians can't produce quality productions! There was a series of TV titles titled "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, which were watched over mafia-type conflicts on the SMT TV in Australia in the 1990s! And they were excellent! But unfortunately, you won't find it here! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was about 1960s! Unfortunately, it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the razor sharp bite of the speedy shark that caused a red dust to emerge repeatedly in the blue waters! <br /> <br /> In the midst of everything, either in the bar-room noise or in the sight of the latest sore bloody demolition by the inexorable hungry shark, the measure of the hero looks through his glasses with little concern, He was also bored in his relentless role amid a lack of evidence of plot or someone's character development! <br /> <br /> At least, the hero indicates a brief concern for his former wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the music hasn't awakened our realization, we have the sinister sound in the bad voices, as if we want to turn up a dark act! <br /> <br /> And near the end, someone thought of a twist! Just when we thought it was all predictable! But keep quiet, people, because you can still find a spin! If you look now! To, more or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the advice of the hero and keep a few beers along the way! This will make your performance of "Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like a "007" movie to lighten your way back into reality when it's over !!!
