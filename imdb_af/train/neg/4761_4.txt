Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic play about a man who visits the man of his lover, and all this goes sideways. The original movie was played by Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has the Olivier role in this release and he is with Jude Law. Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The play is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are gang members in their respective roles. I really like the chemistry and the clash of personalities. It's great and enough of a reason to watch the script's direction. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialogue is sharp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play (which has been updated to use surveillance cameras and the like). The problem is that how the script moves the characters is terrible. Michale Caine walks right through his strange modern house with sliding doors and panels for no good reason. Conversations happen repeatedly in different places. I know Pinter did it in his plays, but in this case it gets boring. Why do we have to go over and over and the law is sleeping with Caine's wife? It would be good if we had said enough at one stage or another that we did it, but he didn't do it the first time. The script doesn't even move Caine through his manipulation of the law as well. To start with, he is blindly angry to start, so he has no chance to turn us and frighten us. (Never be late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he was bothered). In the original we never suspected that acted. Here we do and while giving a head start, it also feels somehow false because it's so clear that we're forced to wonder why Law's Milo doesn't see him being erected. There are a few other cases, but to say more will give away too much. <br /> <br /> Think of the movie in retrospect I think it's a movie of missed opportunities and missteps. The wasted opportunities are the chance to have better fireworks between Caine and Law. Failure to remove a crazy setting and strange plot shifts from the creation of tension and a credible thriller. Instead, we get a smart dialogue and good performances in a movie they don't really make. <br /> <br /> Despite some good performances and a fun dialogue, it's only 4 out of 10 because the rest of the writing doesn't work
