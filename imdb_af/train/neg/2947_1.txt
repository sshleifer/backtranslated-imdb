There were very few movies I couldn't pass through. I made it through Battle Field Earth, no problem. But this is one of the worst movies ever to be made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg was trying to deal with it. I don't blame her. I would be ashamed to have it on a resume. I believe this is a rare opportunity when almost every gag in a movie falls flat on his face. Well, it happens here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables attached to it. Halfway through the movie I was still looking for a plot. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of renting it and saving 90 minutes of your life.
