Interestingly, 90% of high-pitched voices all consist of "* random username *" of "United States" (no state prototype) which all say more or less exactly the same thing with exactly the same grammatical style and all with exactly the same complete lack of taste in movies. I will further delve into this suspicious trend, but unfortunately this is an overview of the movie, not the reviews themselves. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true zealous movie. fan. That means I've seen a lot of movies, from good to bad, and can quite claim that Facing The Giants is not a good movie. It has good intentions, but fails to meet many (if any) basic standards that I bring with a quality movie story. <br /> <br /> The Acting: Mostly Terrible, Nice At The Best. Hearing that most people were apparently volunteers, did not surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> The Dialogue: Many, cheesy, the script comes down as a long version of a few candles you saw in Sunday school or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots reveal in the absence of "meaningless words", but the cold hard truth is that such words are part of the real world, and its complete absence is tangible. Let's just say the average head coach of a team in a state championship game has a lot more to say than "OH NO!" when things don't go their way. <br /> <br /> The plot: mentally predictable. It has been noted that this movie is not a Hollywood clich√©, yet it is as if it was drawn directly to make an Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies) and just " A Christian theme had a layer of paint slaughtered by it. I do not lie or beg if I said I had almost every important detail in both the plot and subplot directly at the beginning. Only someone who has never seen a decent movie in their lives will be emotionally moved by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> Directing / Editing: It was also almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Film template. Nevertheless, there were not many noticeable goofs, so Facing The Giants was technically competent. <br /> <br /> The Message: Ask Jesus and He Will Give All Your Wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team's ultimate defeat to the whole "If we lose, praise you, share" because in the real world you will fail at one point or another. is good to be prepared for it. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, it is clear that someone is either screwing or cheating. Another interesting question is, what if the Eagles came across another team that got religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last minute savings, or would the universe simply explode? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian parents who lament Hollywood's calamity, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre Christian film to hold a pedestal as the preferred model for modern movie-making . For everyone else, the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to look something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show it to non-Christians will not lead to repentance, but to repentance. I give these two stars, one for the one scene that didn't make me roll, and the other for basic technical skills on a low budget.
