NATURAL BILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Track: R <br /> Directors Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> This is an unusual Oliver Stone picture, but as I read he was on drugs during the filming, I didn't need any further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, crazy, all-out movie making we don't get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularized and glorified by the media; There is a wonderful scene where an interviewer asks some teenagers from Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says "Murder is wrong .... but if I was a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes it with a situation of Frankenstein (the monster) and dr. Frankenstein - Dr Frankenstein is the media they have changed in these monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone films investigate the mistakes of America, the country the director loves and admires. I think 'Natural Born Killers' is about the effects of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) about things like mass murderers and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The killers played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are performed surprisingly by two excellent actors who enter the lives of two interesting brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the brutal theory of social Darwinism (survival of the strongest). - Mickey says in his prison interview, that other species are committing fatalities, we as human beings destroy other species and exploit the environment; The writing is interesting, but it is doubtful how much this film constitutes, in the sense of reminding us of society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of a 2-hour massacre we saw. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitude of the governor, etc. Jail overcrowding - perhaps Stone stalls the future, the path that society leads. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who manages a show on 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessive in advancing ratings, goes to some length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, a madman, perhaps sadistic officer who is in Mallory's love. He also has a strange obsession with mass murderers, as his mother was murdered by Charles Whitman during the Waco, Texas massacre. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; The green color that is most visible is green to look after the killer's disease (in the drugstore when looking for rattlesnake antidote). <br /> <br /> The camera work is insane; Shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to use it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" do not glamorize the existence of insane killers, it asks this and how we as the public can burn this feature ... <br /> The above review sounds pretty positive, I didn't like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the screenplay for the film, was not happy with the changed script and asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While it's sometimes interesting, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a photo. <br /> <br /> 4/10
