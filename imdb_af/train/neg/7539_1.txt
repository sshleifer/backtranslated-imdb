Where, where, to begin with describing the widespread misery of Neil LaBute's latest attempt to make film? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fans out there, but by far the most annoying and level is Mr. Intriguing. You know sir, intrusive, or not? <br /> <br /> He's the fellow who doesn't matter how stupid, lame and incomprehensible a movie is. He says, "Give, I don't know why everyone hated it, I found it interesting." He is the kind of guy who finds the smell of canine. Especially when he puts it in the shape of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and rumbles across the house about the brilliance of science fiction containing thin-grained references to Greek mythology. He is also the man who made this version of The Wicker Man. No one else can stand it.
