Burning hall! It is a battle between two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), who can both fire fires spiritually; they squarely over the childhood differences, with dippy love interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the TV kid behind the "Moonlighting") smokes the dark-texted comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with a performance so smooth, the film looks like a recording of an overall film student at a fifteen million award dollar. It has the prickly energy of a great commercial feature, but a formless style that does not protrude from the characters except their cook-like eccentricity. It's not even characters, they are plot features. Rarely released to theaters, the movie is a disaster, but strict as an example of style over fabric it looks good. Winger is the only outing in a role that really looks confused. * 1/2 of ****
