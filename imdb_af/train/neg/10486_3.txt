My main comment on this movie is how Zwick could get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast ?? even for the supporting characters, who do not really help this movie. However, I must admit that Tom Hank's comedy almost made it worthwhile? What was it about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The point of departure is good. Basinger's character, struggling with the existence of a Pink Lady, makes her way to the Las Vegas motel, placing the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens when Corbett's character is on his way to Las Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to him, so he is soon ex-motivated. As they both make their way, they walk in with Elvis imitators heading for an Elvis personalization convention in Vegas. Soon the FBI will get involved and start tracking what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately premise doesn't mean the movie was good. <br /> <br /> Looking at this movie, do you think you're back in the first grade? When story lines and continuity are not really important. It's just great to watch Basinger look pretty in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why she doesn't really make sense. The movie is trying hard, but eventually it falls short. Eventually, it was filled with ideas that could be theoretically funny, but in practice it wasn't funny. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst, but you can find yourself, feel like leaving the building when you look at one ???? Don't say I didn't warn you!
