Awful! Absolutely terrible! No plot, no point, no end. The director seems to have turned the camera on and then the whole crew goes to lunch. Every day. I'm trying to give this video away, but nobody will take it. I give it a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I have to say thumb to this one. <br /> <br />
