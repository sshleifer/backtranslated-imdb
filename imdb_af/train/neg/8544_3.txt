I was never quite sure where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what happens on a mountain. They investigate, have narrowly escaped, left, come back, left, put each other in danger, sleepwalkers, attacked by witches who have consistent cupboards, etc. The guy looks like the girl, but often leaves her unprotected. . She is taken away, he gets her back, leaves her again. You get the point. The whole thing seems to come up with a kind of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure if people change in witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the pressure is so severe that there are times when twenty seconds of blackness are not uncommon. It is caused by age or over-utilization of night filters.
