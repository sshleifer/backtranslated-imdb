Are you joking ?! A show that shows someone opening cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented should you do this? She can cook, but it is NOT portrayed in this half-hour gastric painful production. I know she has a Martha-Stewart esquire empire. So Warren Buffett does, but I don't see him with fake bells opening cans of cream crust and Alpo. <br /> <br /> She called a cousin ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking to anyone who speaks a stupid. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "table-scapes" than real cooking. Who has that kind of time?! Silicone should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This view should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
