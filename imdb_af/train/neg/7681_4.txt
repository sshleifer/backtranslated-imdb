Sean, you know I think you're absolutely the biggest actor in the world, but I can't praise you for that. Comedy just isn't your strong suit. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all your fault though. Some of the things were just too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where the lines come from. <br /> <br /> Again, Sean ... I apologize.
