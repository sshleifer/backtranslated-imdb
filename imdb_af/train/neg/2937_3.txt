An attempt to switch to appeal to those who do not appreciate opera uses the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and best is a recording of Pavarotti that he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who cures his throat that suddenly became troublesome. <br /> <br /> Only because it came out so long ago, it is largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has the presence of his singing talent, and nothing he does in this movie ignores the opinion. His fault is not to reject the terrible script. Maybe because big operas can have stupid stories, he has one patience. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? Should we know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and thin. This movie is like pampering cold mud to pick up some juicy curls (the opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. Just get one of his many beautiful opera or vocal recordings and recognize the master tenor where he fits best. <br /> <br /> It would be one of IMDb's 100 worst movies if more people remembered it and gave it a bit of voice; It will fit neatly into a list that includes several attempts by singers, actors, models and athletes to utilize their popularity through film. Often it goes very wrong because of incompetent work or a terrible writing. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he didn't show such an excellent voice. But effectively, he is an actor (opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved this turkey from a script. <br /> <br /> I give it a polite 3 out of 10 because someone might be a fan of Pavarotti's singing and opera because of this movie.
