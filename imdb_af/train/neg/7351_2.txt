Sometimes you have to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This one will always be in the bad movie category, just because everything except Shu Qi's performance was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel tells of Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief went straight after she left her lover, Chi. Lamb (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But her past returns when Chi Lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software that works for Cat. To save him, she calls on her old friends at her orphanage, six other festive women, to save the day ... <br /> <br /> I may have told the synopsis cute, but it's a cheese story. In fact, the whole writing and direction didn't have any quality at all. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice paper in water. If I could sum it up, take a bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw off the budget, and you have Martial Angels: a formal piece of work without any imagination. <br /> <br /> Remember, I have to give credit where credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who came out of the terrible action, because it was her performance that shone. Okay, you can't say she's excellent - after all, she has absolutely nothing to work with - but she has dug a character out of her role. Unlike that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression - although it was mostly glittering and very short. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the movie just fell into pieces. Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and incredible. Of course, special effects were done on the cheap without trying to clean the edges between people and the mask of the blue screen, poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fighting tones, camera angles that were elementary and unobstructed, and direction I liked better. seen a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was too much coke. Probably the budget was blown away by the over-enthusiasm of having seven babies on the same silver screen. It didn't leave much more. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the way this movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn. Charlie's Angels, it's not. In fact, while sisters can do it for themselves, nothing of this was really clear. <br /> <br /> Definitely one to forget.
