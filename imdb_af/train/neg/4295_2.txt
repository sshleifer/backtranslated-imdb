This is another depressing and boring movie about Aids and tragedies. It starts out very unpredictably and predictably and lasts throughout the movie. I kept waiting to pick it up, but unfortunately it never did. The acting is fair, but the writing needs a lot of work. And if you're looking for nudity, don't waste your time with these not so hot actors. Due to the poor sound quality and the lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five gay movies, or recently gay, you might find this movie interesting, otherwise it's your low-budget movie. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
