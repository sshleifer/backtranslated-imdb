I thought I'd see a scary movie. And finally I laughed throughout the film. In the scene where humans changed to a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget is an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) to Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf. It has good special effects as it should be (human transformation for werewolf). Unless you want a good laugh, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
