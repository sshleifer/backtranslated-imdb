God, I was bored from my head watching this pilot. I expected a lot from that because I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not only since "Titanic", I can add) and his name in the credits I thought would be a quality guarantee. , he also wrote the lease Strange Days.). But the thing failed to grab my attention at any point in its almost two-hour duration. At that time, it hardly went beyond the two synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to find any kind of coherent plot from all the mess of strings going nowhere. In addition, I don't think the acrobatics even obsolete that of a regular A-Team episode. As for Alba, yes, of course she is wonderful, but the fact that she only shows one facial expression is the whole movie (pouty and surly), and also makes me very surprised by her "gal white and attitude". You can get me out of this one, Mr. Cameron, count!
