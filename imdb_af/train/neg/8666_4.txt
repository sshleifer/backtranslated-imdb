This TV-made thriller is all talk, small action. It's hard to set up his complicated plot, but the writing is so confused. The outline is still cloudy at its best. By the end, I no longer knew about these characters as I did at the beginning. It has a quasi-"Ten Little Indians" scenario, but demolishes it halfway in favor of Sally Field and exposes her to a killer. Field overworked here with a grayness that I rarely saw from her. The early introductions are good, but the writing goes down quickly and eventually goes over the top. Many hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which don't add anything). A remarkable failure of producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, can they not give us anything more than a scripts full of red herring and Sally Field hiding in a cupboard?
