Lynch. The man has some very good things! He knows how to disturb us, then rewards us by thinking in different ways. However, it is completely different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by keeping 99% stupidity. I laughed once, but somewhere in episode 4 I just looked forward fast. Didn't miss a thing. I relieved when it ended, and this is part of the point with this series. It's an annoying series of annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded off with annoying animations, voices and sounds. But to admit it and its other absurd qualities, it still fails to make Dumbland worthwhile.
