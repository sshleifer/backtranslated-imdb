It was getting worse, getting worse and by the time the girl had attacked the old lady, I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed and kill the C ** T with it. Avoid this movie, a bit of good cinematography and a few shots, would be almost acceptable if I was 14 and Jenna Jameson didn't see a million times naked. If anyone has the need to watch this movie, I strongly recommend spending the time more appropriately. As an example, I would try to push a Lego house into your bum without lube being a good start. I hear this movie was not the original version, I'd like to see the original, as it looks like this clip version is without any plot, and apparently most of the nudity, please tell me how I can get In contact with Christian Viel, he owes me an hour of my life!
