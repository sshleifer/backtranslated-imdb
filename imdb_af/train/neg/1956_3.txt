This movie has one salvation function. At one point, after a character was attacked by a screaming fairy, his brother asked him, "Why is your dick there, Chuck?" Having almost suffered an hour of bad film, it almost made my drink out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the plays aren't bad, but the kids stink and PJ Soles should be ashamed of herself for making this movie. The story is poor and no one does what you think (or dictates common sense) what they need. <br /> <br /> Of course, there aren't many storytelling points. For example, in one scene, the ghost of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove that they exist, a difficult thing because they seem to be unable to act with physical matter. But minutes later they counted all the branches off the ground and knocked the Tooth together. Apparently they can sometimes move and sometimes they can't. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and guts, though ... some nice boobs. But it doesn't make up for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's good, but many other reviewers don't share my opinion. At least it puts a mood.
