This film could be a good idea, a mummified 2000-year-old witch and totally destroyed it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry out. They will stay with her Nan and Oom. The uncle discovered a 2000-year-old witch kept in the peat. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. She can't be conventionally murdered (more is sorry). However, Nora does a way to do this. <br /> <br /> This is a Gothic horror movie done on the cheap. It's a turbulent mess. I have to ask why someone wants to make such a bad movie. I am tempted to learn witchcraft to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> MAKE ALL COSTS
