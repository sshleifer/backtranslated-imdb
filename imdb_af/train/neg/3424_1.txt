You've never seen a movie yet and still know The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How did it do," because if you throw someone and tell them that they are making a movie, they will do it. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, "Why, oh, why, did Steve Martin allow it to be made?" I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined to cost nothing. He knew the successor would be so frightening that he would not even count royalties as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel cannot be embarrassed is to revive Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin's favorite arm black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparent that you worked on this movie in a sad capacity. The only way you can feel better about your involvement is to comment on the sequel's lonely cheerleader as an IMDb user. I begged you to go into satire, but unfortunately, you really made an effort to turn. Why not 10 stars?
