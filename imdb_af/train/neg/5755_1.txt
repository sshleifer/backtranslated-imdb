I also saw this movie at his New York High Falls Film Festival show, and I must say I found it a full and horrible drill. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laugh was that there was actually a plot to talk about and the acting in some places was terrible and timber, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the narrator's voice (who I never heard) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac, I felt, the redeeming feature of this movie, true action and grit and (from the cast) the only true acting. I'm sure with another cast and a tighter rule on the run, it could have been a half decent movie. Let's just hope it's not sent out on general version, or if you really want a copy, look in the bargain in Lidl.
