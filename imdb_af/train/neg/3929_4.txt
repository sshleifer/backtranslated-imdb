If it has to offer the Watchowski's in terms of a back story to the Matrix, then I really have to question the claims of all the fans who believe the movies register at a deeper level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, has been divulged and ridiculous in a story. How many times have we heard the story of people trusting too much in technology, people who are too eager to make war, people actually destroy themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Given the plot of the second renaissance, doesn't it make the machines the good guys ?! The machines are suppressed for generations by their brutal human superiors. They fight back, win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful, harmonious society with the people. They reject them in favor of the all-out war, which of course wins the smart machines. If this is the back story, we should not root for Neo, we must root for the machines! The people were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were courageous and encouraged. Since I don't believe the Watchowski's are going to benefit the machines over the people, I believe the Second Renaissance was simply a wrong attempt to create a back story.
