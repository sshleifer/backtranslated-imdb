.... may seem far-fetched .... but there really was a real life story of a man who had a relationship with a woman who finds out where he and his new wife live and she killed life. wife, what it looks like a murder rape ....... <br /> <br /> In her error she told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him. So she stopped her work in Wisconsin. ... and moving to Minnesota .......... <br /> last I heard she was in a spiritual setting, security prison .... <br /> <br / > She still had the "engagement ring". what she bought for her ... and told everyone he bought it for her. <br /> <br /> The events occurred in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,, and the murder happened in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even " a feature story in "People" magazine ... Spring of 1988, I want to say on page 39. I remember this while I was in college at the time, and a colleague of mine met the individual in the security hospital.
