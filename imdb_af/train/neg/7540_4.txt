The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is not a good movie at all, but I can't really say it's one I regret. I can continue with the negative aspects of the movie, such as the horrific acting and the long scene where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence - with a hallucination. ., but it's just not worth living if it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should watch The Wicker Man, even though it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that it has some creepy ideas about it. The only problem is in his cute, unintentional, funny performance. If nothing else, it's a movie that can inspire you to watch the original 1973 movie, or even read the short story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For a cheese-like horror / thriller, it's really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it's filmed in place instead of using green screen or extended sets so we can see some very nice views. There are also very nice composite shots. It's a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor, because he is a force of nature. Whether you are a fan of him or not, it seems like Cage is unable to play an "ordinary man". There is always a kind of eccentricity or humility that he brings to the characters he plays, and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is big or dreadful, always brings his unique energy to the game, and he is never boring to watch. He's horrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student can probably write a whole paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. "See?" You can write, "That's what happens when women are allowed to run a society!" Also, the similarities between this "Summersisle" society and a secondary colony are quite interesting and remarkable. <br /> <br /> 1. If you read it, there is probably a good chance that you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of highlights from the movie, including Cage which walk around in a bear suit and of course the infamous "AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYE !!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are quite pretty funny as they see it in the film's whole. <br /> <br /> I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you do, it's about a dollar a reason. That's a good thing. <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE: The Unrated movie version is best to watch, and it is better to see the Theatrical version just for its little add on the epilogue, which contains a James cameo . Franco.
