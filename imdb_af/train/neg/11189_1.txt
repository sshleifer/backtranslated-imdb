Always enjoy good movies dealing with the super-natural and deep thoughts of the Spiritual world. However, this film just turned me away from production and direction. There is nothing to talk deeply about what this story should tell; All I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, delivered an excellent performance in his native England, and we saw him in a TV show. Heath Ledger plays the real evil man and we recently saw him in Brokeback Mountain, 05. He played a major supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a good job of deceiving a priest from a church that was not recognized by any faith. Don't waste your time, you'll be sorry!
