I can't believe this movie was ever created. I think the director is trying to make it an artistic piece, but it just makes it worse. The zombies look like they have applied too many eye-catches. The zombies are only a few minutes in the movie. Finally, there may be five or six zombies altogether, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if any, is definitely the credits because the painful experience is finally completed. Again to repeat other users' comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who doesn't make sense at all. It is never explained.
