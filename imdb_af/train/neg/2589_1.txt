For those with little time on their hands, I'll summarize it quickly, in one word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this movie fits perfectly with the description. So much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing anything completely stupid and unnecessary for you. Want a completely naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason she looks is so useless even though it really is the tone for the rest of this little shit. You can almost take a look at the deceptive thoughts of the 12-year-old boys who wrote this piece of garbage just by looking at this shit they expect the public to actually pay! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've watched a lot of movie franchise but American Pie; Beta House should be one of the worst offenders if you think that despite the average nature of the original movie, it's still a thousand times harder than this drink. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you actually feel you are watching a school game. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of incredible suspension to actually see it (we're talking Star Wars suspension levels, like the kind you need to convince yourself Jar Jar is actually) <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is paper thin and most of the time, the events that look there are just there to show a few more breasts or another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent to talk about, all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail !!!! Every bunch fell flat and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unaware the writers wrote. How else can you explain the bulls? They are trying to go out as a story. <br /> <br /> They pass every opportunity to do something that is valuable and entertaining in favor of poorly written, lowest common denominator nonsense. The characters have to complete a number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House, but it is mostly handled by a series of very short settings, which implies that they complete the tasks, but we see little or no evidence of this actually happening. It's a very lazy way to tell a story. It also misses opportunities to be funny. (Imagine the wizard of Oz, where all the important events took place instead, and everything we see is Dorothy, who gets up the scarecrow every time, and says, "Give it. That was probably a great adventure. what we just had. ") Lazy. Lui. LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> The female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is getting naked without a clear reason and is used by most of the movies as visual props. You brainedads who are just looking for T&A will not be disappointed, but that is why you are ashamed. If you buy it on DVD, you will contribute to the downfall of society in your own special way. Congratulations.
