It wasn't funny in 1972. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I'm not bashing the movie because it's incredibly sexist - I enjoy it, or rather enjoy the reaction it gets in annoying PC people . I bases this because it is poorly written and performed. <br /> <br /> The only memorable character is Blakey, who will recognize British people 25 years old as he has long been a favorite with Impressionists. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
