This movie was so terrible it was almost good ... almost. We love musical, but not this. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to deliver a good performance (especially at the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was also nice to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheesy piano music. Eventually, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a funny movie to watch just because it's awful! We think it could be a good stage music (with excellent actors).
