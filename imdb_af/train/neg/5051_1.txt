I am both amused and frightened by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and there never was. This movie is about as true to the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beat is true of ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and have) happened, but in general the people are just like you and me. They have morals, they don't kill machines, they don't all do drugs. Violence was the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened much more often than what the "hype" would make you believe. Oliver Stone has made an effort to make films showing the Vietnam War as this brutal massacre, but is so much based on Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: The Viet Cong and NVA have done far worse things about South Vietnam than any soldier in the US armed forces ever did. Fact: World War II soldiers treated the enemy much worse than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were welcomed when they got home. The good Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war was fought from a political point of view, none of our soldiers could have asked for more, and it is a great distraction to claim that this kind of "mostly true" fiction is the way things really were.
