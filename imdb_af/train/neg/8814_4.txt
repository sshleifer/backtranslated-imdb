This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The pace and editing is a perfect introduction to an ensemble piece, even better than Gosford Park. Then it becomes inexplicably delayed, loses focus and begins like a traditional French movie, only to eventually regain the focus with the love affair between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many margins and loose points in the story. Several threads that have started are not terminated. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cecile. He has been faithful to her for many years after his relationship with her many years ago, despite her repetition and home in Morocco. As a builder, he is now restoring his own life and restoring her by taking Cecile's mask. After reaching it, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. He only wakes up after she burns their old picture as an indication that they have reconciled with the past and can start their lives together again. ******* END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is unclear what vision this director wants us to see because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are regular radio broadcasts on the overthrow of the former Iraqi regime. Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) as soon as he meets his boyfriend, while the girl he lives in appears to be sick (of that?). Her sister is traditionally Islamic, and enters into a relationship with Cécile's husband. It depicts Morocco as unnecessarily backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through it, which almost glorifies the past. It depicts Islam as backward and susceptible to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end it can best be described as adding a few couleur locale and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are wonderful. With this material, they are so well-known that they can exchange something extra at every stage: an eyebrow, body language, proud pride, uncomfortable behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of the French film in the world. Of course, with some notable exceptions.
