OK, if you are looking for another Bastketball diary, this is completely the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> I'm turning to two brothers. Max, the younger, has a great cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is supposed to show the dive of reality to the extreme lows that make drugs possible. However, this is not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation is. Most of the film focuses on Max and his secretive ways. Eventually, Adam can no longer reduce the stress of his work and begins to use it (perception of drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has virtually no climax. Don't get rid of what cocaine really does to you, have boring and low budget contexts, and the acting of the oldest brother, Adam, is terrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie has passed. To succeed and receive awards, this is not a heart-addict. If you want a clear and true storyline on the extreme world of drug rentals, don't buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you'll enjoy it. Try to see yourself ...
