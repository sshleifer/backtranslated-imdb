The creativity of this movie was lost from the beginning when the authors and directors left a good story line, but only to surprise with terrific special effects. This movie focused on amusing kids but couldn't even reach it. Many small low-budget movies have the potential to become big movies, but this movie is not close. Fortunately, it will be another movie that is easy to make and easily forgotten. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to put some money down until their opportunity came for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a look of respect for movies should avoid seeing this movie at all costs.
