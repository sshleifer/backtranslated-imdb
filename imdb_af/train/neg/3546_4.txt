Spoilers ahead - go on your own. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie is that, as soon as Harry learns the identities of the three scammers - with relative ease - he still holds their claims. And then the whole scene with his wife decides to be kidnapped, he decides to explode his classic car (with the money in it), which makes us a pretty big leap of logic. <br /> <br /> Good, so he wanted to keep his relationship with Cini out of the public eye because of his wife's involvement in the DA campaign. I can see that, but why don't you put someone around to kill or even kill these villages after he has determined there was no real blackmail (eg Cini's body?). nice interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it. Then it's kind of falling apart.
