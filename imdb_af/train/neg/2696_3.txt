I know John Singleton is a smart guy he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write it? It's like a bad pilot "for the first time to college" soap soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some free violence being thrown in to make it a commercial proposal. Who would have guessed that the victim would shower victims for seafood? The evil loner will be premeditated by a group of neo-Nazis (and will be with a black and a Jew - just for the laugh!) Even Laurence Fishburne's creepy reactionary history Professor just irritated me and I love the old man, like everyone involved in this movie, the plot just lost. Besides Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.
