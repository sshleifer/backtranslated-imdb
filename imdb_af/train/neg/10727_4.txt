The movie is worth just watching if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with funny conversations in a bar and lets you expect a good, funny story. Well, I can tell you it won't come. It will be exacerbated in minutes in a movie that challenges your patience, as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extent that you probably won't be happy to witness. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director in this movie wanted to express the sense of a loss of identity which he felt was the majority of people in this globalizing world. I was surprised to hear it. Do I live in the same world where he lives? OK, many people walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and everything, but it doesn't make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are no more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Am I short-sighted or is he? <br /> <br /> Well my voice: the good start of the movie saves it to get a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
