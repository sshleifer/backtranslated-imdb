The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's good. It didn't fall flat. The next best thing is the supporting actions of the actor who plays fiery groom Edwards, the always wonderful Holland Taylor, and the actor who plays Taylor's husband. The actor helps criticize Messing's potential outfits in an early stage, bringing a beautiful, absurd quality to the proceedings. All right, it's positive about it. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I worship, is far more credible that expresses contempt for Brass than in any scene where he tries to be or support business. As others have noted, it seems that he has no emotional investment in this business, but packs it up as soon as possible. Brass, on the other hand, tries to carry the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is enough to do this, but is simply not strong enough to help an actress do it all without help. Give her an "E" for effort and a "C +" for performance. Given Mulroney's indifference, the one thing that Brass could have helped would be a brilliant cavalier Irons-esquire performance by the actor who played her former fiancee, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance was poorly knotted, mewring and vockless. <br /> <br /> Of course, if I try to analyze this one, I will pay more attention to most people. It is harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less silly (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you are much better off looking again at "My Best Friend's Wedding".
