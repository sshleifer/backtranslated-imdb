- = contains spoiler of both original and movie versions = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre Dame De Paris musical, I also read book this summer and I watched today, in the beginning I was hopeful to see a good movie, especially if I saw 6.3 IMDb point. First screens were good, but I actually waited for the theater center directly from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kissed, I felt something was wrong. They don't even kiss in the book, even in musical. <br /> <br /> And there was a big gap why Esmeralda was judged by wizard. In the book she teaches her buck how to react clock or write word "phoebus". wait there was a phoebus not there? In this movie he is nothing more than a soldier, the creators made Quasimodo's love to show around and even canceled Frollo's love. But Notre Dame was Frollo. His thoughts are his struggle between the love of God and the love of man in the movie we can find nothing, all we have is a villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts are .. and do not mention Phoebus, and call love of Frollo, not called Jehan (Frollo's brother), call mother of Esmeralda (perhaps it is OK, the storyline would have cut a lot) they did not even call the true story. (Another PS: Frollo was not an opus day or a few non-cultist, he is actually interested in alchemy. He tries to make gold. He was stuck in science and religion. <br /> <br /> Finally do not look at this movie, it is a kind of director's edition to real masterpiece, and if you watched it before reading the book, God has mercy on you, you should read immediately to discuss. <br /> <br / > This movie is worse than Notre Dame II's animated movie, spending your time watching Notre Dame De Paris musical .. enough said ..
