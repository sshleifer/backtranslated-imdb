presumably based on the life of Domino Harvey, a model bounty hunter has become. I'd say 95% was manufactured. I always like the role of movies, but this movie lost its chances when it became clear that the story was interpreted throughout the movie, something I can't stand, and to take it off, the heroine is of the story as hateful and portrayed as an arrogant b! I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head. It's too incoherent, too flashy and boring, it's a narrative story and I really think the big time directors should make their own or a writer's own imagination. Not something based on some ignorant snobbers. .
