Repetition: Full Moon. A being, a great werewolf, is on the hunt. Not for flesh, not for blood (not that it is wise to take a little way), but for a mate. He's on the hunt for a girl. Not any girl. The girl. The girl who is pure (and also a werewolf, although she doesn't know it yet). Three, make sure, two policemen (after the first scene) and an old lady are all that can stop it, or even know that the thing that many adult people kill and eat is a werewolf. This particularly powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, enters the girl. If he gets her, mankind is doomed. Now the police have to find the girl, not only convince her that there is someone, a werewolf who wants to rape her and maybe kill her, but that she herself is a werewolf. And then they must stop him ... <br /> <br /> Comment: It's one for the boys, the teenagers. Many scenes with semi-nude girls are more or less important for the plot. Usually less. Well, I think you need something to fill a little time, because the plot is (expected) thin. And unfortunately there are few except the girls to help break the plot. One usually turns to two main themes. Nudity. Cheque. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are a few things you can call effects. However, they are not very special. In fact, they are very bad. The movie looks like there's a shortage of funds. They couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls;) and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, which of course are done by the computer, are really bad. You may think of such things. But the Dark Wolf itself is also very rough and you never get murder. Just a few crippled bodies afterwards. And there is little blood left in a movie that must be honest in blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most of the times they do well, but unfortunately there are dilapidated where the characters (or actors) just lose it. Some of these dilemmas may be related to the problems mentioned above. Like the poor bonds, or the poor budget (?). This can explain why there are precious little shootings, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in the naked eye (and not moving). But hey, if you're in real danger, there's nothing that will save your life like a good one-liner. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this can't explain the moment when the Cop, Steve, is the only one who knows how to handle the problem, the werewolf is gone, as the only thing he's sure is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is just next to him and that he can't let it have her. But surely, this makes the makers stretch the end of a little more ... <br /> <br /> But I won't mind that none of the lead actors / actresses try another in another movie. <br /> Well. To give a small conclusion: Not a movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
