After 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock. The story is taken from big movies like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills has Eyes". I like that kind of movies, even if they are duplicated well (wrong turn, wood error, carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to see: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and completely misplaced. You don't care what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical. So how's the blood and gore? Well, there are a few, although it is reasonably cheap and the action is very poorly executed. 2 points, just for the gore and blood, but understand that it is almost not worth it, even for the Gore-Hounds.
