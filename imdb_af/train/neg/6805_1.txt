I'm ready to see the movie 10 minutes ago. Wow, I still can't believe what I watched. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely the worst movie ever. If I list all the errors in the movie, this review will take me a lot of sentences. (Very funny mistakes, because it's so bad) <br /> <br /> You must be amazed at the skill of the commandos assigned to save the plane. they didn't even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice is such a bad actor ... and the thing I don't understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero. <br /> <br /> Of course, the big mistakes will be the landing of a 747, which only needs 3 or 4 tips from a man in the transfer to land the plane ... amazing. as well as the dead who had almost no blood. <br /> <br /> But I strongly recommend watching this movie as it is very interesting to see how bad things can get
