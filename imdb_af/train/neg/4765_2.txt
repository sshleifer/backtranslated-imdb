While the original testifies to the intellect, this inexpensive remake is designed to shock the sensitivity. Instead of intricate plot-twists, these so-called thriller only features sudden and seemingly random story changes that only serve to evade it further with every bizarre development. Worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialogue, is a reshaped southaker full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving a sharp but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was promise - unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine writing a spicy Duke-like Keller-to-Sullivan graduation ceremony is intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor first disregarded his reputation, first by accepting the role in these horrific re-scripted nonsense and then turning into a show that just seems competent compared to Jude Law's amateur persecution. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the classic original, look at its dated visual and gimmicks. Hunt it down, watch it, and just enjoy a story-and-a-half. As for the remake, give this insult to the original.
