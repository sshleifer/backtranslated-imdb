The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a spiritual institution after she starts believing she is actually a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-son, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you read it, you probably know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But "I'm a Cyborg ..." is a great departure from familiar, and (unfortunately) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any movie or story trying to do something else. God knows, we are all subject to enough shit at our local theaters. The main point of the movie I have to say is that it says nothing about mental illness, or creates characters you care about. <br /> <br /> This story has to be one of the strangest things I've seen in years ... but strange is not enough. There is no heart for the movie ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it is Chan-wook Park itself that seems to be the most confused of them all.
