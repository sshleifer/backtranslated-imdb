I think bad Laurel and Hardy are better than no Laurel and Hardy, but only scarce. It's sad that the Fox movies are exposed to those who get a big release on DVD to people who may no longer be familiar with L&H for their WORST stuff, rather than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again the boys are sown. with a silly romantic plot about a man who invented an invisible ray. He's in love with the boss's daughter, who hates and prefers to be a nice man. It's incredible to think of the geniuses at Fox. THIS is what L&H needs in their movies. <br /> <br /> Without their pancake decoration, the boys look tired and old. The only scene that works for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the bizarre scene where Robert Mitchum, a classic noir bad man, Oliver Hardy's assurance on Stan sells. br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget about it and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Boys of the Desert" instead.
