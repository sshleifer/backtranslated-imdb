Reading the box at the video store, this movie looks rather amusing disturbance. You know the type .... funny but supposed to scare you .... it wasn't funny or horrible. The writing was lame. The jokes did not allow me to even laugh at me. I was so expected. the actors didn't even do much with such a non-good script ... at least I hope it wasn't their best ... look at this movie at your own risk ...... I give it negative 3 stars out of 10
