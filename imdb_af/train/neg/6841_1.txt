I hear rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrating the Blu-ray Disc". With progress over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvested. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth through the entire Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Betamax video" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. After the provisional "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrate the Compact Cassette" and the straight sticky "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrate the 8-Track Tape", what would have been such a glorious piece of cinema? I just cried thinking about it.
