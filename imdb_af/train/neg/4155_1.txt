OK, I knew it would be an F movie (behind the B movie standards), and I thought, "Man, I can use a good laugh, so let's see some kidneys murder each other." Well, what I got could be found at your local "love goods" store. Casual lesbian scenes, very few battles, and no plot. For example, one place in particular I remember (just for his sheer stupidity, I saw better pornography on ABC), where are the two predominantly characters (I can't remember their names ... big movie, huh?) , as they usually did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopping: <br /> <br /> Manager: "Let's get over, I'm tired. You want to take over?" Passenger: "Sure, I can drive for a while. "(As soon as it has covered, the driver begins to grab the passengers' boobs.) Passenger:" What are you doing? I'm not like that! "Manager:" It's OK, everybody does it somewhere. "Passenger:" OK then. "(Continue to dress, love, kiss and perform shirts) <br /> <br /> Now, when I checked in, horror movies were not in the porn video section of Hollywood Video (unless you were involved in S & M you were going elsewhere), and it should definitely not be in the mainstream videos at Blockbuster Do not misunderstand me, I am definitely not one of the people who hate pornography, but I only see it when it is appropriate and certainly do not want to see it when I am looking for a movie in the mainstream stores. not, as this one I rented was one of the two retailers I mentioned (and probably also on the other hand if I was going to look). <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever, nobody should It does not rent, and it should only be bought for a public ceremony, if I could give it a 0, I would, but I can only give it a * of 10.
