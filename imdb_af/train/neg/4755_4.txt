I thought the movie was good in parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie was good. The camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and I didn't like it because they didn't completely cover the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie wasn't really that good, of which we expected a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> The dialogues didn't make sense and I didn't think they were very greasy. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies like phonebooth in terms of dialogs, but failed. It seemed like they were many of the scenes between the actors for the sake of it and made no sense for the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has only law and caine. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was a waste. of time, it's an OK movie, but not gr8
