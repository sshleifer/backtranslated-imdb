Autobiography of the founder of the zoo in NYC begins by being very cute and would be a good family movie if it stayed there. but we are becoming more and more involved in reality, as gorilla grows to be a wild thing that cannot easily be for his "mother's" wishes. It can be younger children, especially. scenes where Buddy Gertrude tries to hurt. Another quick fix at the end. below average.
