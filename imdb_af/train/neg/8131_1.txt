Unless the title is supposed to be a kind of spud for the woman's transformation (the enemies ruin it). Anyway, if this movie wasn't Made-For-TV, it should have been. It's so remarkably low budget, endorsed, underestimated and hit every 70's, except disco. No one is likeable, and you can be indifferent to someone in this one. Eminent forgotten, except for the bad, bad performances.
