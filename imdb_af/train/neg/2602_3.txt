Drew Barrymore sees her alter-ego across the city and it really starts to hurt her. <br /> <br /> After hiring a hack writer apartment, Dee meets more often with "the other Drew". Author dude feels that it is his responsibility to "get the right Drew" out of her fool so he does what he can to help seduce her as soon as he has free time. Not very interesting, and even less frightening, but Drew is usually sexy, especially when she gives a group of rude builders the finger ... yes, it's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene may be where Drew is real life. Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
