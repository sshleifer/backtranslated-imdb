I don't agree with the previous comment and side with Maltin on this one. It is a second-rate, excessively ominous Western who cracks and tries to sit down over the central theme of the Wild West that is tied and kicked through the steady time of the time. It would be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", but lacking in the film's poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen's direction is limp, and the last 30 minutes or so is a real blast, with an incomprehensible strategy by heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a holler if you can explain why they set fire to the hill.) There was something unceasing about the entire treatment of the rape zone, and the woman's response certainly didn't come true. Coburn is very nasty as the half race escapes, but all his co-escapes are underdeveloped (they are like a bowling ball to beat one by one while the story is leaping forward). Michael Parks gives one of his typical fleeting, lethal, mumbling actions, but in this case it was fitting because his modern style commander symbolizes the complacency that technological advancement can bring.
