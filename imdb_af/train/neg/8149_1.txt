What an absolute pile of pants. After reading Chris Brookmyre's books religiously, as I came across "Totally Ugly", I was delighted to find out that this drama was being commissioned. <br /> <br /> Of course, I had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he's not quite fit. How someone can read the book and adapt it to this piece of foam is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The whole characters are changing, situations are dropped and Parlablane's dramatic hacking is reduced to Nesbitt who knows a Quick and opens a bay window. It brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think what will happen to "Country Of The Blind" if it's the benchmark ... <br /> <br /> Please, avoid it ...
