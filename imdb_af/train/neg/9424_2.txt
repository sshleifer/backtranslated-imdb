It wasn't nice to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) Just so that his stepson can go to the film school, but his stepson decides that he will make a humiliating documentary about the man. A documentary filmmaker needs to show the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The purpose seems to be Frank foolish and pathetic. Instead, he comes across as the most human of the 3 people. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a smear campaign that puts everything as something is much smarter and more noble than it really is. It left me with an intense aversion to the filmmaker.
