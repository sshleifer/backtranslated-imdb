A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50's and that he now has the power to ... burst into flames! <br /> <br /> I was really ready for this movie, directed by the great Toby Hooper and the star wildlife chart Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the average individual-violent-power movie. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting starting point for that. Unfortunately, it never seems to endure its potential and increases its plot too much. However, the special effects are not bad and help to bring the film to the final. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, no classic, but it's not the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
