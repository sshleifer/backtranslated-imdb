This movie could have been so much better with a dissertation. Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies, but you would think even the homeless and urban resident Jack Mason would ask why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And when the hunting ground is reached, the poor Ice-T plays his part as if he were actually going to lead these men through wood. He has never been seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie is based on Richard Connell's short story "The Dangerous Game." A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after reading the story. I edited the movie, cut out all the senseless scenes and all the curse. It was 43 minutes long.
