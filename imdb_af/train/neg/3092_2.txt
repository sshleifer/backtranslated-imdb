As movies like Ghoulies Gremlins cut off, Hobgoblins sink to the new layers of litter like Ghoulies. These scarcely animated furbies have a kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which mainly concerns characters' sex dreams - oh joy), but what has to do with something is someone's guess, except to let the director abandon his kinky love for eroticism. They show it in the 8th circle of hell, one suspects. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and poor attempts at humor and a gentle attempt to wake the viewer.
