My first idea of ​​how bad it would be was when the video case said it was the people who brought us our Blair Witch Project. It was a masterpiece compared to this piece of garbage. The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot, as it was, is predictable, boring and unwise. 85% of the writing is four letter words and countless variations on them. Mother F seems to be the "author's" favorite because it is constantly being used. It must have been taken 10 minutes to write this script in a few dives at the last call. Thanks, I hired it and could jump it fast. Don't waste your time or money with it.
