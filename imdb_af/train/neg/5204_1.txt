"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be recruited at lirieke.com. They do not have a talent to act in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There is more walking around than in all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour I started reading a Porsche brochure while watching the "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I want to give the movie 0 stars out of 10, as this is not possible, I must give 1 star.
