The idea of ​​In the Name of the People is good, a killer does not want his only daughter to be in an institution and asks the girl's parents who he murdered to take care of his daughter. And you can expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do good work, unfortunately they don't! In the Name of the People the regular Friday night seems to be tearjerker. The flashbacks of the girl killed are pretty pathetic and you can only predict what the actors will say. If you want to watch a good movie on this topic, watch Dean Man Walking!
