It can be a bit difficult for me to say this, but unfortunately so far in his direct career it is true. Just look at what he has done so far. They barely make it past the 3 star point. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance wearing the whole movie. I hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the bigger league of actors, she clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive, typical TV acting. <br /> <br /> The movie is strangely categorized as a horror. The only "horror" is short flashes and they hold a maximum of 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. I personally call this a "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> No matter how interesting the story really is, bad directing, editing and acting (appart from Lucy) destroy it. You get no real bond with the actors, something that is very important in a story like this. You just sit there and look nothing to feel. It's like watching a bad TV soap .... actually, I think the TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better, just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with.
