I think it's pretty safe to say it's the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew of the second one that it would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but I somehow dragged it through to see some friends, I went to the cinema with low expectations, but I was hoping there would be some cheap laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film face a wreath. They mostly consist of people who hit hits on the face and balls, the baby looks slender and acts like a horny gangsta and the typical racial jokes we see so often in today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. I never want to see this **** movie again, but I'd rather take a bullet than ever to be exposed to this piece of fuckwood again. If someone I see says they have it, I will physically face them
