There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad this movie is. It is a pity I actually put this movie, this very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong with that? Acting: There is not even one achievement that is even close to being subparent (at least it is very beautiful). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get Orgy on the soundtrack, everyone will know they're watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (Score): Good, but someone with a keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. Don't even start me on the "What the hell?" moments, here are some: killer can move at the speed of light - turning open actress, no one is there, turning back, there is something in front of her. From now on, the killer appears with a power drill, a very big one! The filmmakers get points at least to put it in, but I can really believe the killer took the time to find the power to plug it in. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and want to say "Where do you get the drill?". I can keep on how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words. I'll give these two out of ten stars. One star to make me laugh and another star for all the fuss. Don't waste your time with this one.
