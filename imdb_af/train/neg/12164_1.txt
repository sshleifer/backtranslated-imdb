this movie is not good. The first one almost sucked, but it ended up unreal to make it worth it. It's nothing, it's zero scared, zero voltage or voltage. It's not really a horror movie. don't show anything. There is nothing to talk about. It can be almost a TV, except for a little nudity and some violence. The acting is also not very good. And don't start me at the dialogue.as for the surprise ending, surprise, there isn't one. I think it could have been worse, though I didn't see how. But again, it's less than 80 minutes long, so I think it's a good thing. although it felt much longer. apparently this is the cut version of the movie. I found it for a very cheap price, but it's not worth it yet. If you want the graphic version of the Unknown Bay, check out the Anchor Bay edition. This version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unlucky Campers gets a big fat 1/10 of me. Looking at this movie, you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper. If you're a real fan, you can pick up Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp (with survival box). Three slideshows contain the first three movies uncut and with special features
