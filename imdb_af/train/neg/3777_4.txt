Flat, supple computing on less than astonishing backgrounds, makes a terribly predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing surprise you, you can even say when the Bryan Adams fever is coming in, which is always in the right time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, becomes a nasty voice when he tells what is happening. However, the narrative is not necessary, since everything happens, is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, though everything they do is close. It will be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for grief, one for laugh, etc. There is no difference between the voices of the horses. <br /> <br /> Young children may like this movie, though. It's nice enough for a family to sit and watch, and there is little danger that someone will be scared. If you have nothing else to do, and want to watch a movie with your kids, it's not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> Otherwise it is not recommended.
