Now I had the best intentions when I looked at this one. I like Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine said it was a good movie, although I heard differently from other people. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott tried too hard. All this was just too much. Allow me to expand. <br /> <br /> Miss. Knightley was too much, and not in a good way. The people who did well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just couldn't save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes jumping into their originality, but somehow they felt they were written by someone other than the lead author. A certain song was used about 4 times, which after the second time really started sticking out. I'm a regular believer not to use the same song more than once. <br /> <br /> The editing also really started on this one, as the cut rate is quite high. Oh, and the repetitive echo of some of Keira's lines just sounds odd after hearing it for the second, third, and fourth time. <br /> <br /> I basically believe that if you want to see an action movie that is highly and a little funny and you don't care about everything I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> (On a synoot: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
