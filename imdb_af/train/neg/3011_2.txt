I was very excited to see this movie, overlooking a visual excursion on the relationship of artistic beauty and nature, which contains the kinds of wisdom such as "Rivers and Tides." However, this is not what I received. Instead, I get a pretty uninspired movie about how human industry is bad for nature. This is clearly a rather unorthodox claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer looks inconsistent with the aesthetics of his images and the supposed "ethical" duty he sometimes has to give the workers to the images along the periphery. And honestly, the images were generally not so impressive. And according to this "artist" scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all respects, a silly movie. For people who want to feel better about their environmental awareness ... but not for someone who wants to think about the complexity of the issues surrounding it.
