I have the DVD very cheap and I'm a total Drewbie, and that's probably the only constellation where this movie can ever interest anyone. <br /> <br /> A Drew movie, she looks good and she gets pretty many cute scenes from her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, a lot of sexy outfits, etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know of her more recent movies. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more looks like it's made for the TV than one for the theater. There is no real terror or tension built up and the dialogues are often cheese. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end because I don't understand it honestly. But maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you don't get the end you expect, and it also comes much quicker than you expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
