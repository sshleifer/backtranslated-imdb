I run a group to stop comedian exploitation and I have only spent the past two months hearing stories of comedians trying to audition for, "Last Comic Standing." If they do not have a GOOD agent, they do not even get a chance to audition, as more than 80% of the comedians arriving are rejected before they can show their talent! If they make it to an audition, I'm told it's "upfront" if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees is NOT the best comics in the US. <br /> <br /> If the cartoons make it to the show, most of them don't get IMDb credits. I know this because I've done the credits for all 6 seasons, "Last Strip Standing" and I'm not paid to do the producers' work. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked, "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook, why the producers don't give IMDb credits and I'm banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I don't have a personal interest in it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to exploit anyone and therefore I helped the comedians. Comedians are exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIG THREE network so those in charge are ashamed to make this exploitation happen. <br /> <br /> Please check out this video of a comedian who is victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
