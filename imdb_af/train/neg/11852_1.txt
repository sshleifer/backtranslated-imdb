This movie had to depict a 'baby's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle for ever. However, I didn't care about his mission to settle, because I didn't care about his character. I don't understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He had to have at least a way to make himself that made ladies weak in the knees, except that his saxophone played, but to no avail. Just because he's a musician doesn't make him sexy. However, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman fell in love with a five-minute team to know she was absolutely shameful and ridiculous. Does this man have what shame? If he had cleared up and stopped doing and saying stupid things, he would be more attractive than a character, but unfortunately his character was vague and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She could just as easily have been an incessant out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice as a poor British accent that would sometimes disappear through the film. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I took care of were the fish and frog. Now the two had chemistry! Academy nominations for both? STAT! Plotgate, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a waste of a movie.
