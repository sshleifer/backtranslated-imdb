I don't know who has the idea that hurricanes are going to kill and kill people and destroy things, but my god is absurd. Hurricanes are definitely not the cold-blooded killer, this movie makes them out to be ... she's stupid. Hurricanes are extremely intelligent, don't get me wrong, but I doubt they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I have to say everything I got from this movie was the entertainment of how far-reaching it was. So at least I was amused by that. Personally I would recommend going to see Jaws if you want to see a movie of Animal-Killing-Humans. But if you are like me and want to laugh at something far from realism, then I want to say go on. : D
