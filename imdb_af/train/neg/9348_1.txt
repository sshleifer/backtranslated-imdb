I came to watch this movie. I felt that it shifted the storyline in my throat as if I couldn't pick up the subtleties, I needed a voice to always spell them out. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is another alcoholic, I really didn't feel it's a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people in my opinion, of course. They find it difficult to communicate, something that the main character had no problem, except that he had a problem that I loved at one point from you - which was a bit of a hassle to establish his cold character. He was constantly surrounded with people too! <br /> <br /> I felt we hadn't cheated at all, we were really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and unrest. I couldn't connect with the character and didn't have a link at all, considering my dad. I felt nothing when it was finished, only relief was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but not a tough guy leader! The orange clockwork was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, had three different characters or avoided the teenage stage and concentrated on the mature McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note I felt the little actor was really good at the start of the movie !!
