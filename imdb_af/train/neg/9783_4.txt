Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly not very good. I am a paintball player myself, playing a lot of airball and going to the airball from the bush is quite a big change. The film portrays similar quality. First, the movie starts with this team who are apparently trying to shoot this "Phantom" man or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shooting mags, autocockers. A man sporting a bush. Not much wrong with the movie, but more how it was observed was very cheesy. A lot of kids who are good guys are wooden players who don't have much money and have dreams of getting better guns. Another team is constantly pushing them and insulting them because they play bush and blah blah. The phantom helps these bush players and exercises them and all this shit, he gets them to play air ball and basically saves all the teams, including the "professional". <br /> <br /> So what's really wrong with the movie? Well, the budget is a big thing, a paintball movie won't be bad, but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it's done by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the play is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is also bad. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speed ball and all this other crap. It was, in my opinion, just a bad movie and does not give a real perception of paintball. To be honest, true paintball is not all friendly, it's a lot of cussing and bonus ball not "respect" and playing by the rules. Don't see this movie and then expect to scream at a field. "4 is 1 !!"
