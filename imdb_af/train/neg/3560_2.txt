For me, this is a story that starts with some funny jokes about France fanatics when traveling with stairs and when sitting in business meetings. The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour, you'll see the same fantasies / funny situations time and time again. This is too predictable. This is done more than a TV story where you can get away and return without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I love Felix Herngren as Frank, but that's not enough, even if it's a comedy, it should be more. variations and a kind of message to his audience. <br /> <br />
