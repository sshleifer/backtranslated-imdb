For 50 years after World War 2, the United States was in a state where major segments of the economy are dominated by military interests. At the same time, everyone in the community served for the sake of the concept and wars, or was connected to someone who had it. <br /> <br /> It allowed a minigenre to be based on the idea of ​​American smartness in the midst of a rigid military machine. Sometimes that machine was non-US military, for example in prison of war situations. Once removed, stories are in other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always refer to this military genre. Indeed, the testosterone shots of action even refer to their comic brother or sister. <br /> <br /> You can track it, I think, maybe starting in the cartoon, which means Amrican, divisions of The Great Escape, which immediately outgrew tee-offspring in Gomer Pyle and Hogan's Heros. Then there is a second wave by "Catch 22" and "MASH", which were both real life, then books, then movies and in the MASH case, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But above all, there was the "Phil Silvers Show" about a Sergeant Bilko and that was due to "Mister Roberts." A happy man, who has committed only harmless crimes, and then only in response to an excessive crude system that tries to limit his life. It was in the day TeeVee showed. You absorbed them instead of just letting them work to talk about. It wasn't particularly smart in any way, except to find that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> The one big zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgiving, even engaging lies in a military context, a zone appropriated by one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> Because it's big, it sometimes pays in laughter. "Stripes" were pretty funny, I thought. It had the turn of the misfits to actually defeat serious enemies, such as folding into a dirty box. And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now, before the cultural wars, escalate. It's trying to touch that nice place, like other remake that Steve Martin treated. It's so unique, you're actually rooting for the army to be the stronger player. Another way to find out how societies work out the handles on military force. <br /> <br /> Ted's evaluation - 1 of 3: You can find something better with this part of your life.
