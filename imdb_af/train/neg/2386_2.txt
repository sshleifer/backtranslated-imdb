I missed this movie in the cinema, but have an idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, and when I saw it on the shelves in DVD, I thought "time to watch it". Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can't save this turkey, certainly one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot was poorly rendered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I read Robbins's novel, but if the film is not quite different from the novel, and with Robbins helping me in the script, I doubt it, and the novel must also be indifferent. be read. br /> <br /> I hope the actors are well paid, as they have been embarrassed by such celluloid waste and more recently DVD space, for example Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to sometimes seem uncomfortable. Save yourself about 98 minutes of your life for something worth more like pruning your teens or sorting out your boot loader. Even when you see it in the "under $ 5" disposal box at your local store, resist the urge!
