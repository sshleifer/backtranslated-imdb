OK, I will admit it started out very well and well, but then it just went downhill. I can't believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could read the script even after about 5 minutes. The only reason I actually saw the whole movie, I wanted to see the bend, and to my surprise, well, people, I can't even tell you if there was one, because the end just let you down, and then the credit, I was like hell? It did not deserve a theatrical walk, but it didn't seem to me that terrible. The only reason I gave it was 4 because it had some jumping parts. That's it! you can see it, i don't tell you how much you like it or even love it! but if you hate it, don't say I didn't warn you!
