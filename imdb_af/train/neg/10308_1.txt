It's really very bad. Lamas just shows how a two-day actor does his job. But what is worth looking at is the scene where OJ grabs a fellow police through the throat as if they are killing them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyrics "I have the evidence on you!". (Let me hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I couldn't find it on iTunes). Talk about view in the future ... Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. The score and songs are more interesting than the writing. This is the successor. What the question why they would do a successor. My understanding was that foreign sales are driving many of these B movies. Don't say much to the world's habits.
