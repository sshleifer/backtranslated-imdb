I saw this movie with the intention of not keeping it. I'm not sure. This is one of those movies made exclusively for the Oscars: music throughout the film in almost every frame, almost no profanity, in a long time past, sepia-toned image, pretentious title, NO sex, and a genius that everything explains what he thinks and ends in sfx / cgi so we (the stupid audience) can get it. One thing that amused me is the fact that they spelled the NOBLE PRICE wrong! Instead, they call the Nobel Prize (named after a real person called Alfred Nobel) 'the noble prize'. Jesus! How can one make such a mistake in such a great production, which is presumably based on a true story. What a shame! What were you and the other thinking about RON?
