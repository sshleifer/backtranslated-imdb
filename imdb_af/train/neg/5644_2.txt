What happened to the British TV drama? From John Major by Tony Blair, the focus of the genre has shifted from social realism to smugly normative women-focused stories about the piddling domestic problems of good middle-class professionals. <br /> <br /> (Or maybe TVNZ doesn't buy the good stuff? let it be what it is ...) <br /> <br /> The author's long career in sails probably explains why dialogue consists mainly of obsolete clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong on meaningful appearance, anyone who holds the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve. Baleful, however, seems to be a poor substitute for depth of character, as the author failed to provide such material for actors to work with. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's theoretically a thrill, about a murder investigation; but it is not as important as the central character's failed marriage and the associated problems. Is Cusack's character's man a complete bastard? Will her son be completely traumatized by breaking up the marriage? Making these central issues is not a sign of insight - it indicates a deep narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who must continue with her work. <br /> <br /> Lynda La Plante knows how to write these things so it feels like it matters and other viewers than household neurotics; It is clear that Paula Milne is not the job.
