*** SPOILERS *** Like an evil Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double-game combination, we returned in "Omen IV" the evil seed of the deceased AntiChrist Damien Thorn. Terror of his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and eventually the whole world as a name of Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being given to a deserving couple by the York Karen & Gene, Fay Grant and Michael Woods, by the Catholic Church's St Francis Orphanage. <br /> <br /> Little Delia didn't waste any time making her farmers feel. by scratching her mother at a home party. Later, Delia is almost killed by a runaway truck to save herself through this devil's dog, called Ryder. Go to school Delia takes care of the local bully by letting the big man water himself before all his classmates. Later, when his father threatened the Yorks with a suit, his head cut into a self-induced traffic accident! Delia is someone you never waste if you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dalia's father, Gene, becomes a big man in town on his own, or he thinks, by being elected to the congress as a champion of clean air and green trees crowd instead of smog and concrete races taking over the ward with its eye over the White House itself! Did his bitter and strange daughter Delia have nothing to do with Gen York's sudden happiness? <br /> <br /> It is only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is appointed as Delia's child educator, that the truth comes out about her strange and evil powers. Jo, a New Age type, realizes that Delia is a bit strange after she has turned all her white crystals black. She calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come over and watch her out. Noah is so upset about what he sees in Delia Kirilian color vibrations, all black and blue with a little pinch of red, that it's so bad he almost crashed into Delia's mammoth. <br /> <br /> Taken on a journey to a psychological festival by Jo Delia, the whole event changes into an inferno environment where spiritual telepathy is set alight. Everyone running there should also be used for the cover, including the poor Noah who was at the festival and broke his leg. The and shaken and battered Guru were so shocked by the whole experience he later controlled from the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. <br /> <br /> Jo's self was later thrown out, with the help of the lovely and cuddly family pet Ryder, from a second floor window to her death because she knew and spoke too much. This is when Karen is pregnant again that she finally decides to find out the truth about Delia's right parents. That's when she, and we in the audience, come face to face with the truth. She's not just the dreaded AntiChrist or Revelations, she's his twin sister! Her brother, the AntiChrist herself, is about to come to the scene as her child's brother, the soul unborn Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times more than enough to return the AntiChrist to Armageddon. The movie going public is already getting tired of him and his evil adventures. With a fourth really unnecessary, since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, had been dead and buried for years. Was through the ordinary call without anyone believing that the little Delia was "Tea" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her lethal rounds to destroy all mankind. The movie as bad as it has been too long, 97 minutes, for a horror movie that could well tell his story is as little as 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> With a private eye, Earl Knight, Mchael Learner, and later a former Catholic non-sister Yvonne, Megan Lehch, and now also faith healer Felichy in the movie to just die also did not help the plot. It just prolonged the suffering of our movie. You can see the surprise ending almost as soon as the movie "Omen IV" started with the bases being cleaned for Delia's eventual takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world. What was a bit of a surprise, Delia was having a little help from friends.
