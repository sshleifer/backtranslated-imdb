It was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen? I don't really know why? Just get your stories about the man who is about to get married and get hold of someone else. Story was told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time when these kind of actors / actresses come together to make a movie that's been made a million times before, it's really entertaining. There is usually little cunning thing in them that is not really in anyone else. For some reason, this one does not just keep your attention. You can pick a few funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason it's just not funny or clever in any way. I wish I new how to explain it, but I don't ?? Don't just waste your time on this one?
