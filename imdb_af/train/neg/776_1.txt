I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather picked up the video for free at the mall. I remember it's really sucked. The plot had no sense. I hated the fox Casper's friend had become. He was so stupid! Casper scared his head if he couldn't find a friend. Approximately? Come on! The only good part and I don't want to be a healthy spirit is when the fox is shot dead and dead. I laughed my head in the repayment because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news was the fox raised and became a ghost. I wish he had died. I think I even gave this video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offer it for free at the mall. If you have a child, don't let them see it. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
