I remember remembering this movie a long time ago on television. I remember the assumption that the movie is about a lot of hotel people being eaten by ants. What I didn't remember was how terrible it was !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it should have been a mistake, because movies like this usually disappear from existence and are never found again! Suzanne Somers (at the height of her career playing Chrissy at 'Three's Company') plays a holiday at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers install a pool outside and accidentally an ant's nesting sturgeon. Or should I say, a * MAN-EAT NEXT * !! One of the workers is actually attacked by the ants. One moment he unpacked them one by one his clothes, the next moment he was covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was far-fetched, you should see that Myrna Loy plays a wheelchair-bound resident who is pulled out of the Manor by the helicopter! I could almost make her imagination think she was out of the movie! <br /> <br /> The final scenes depicting Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third man on the floor of a hotel room blowing their backs to each other through reeds and covered in ants. <br /> <br /> It's basically the movie. There is really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star". It was meant to be a large-scale television event at the time. Now it is fortunate to be dumped in a 4:00 am on your local television station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at its best, look for an episode from Three's Company. If you want Myrna Loy to do everything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
