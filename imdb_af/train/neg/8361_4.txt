-SPOILES-Lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the extortion of a great collaboration executive Rosenlski the president of Unasco Inc. through on the lamb beach comber David Ziegler living the life of Reilly, or Ziegler, in his beach home in Cancun Mexico.Having this CD, which he gave to his brother James, involved three years of telephone conversations between Rosenlski and the president of the United States in criminal transactions. This CD gave David a head start over the international gangsters to him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James gets a little greedy by shelling off Rosenlski for 2 million in diamonds has not only cost him his life, but has put David at risk of losing him. Ropsenlski wants him to negotiate the CD with David to get his former wife, Liz, to talk to him about how he should give it. Rosnelski made an agreement to pay off her debt as she passed through. David is later murdered by Rosenliski's Mexican hit Tony, with the help of a big white shark, who just doesn't go for all these peaceful relationships with his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony took the CD that Liz left his boss at a local hotel safe and now wants James, like David, to kill and at the same time keep the CD to have something about Rosenlski . <br /> <br /> David, who secretly hid the diamonds that James had during his murder, is now the target of Tony and his men to lock him well. David also wants to take the diamonds and, at the same time, gives his boss, Rosenlski, the impression that the CD that David had, is lost, but later used, without Rosenlski knowing who is behind it. <br /> <br /> The movie "Night of the Sharks" has a number of shark attacks in it with this huge one-eyed white shark that eventually includes about half a dozen of the players, including Tony. David, a strong rifle believer, uses high explosives and Molotov cocktails, as well as his fists, to take out the entire Tony crew. Even the killer shark is done with Tony, but with a hunting knife, not a gun. When it comes to using firearms to save his friend and sidekick Paco, a friend Juanita and his priest, Father Mattia, are from Tony and his gang rifles are no no to David. He was more of a knife and spearman than anything else. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was about as predictable as you could. David thought he was killed by the one-eyed shark later out of the crowd after Rosenlski was convinced he was dead and left the town. David continues his life as a free, lively and loving beach marker, without anyone trying to kill him and wealthing about two million dollars. after David's credit he had his friend. Paco returns Rosenski his CD, but under the circumstances that if something happened to him, his cousin, who Rosenlski does not know who and where he is, will shoot his big mouth and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal actions.
