If you want to watch a true 'quality' movie, you get the Eden Formula. This amazing movie has to cost $ 50. It features a wafer thin script, pathetic bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop-motion, paper-mache sample that is completely fusible (it looks like they are sometimes a man in a rubber suit and / or a glove used for the monster - but everyone was equally terrible. <br /> <br /> The actors all speak their lines as if they have never seen it and read a teleprompter. The special effects are very boring. And the only sad thing is that they have dropped the really fine original title "Tyranasaurus Wrecks", which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you break the bottom of the barrel as hard as you can to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> I loved it every minute.
