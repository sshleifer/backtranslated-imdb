A bit of a disappointing movie, I want to say: the play was somehow bumped. In many cases, I just couldn't feel the facial expressions speak the words or the intention of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character must believe the viewer is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). It doesn't happen here. <br /> <br /> The commentary on the authors that you already know the characters was appropriate. They do things and say things coming out of nowhere: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other; then he blows up and rushes out and tells his father: Don't touch me, you f ***! Perhaps, if we saw the prequel, we would understand where everything came from, but there is no prequel, so we are slightly at sea for reason! <br /> <br /> One strange, strange thing Andrew does is to go to an old quarry, sit on the edge overlooking the "still water" below; then he comes in his nail bag and unpacks a cigarette and lifts one. He did the same thing three times during the film; I think we should see it as some tortured act to be alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It could even be four times, I lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he recently found out he was adopted; It happens very early in the movie, so there is no sense of any dramatic change he may undergo as a result of this discovery. It's not really clear if it's why it's so bitter or if it's about something else. <br /> <br /> I think there is a kind of Lynchian feel to the movie, but should really try to scale a director for the first time. a mountain so early in his career?
