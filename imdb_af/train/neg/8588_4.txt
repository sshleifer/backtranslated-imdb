The revenge of the Sith begins with a long action series that is impressive without being terribly exciting, and then becomes very boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same terrible dialogue and dull legs that rest the rest of the prequel. series have plagued. The only thing that facilitates the proceedings is the slow - and I mean slow - building that we know is the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, it's pretty good. Not good. Not even good. But pretty good. This movie is highly praised because it doesn't suck to the high heaven like the previous successors. Instead, it's just turgid, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are sometimes impressive. Bu the lightsabre battles? They are all a boring mess. I think the dark side got hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. It will make a lot of money, but thank you that it's over. This once-worshiped franchise is beaten enough. I saw the 12: 1 show, and then I heard a group of very young children say it was fantastic! But everyone over the age of eight mumbled the same thing: I slept in the middle. It was a bit boring. I just thought that Darth Vader's birth would be better. So we all said.
