At least I was able to mock the film, which is surprising since I could barely put it through. In all honesty, guessing, the cover for the DVD case is more than the whole movie. And saying it's the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version of that net came out ... nice guys, it was misleading enough to catch me. The only thing that frustrated me than the irreconcilable play of the copycat was his hairstyle. Usually you only see those hairs on a ten-year-old boy and the character did so. The film looks like a D + graduate of a film school excited to use every movie he has ever learned while attending classes. Sometimes less friends are more. Through out I would be lost by random plots that were nowhere to go or unexplained. All of this makes a bad movie, but if the end doesn't even come close to pulling it together, it makes it a particularly bad movie. This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen, and it includes the French final video of my senior year high school friends, but hey, maybe I'm a bit biased, I mean I had an extra play. P.S. I don't even think it deserves a star, not even a half. NO FOR YOU !!
