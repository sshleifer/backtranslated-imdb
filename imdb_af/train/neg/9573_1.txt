Not quite from the wall, but just totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an awkward mix of sci-fi, horror and suspected comedy. What it is like is a sensible and totally incoherent film. There is a very small dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the font, if any, is a complete "dam scum". I won't even call it strange, more like just "total nonsense". This movie is sure to disappoint, and you've been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the sharp smell will fall asleep like rotten fish ..................... ..... ..................................... NOTE
