This is a typical late Universal Horror movie: it is technically competitive, if at the numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overworking. The most interesting part of this movie is the stunt throw of Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the film's "monster". It is sad to exploit this man, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less gruesome than the studio hoped for, because I felt more sorry about fear or even dislike. Martin Koslack is on board as the movie's crazy artist, and he is very amusing in this part. I enjoy Koslack almost seeing everything; For some reason almost the man me. The only other part of the movie that has entertained me is the film's absurdity in the art world. Here, bad art critics are shown who make a huge difference in their ability to break artists. It's next to each other with the movie's male "hero" who is an "artist" who paints ... gets this ... girl in the lead. Somehow our hero's work is being reviewed on the side of the villa's absurd sculpture. Also amusing is the film's main novel critic, who at one stage claims to despise the hero's pin art because "women don't exist" and our heroine replies with the assurance that the critic just doesn't get enough. Finally, there is a subplot about the heroine (who is an art critic himself), housing by the front man .... totally anti-feminist and ridiculous to testify. Overall, this movie is a pretty mediocre picture with some entertaining elements.
