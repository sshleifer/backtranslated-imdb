There is not a single sympathetic character in this whole movie. Is this the lawyer who is being played by Kenneth Branagh? Well, let's see - we're learning he's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets technical criminals. He treats his colleagues like cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process of killing one of them), endangers the safety of his children, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, trying to strengthen the police and school administrators - and all this for what? Because he thought with his little head! I was really drawn to the father and his gang to knock the clothes out of the attorney and drown him in the swamp ... it would have made a much more satisfying end.
