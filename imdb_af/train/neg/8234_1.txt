The authors and producers of this little outing plunged new deptes of depravity. Did the writer's block so badly OR have dried up so many ideas that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman breaks down in the back seat of a bus and then throws the feces behind the car. summary at least what this movie is worthy of). We had already been treated to one of the other women who had been battling one of her friends, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have been sufficient ... we have the message! It really takes toilethuman to another level! If the screenplay and acting were better, I could easily have forgotten that I watched a movie shot entirely on a low-budget video. It was a fairly original storyline, with a clever (only) piece of direction, as we just had to take the inside view of the bus; through which it feels much more real. We never looked elsewhere, such as the shop or the field where several of the women disappeared, and that could have contributed to the stress. <br /> <br /> The writing was bad. Lines like: "I don't feel too good ... I want to go home" after one of the girls is pursued by a psychopath; subject to rape by a screwdriver and shot, looks a little undercooked. <br /> <br /> The acting was diabolical (apart from the maniac). Have learned all the main 5 actresses by following a correspondence course during a long post strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with the captions. <br /> <br /> The director managed to have an easy job. The only direction he had to give seemed to be: "Shout girls". <br /> <br /> AND AS FOR WRITING ...... If you see it, be sure you have some paracetamol ready. !
