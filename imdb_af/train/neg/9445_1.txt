Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was terrified. <br /> <br /> Don't take children to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they will be bored and disappointed. Certainly * we all * read Theo's wonderful children's book and we certainly have expectations ... but it is pure waste. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and would definitely never use his "thumb" in such a deadly attempt to capitalize on a classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth a "free" ticket inspection. <br /> <br /> Paste the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual depiction - save your money ... seriously. SAVE your money - it will be on the cable through holy patty's day. <br /> <br /> Shame shame about what they do !!
