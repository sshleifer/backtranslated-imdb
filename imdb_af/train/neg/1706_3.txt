Wow, it was a very bad movie. As in other comments, this movie has no plot, no character development. They may have had some kind of script, but it's hard to tell based on the real end result. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie wasn't really there, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to help the viewer determine what actually happens. <br /> <br /> All in all, a low-budget zombie flick that has not been devised simply has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this 1 or 2 movie is the gore factor, I think it should be where they spent money trying to justify it. <br /> <br /> Unless you're (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie movies, you can't look at this. Period.
