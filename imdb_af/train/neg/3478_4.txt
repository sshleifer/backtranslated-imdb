Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not only to be this Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also offensive and guilty of many grandiose. Drew goes back to the house he grew up in and offers the family living there, the Valco's, $ 250,000 to be his "family" through the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is hesitant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say in the case, but learns to keep Drew ... not exactly the same sentiment with daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but it also has room for change. Drew's girlfriend, Missy (Jennifer Morrison), pulled drops off. Drew and wants her people to meet his family. Real fun is in the store as a happy Noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comedies, though strange.
