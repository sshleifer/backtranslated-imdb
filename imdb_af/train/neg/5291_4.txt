STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, had problems with alcohol and form now a drug habit that makes him paranoid and tends to domestic violence to his wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together but eventually comes more like a doormat. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that drives him off the rails. The movie follows these indifferent characters, as they keep pace with their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British seem to be miserable, and it will include movies so entertaining. Movies like Nil at Mouth highlight it. It's a story of a broken family, torn by crime, poverty, liquor and drugs, the kind of Jeremy Kyle will be like a three-course meal. It is also essentially a story of self-destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, shaving a family apart and women trying to keep it together, despite not being strong enough. If you pick up a bit about what goes from the outlet, you can see that it's not a promise to look from the beginning. It's certainly not disappointing. <br /> <br /> That's what everyone said about the performances, and the main stars, Winstone and Burke, perform very well. We see Winstone losing it with his wife and hitting her senselessly after a few more booze-induced paranoia, breaking down a phone call with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to show him . Likewise, in a private moment, we see Burke on a staircase able to lose her calmness, the full impact of the night before it kicks in. <br /> <br /> It is still one of those movies where there is no plot, as such, just a real sense of the life of these hopeless lives from one day to the next. It is argued by many (including the Baftas!), But it was just too grim and dark for me. I have no right to criticize it because I knew what I knew about the offset, but unfortunately it was how I found it. **
