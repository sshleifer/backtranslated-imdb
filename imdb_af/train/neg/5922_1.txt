My mom holds a cassette of this movie as a common threat to any film-loving person who annoys her. Everything stinks about it. <br /> <br /> As such, it is a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? Have you accidentally watched a good movie and accidentally voted for this one? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the movie process must be forced to watch at least a small portion of this movie. It must be an indelible spot on the mind of all the film that is sacred and honored as the tide of the film.
