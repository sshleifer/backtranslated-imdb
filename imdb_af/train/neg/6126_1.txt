For the case, one of the worst movies ever made. Plot goes as follows. Walk through the jungle, watch areas for 10 minutes or so. Have Bo go somewhere and strip. Skip the jungle even more. Give Bo another excuse to strip. Back to the jungle. Oh look! There is a Tarzan looking old! Strip, upper strip. Kill the safari people. Tarzan looking for man has a battle scene. Save Bo. Top strips. Run credits. Begin credits, run.
