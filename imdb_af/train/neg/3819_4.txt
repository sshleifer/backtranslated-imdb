T.Z. Post, college professor, received a false letter in which he inherited $ 750,000. Now with financial means, he withdraws his $ 4,000 life-saving, and finally decides to go out and live. Having sent his luggage on a train to Chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville troop, and decides well enough to give him a show on Broadway. The night of the show, poor prof. Post has to hide from his creditors, establish the relationship between friend Pansy & & Floozy diva Eleanor, and make sure the performance continues. Having looked at many of Keaton's silent jewels, this is one pain to go through, but I felt it could have been much worse. Supporting cast Durante, Todd, & Selwyn sometimes get extremely irritating, but still adaptable. A Pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as the frustrated show director. 90% of the script is badly written, as MGM is trying to write it as an armman's Marx Bros film, after which many of the eyes are flat. Along with Keaton's drinking problems at the moment, this movie is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating-3.
