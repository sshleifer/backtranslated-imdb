I saw the movie trailer several times at the theater and I got excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like the one made in 1990. It also reminds me of Fugitive movies, a cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. The Sentinel, however, is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say it's like a TV movie. Not quite. First, there are far more better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies can sometimes be fun, but this movie is exactly the opposite of a good time. It's not stylish at all and most importantly, the tone of the movie is unattractive. It's not an action movie, there are two action scenes that consist of a chase and a collision. They are also not great action scenes, but the worst is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the murder of the president is also the most clich√© story in this genre, but they insist. And it's not a cat and mouse movie as it is supposed to be. Although Douglas is now very old, he still has the potential to act in an action thriller. For example, in the movie Michael Douglas can't be like Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is also a wrong choice because you feel like you are watching Jack Bauer and somehow, his character is one of the reasons that make the movie like a TV movie. Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or straight in this movie, as she is a soap opera actress. The movie wasn't fun for me for a moment, so I couldn't overload for a while.
