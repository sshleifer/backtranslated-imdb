MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just got up late and watched this movie, mainly because I enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's previous work such as "Boyz n the hood". However, I have to say it was a great disappointment and is all I hate about infected, clich√©, so-called "message" movies. <br /> <br /> The play is mainly poor (pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors ... take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes lesbian overnight?) please! ), but worst of all, strengthen every stereotype you can see. By the second half of the film it became a cartoon as it characterizes it, losing any empathy you had for its one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not once is there a valid point about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, the results of these problems are merely sensitized. The message is inconsistent, leading to a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot compilation. Regarding the conclusion of the films, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and moderately offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning" I have to say that all I learned is never to see it again. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a real comment on some of the themes that this movie doesn't really work out then rent "American History X" .... unless you just watch and go to Tyra Banks rent a life.
