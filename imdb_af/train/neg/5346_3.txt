I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the movie lived up to expectations. In fact, it sometimes makes it uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer films, the sexual antics are kept to a minimum. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily unnecessary and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the plays and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The movie is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery and failing at all points. It is as if Meyer is trying to make up for sex exploitation / blackmail by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a little guilty of touching the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene in which Lady Susan wears a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tries to return to the fair path by changing it into a movie about the triumph of good about evil. However, because they cancel each other, you end nothing. <br /> <br /> Being so bad in so many ways, it's really worth checking out if you appreciate the art of making a terrible movie in the worst possible way. Perhaps, because it's so bad, we've almost done away with Meyer with the unacceptable.
