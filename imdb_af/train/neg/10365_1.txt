Awful. This thriller had to bury it. What a piece of crap. Terrible writing, characters are less than credible. Horrible Schlock !! Keep a few B stars in a terribly written POS to give it a little credit, but it fails. If I didn't write ten lines on this movie, I'd give it a word review, start with 'sh' and end with 'it'. <br /> <br /> Terrible end, delayed. Who writes this crap. The end of this movie was so confronted, weak, as if they had no idea what to do with this story line, or they just walked out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie. It is a good thing that these actors are on their way, as it will be a career killer. Good thing for those who hardly see anyone. At least no one important, like future investors. It could have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel sadness from my precious time. <br /> <br /> Don't struggle with this one, you'll feel you are wasting time, you can never get it. back.
