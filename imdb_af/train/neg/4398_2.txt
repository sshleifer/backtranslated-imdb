Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have always appreciated, and that was the only reason I watched this movie. Well, all I can say is sorry for me! These two great actors have been humiliating themselves by doing a lot of irrelevant, imaginative and kitch (not bad) sketches that are supposed to make people laugh but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by focusing on it. I can't think of anything else, because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since. I would recommend avoiding this movie unless you want your opinion of the two actors spoiled.
