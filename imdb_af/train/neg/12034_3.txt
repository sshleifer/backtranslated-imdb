The story of the movie was so simple mental as its morality: Look for a girl, marry her, happy with her happy. Although the film had fine moments and turns, most of them remained on the surface that could be shown in a movie with the same storyline. <br /> <br /> The Baptist / Mormon struggle was just superficially touched and mocked, probably deliberately. An interesting story would have been a mixed couple. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that doesn't need too much concentration, that can be watched by the whole family and that teaches your children modestly and conservatively (except the modern tolerance ;-)) you'll be fine with this movie. Can be shown at a family home evening ...
