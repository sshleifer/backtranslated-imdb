Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-year-old woman whose late start with a serious relationship leads her to a significantly younger man and a subsequeness breakout with 2 longest best friends. <br /> <br /> See a gigolo / gold digger in the sincere young man, the "girl friends" who died on ending this "stupid relationship", goes beyond the call to help their friend (what obviously blinded by these gigos is difficult game ". <br /> <br /> A short sequence of situations is absolutely ridiculous. Stories are no longer covered. Without these incredible scenes there may be hope for a lovely love story. instead of all the viewer In addition, an involuntary shaking of the head - these things just do not happen! Without giving the stone hanger details, I warn the viewer to have high expectations for this movie, most (like me) will very disappointed, scale from 1 to 10, this one is a bad one for me 4. There is much better material out there is not worth your time.
