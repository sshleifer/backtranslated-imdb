My God, what's going on? Your Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> Nice to note that most of the positive reviews come from newbies to Boll's work. As I said in previous Uve Boll reviews, I just watched my films in the hope that someday he would actually make something good. I mean .. it must happen one day! <br /> <br /> Oh, Seed isn't that day. I don't quite know where to start with the lame attempt on a horror movie that Seed is. The thing to remember people is that all the sick in the world are so due to the fact that they have watched various diseases on video or just ..... or so believe Mr. Boll. I still can't figure out why life footage and murder footage was needed in the first 10 minutes of this movie. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a sicko and enjoys such things ..... but do not understand why Mr. Boll thought to make REAL footage in the movie work. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm ..... Well, I'm not sick and can't see anything on film. However, I do not find the use of real animal cruelty footage in the slightest entertainment. If you tried to shock me, it didn't work. It just reminded me how devastated the world was because such things happen and also because your Boll is allowed to continue making movies. This kind of context may have worked for movies in the 70/80's (Cannibal Holocaust), but not today's market. <br /> <br /> By the way, we can continue with the fact that You've been giving the movie a very cheap feeling like BloodRayne 2. You can only say that there was not a large amount of money for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll doesn't really care. for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots by police officers who watch several videos of Seed's victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends in an accelerated dissolution of the victim. It's all very boring and boring. I won't comment on the toddler scene because it's laughter and just another cheap 'shock' factor. <br /> <br /> If you can sit for the first 25 minutes, you will be treated with the police officers. a very dark house to catch Seed. The lighting here is terrible and yours has the old 'I don't use a fixed camera' fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. See how police officers die in increasingly stupid men until as long as Seed is caught. This scene is so stupid you have to see it to believe it. The police actually say to Saad that he could have shot him. For some unknown reasons, the police did not shoot him. Since Seed is a sicko that kills both children and adults, at this point you would have thought in the scripture that would dominate that sentence. <br /> <br /> From here we are treated to a stupid executive scene, followed by police buried Seed alive (and they know he's alive ... why not shoot him in the head?), followed by Seed coming out of the ground and then killing a random woman with a hammer and then abducting the one from the police's family. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to come to you is that it's just plain STUPID! It's not even Hollywood horror stupid. Just plain stupid. Your Boll can't direct. Anyone with any of our tastes will agree with that statement. Anyone who is viewing this movie and entertaining or shaping it in a way, should take a serious view of themselves as a person. <br /> <br /> Again we are treated to a poorly performed, directed, illuminated, manufactured, written piece of UB crap.
