After I didn't read the novel, I can't tell how faithful this movie is. The story is typical riddle material: killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that is exactly how it plays. The first two-thirds are boring, except for the murders and the last one-third makes a partial return, as it picks up speed in the direction of its winding conclusion. <br /> <br /> The action is strictly subpar, although it is difficult to blame the actors alone: ​​the script is horrible. During the last 1/3 you stop watching because the movie is actually interesting, but it's just the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there is just as much he can do with a TV budget and network sensors on his back. He is pretty much limited to quick cuts and distorted lenses, though he manages to squeeze into the club toilet in a few "under-floor" shots. Unfortunately, as it is made for TV, the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found. Note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you attach him. <br /> <br /> Summary: This movie is poor according to cinema standards and mediocre by TV standards (see CSI, instead). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some great suggestions: get a copy of Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (my highest recommendation, excellent movie), "Opera" or even "Tenebre" . They are stronger in each category.
