This "movie" is more like a music video. In 2004, Kusturica said in an interview that if he made movies, he felt like making music, and when he made music, he felt like making movies. Kusturica said in the same interview that the dialogue in the movies was like noise. "Promise me, it" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I like "Life is a miracle". It was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and on some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "Promise me, it" has no plot. I was waiting for this movie with great expectations because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite writers, who also participated in "Life is a wonder". Ranko Bozic writes good dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise". And to my regret I was just two dialogues, which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the screenplay was used by the director to make his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scriptures for "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. "Black cat white cat" was the only writing Kusturica said he would not touch. According to Gordan Mihic, Kusturica comes back to the script, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. And I think that's the case with "Promise Me It". He had to follow Ranko Bozic's script. <br /> <br /> "Promise me, this is a" comedy ", but there are very few moments that made me laugh. I don't think the difference comes from the fact that the black cat was written by white cat by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> But I know some people who liked it: "Promise me", they find it very positive.
