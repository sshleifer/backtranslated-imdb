Very disappointing movie. By the end, I no longer have any characters for Georg. I enjoyed watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was good as always, still not worth watching. It starts getting strong and just gets weaker and weaker. Insomniacs will love it because I'm sure it'll let them sleep.
