Steven Seagal .... how can you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies were usually pretty clean. I lost a lot of respect because you're in a horrible movie like this one. Very, very bad taste! I'm ashamed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you're still in movies like this one, I believe your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies, because you can always make the bad guy "with some hand maneuvers and clean it ... and also the language is beautiful in your movies ... but This one is something else, I will think twice before renting another movie of yours.
