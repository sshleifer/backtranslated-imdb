This movie has a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. She has beautiful green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend. It's not a good horror movie, or a good fake journalism report, or well done remotely. There is no skill in his production. It's like a bad student movie. The story's horrible elements don't make you sick, it's the fact that it's so weak that makes you sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.
