"Creepshow 2" is a little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with little purpose, other than subscribing to the name of the previous movie. It even strengthens the mistakes of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy-handed. Yet, for the first time, there was enough excitement to solve it. This led to an uneven but overall rather entertaining effort. The successor has little valuable moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more evident. Once, it survives, but most of the time it just goes there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts. A Wood Indian comes to life, revenge on the murderers of his owner. Teenagers are consumed by a water sample. A Hitchhiker returns from death to pursue a careless motorist. Neither of these sites is inherently bad in themselves, but they have no inspiration. There are few surprises and no fear. This is a textbook example of unmotivated, through-the-number movie processing. It doesn't help that this cheapest movie suffers from a flat live style, but to be honest, there wasn't much to work with. In the end, the second story comes from the best, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, performances are at best good. George Kennedy, as the bad general store owner, does an adequate, if not particularly, inspired job. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is pretty good as the guilty motorist, giving sympathy to her fate, despite the predictable excess material. However, most characters are very thin. <br /> <br /> One would think "Creepshow 2" would have been better. Originally directed, George Romero returned the script based on more of Stephen King's stories. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns into some good, gory work. So why is the movie a countdown? I think Romero didn't really want to make a second movie, but had to force it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror prosecutions, clones, rip-offs, and what didn't, so this one was definitely inevitable. I can imagine the man getting the script hurry, picking up his salary and running down. I think he had to do what was needed to fund his own projects; we can't blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br /> Released by New World Pictures
