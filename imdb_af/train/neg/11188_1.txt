It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this steamy dream of a movie. Incredibly dim, poorly acted, terrifying writing, often incoherent and too many scenes that do not remain relevant to the overall film (such as when Heath Ledger's priestly spouse is nailed a ghost to a wall ... what was the point in that scene ? Please reply to a postcard ... ... <br /> <br /> I had to get a medal to stick to this movie because it's the entire running time. I'd rather give a strong kick to the groin than to go through this movie again. <br /> <br /> It should be put in the bottom 100 of the IMDb. Hopefully my 1/10 vote will help it in its own way.
