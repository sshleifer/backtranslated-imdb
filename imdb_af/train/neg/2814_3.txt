1st watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary, but sadistic (meaningful) representation of a relative of the Marquis De Sade who performs and enjoys the same sadistic acts as his predecessor. This Tobe Hooper movie doesn't look much different from its similar style. Freddy Krueger movies with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) play a dual role (the Marquis De Sade and his family member). It also seems as if it really wants to try Christianity, but in the end it loses much to my chagrin, but I leave a conflicting feeling for the movie. Could have been much worse than violations in sex and violence, but they are trying to keep it at a minimum despite a few disgusting scenes. My last thought is why Hooper wants to make this movie. Of course, it took a while to actually be distributed, then it must be horribly advertised and with Hooper's name in the title hopefully to make money on his name and his gore. Obviously it doesn't work.
