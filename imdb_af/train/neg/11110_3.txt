I just want to be known that I don't often watch movies under a 5. I was initially very excited to see this movie. His many TV trailers for a few months made me really want to watch this movie. So, the other night I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The storyline was intriguing enough - a few men hit unsuspecting people on the subway. There is a photographer who is obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What happens to them? One day the photographer sees a connection between a few photos he has taken, and is obsessed with the butcher, followed by him, yada yada. The movie had a way of sucking you in, though the plot was highly predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you." I say, very bored about the cheap tension. <br /> <br /> The plot, though predictable, was intriguing ... it's up to the end. "It was good to the end. Then it just got stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I totally agree. And here's the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> See, I hoped it was an evil killer, a psychotic person who had obsession with cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that has been alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You had wonderful movies, but this one sank.
