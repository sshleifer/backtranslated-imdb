There is no doubt who is in charge of cadet training in this movie: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who fulfills the military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadet - the bomber. But he is not so strict that he is unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion on the value of women working in the army. He is tough when he needs to be, but at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he has perfected in other films. His character is the basis of the action that is all about. O'Brien obviously looks and plays well. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects that end.
