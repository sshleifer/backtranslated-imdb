To be honest, I heard it was pretty bad before I decided to watch it, but I'm never one that allows others to influence my views, but I'm probably more likely to look something out. Bullwhip went one way before the look anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in it immediately interested me. The picture is not very good, and is actually very morally doubtful, all the characters are corrupt and oblique in some form or form, all of which are motivated by greed or egocentric victories. It's all good and good as the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a naughty climax-like picture. Unfortunately, this is not and if the final fills your eyes with sugar, you can't help shouting that you have been watching a nice bad movie. No one in the throw comes out with credit, with chief Guy Madison hurting wood in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Not even the beautiful Rhonda can recommend me to anyone, 3/10
