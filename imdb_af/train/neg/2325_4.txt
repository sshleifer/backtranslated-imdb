the first scanners might not be a good movie, but it was at least original. There is no such novelty for this one. The drama is worse, in my opinion and the story is slower and nothing special. I also do not like the dialogue. And the special effects are no better than the original ones. This film is inferior to the first one in all ways. The only thing that is different is that it is sometimes hard and chaotic. But that doesn't mean 'I'm making a good movie. If they did something better with the story and made it interesting, it could be a decent movie. I couldn't do it without going through fast. For me, this is a forgotten movie, and not much more. Despite that, there are worse movies.be in a generous mood, I give Scanners 2 a 4/10.
