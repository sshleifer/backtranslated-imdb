I'm a big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma, but I couldn't believe he made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come close to the real Sholay. It doesn't leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between characters. There is no companionship between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are scarce screens with more than two people in the frame. The drive outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan didn't have to do this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen tried their best, but didn't use it. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather senseless. Mohanlal was right and proved it was all about facial expression and body language. The rest of the role was expected. The comedy situation adapted to the original shoay falls flat in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the screenplay, but because of the controversy surrounding the movie, he messed up and just for the sake of making him this Aag. But there is no fire.
