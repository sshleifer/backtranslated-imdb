DEATHSTALKER is ideal for B-fantasy movie fans; This scarce 80-minute travesty of movies makes everything hecklers can ask - non-existent plot, horrible acting (except at least a gritty sounding old lady), laughable mini-dissertation and shock editing, and cellar-style background. institutions. There are no characters that are so nice or interesting (in particular, the chapter has nothing appealing about him), and the actors who came together barely do anything above the F grade material. If that's not enough, how about the lack of a compelling plot (which this movie has nothing of the sort) to qualify DEATHSTALKER as an important turkey? I was also offended that the women in this movie hardly had any purpose other than being 1, topless and / or scantily clad; 2) raped; 3) having sex with the hero; 4) All of the above. In addition, the background music is terrible; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy fever bursts, and leaf orchestra. Over-arching and eye-cushioning all in one with nary that is one thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited to people who are looking for something to laugh and (and believe me, there are many). Otherwise, I do not recommend these 100-degree CONAN to recommend at all.
