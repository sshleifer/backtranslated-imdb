Another piece for junk! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word movie in the loose possible form!) I thought Telly Savalas's career was hit when he voted on the Birmingham video visit shown on Tarrant on TV on a semi regular basis, but then I forgot that he was involved! I tried to push it into my subconscious mind, but cable TV kicked the memory and yelled at me !! <br /> <br /> I like the bit (sarcastic laughing) in the movie claiming it's a play from Liverpool in the forties, but it's blatantly a shot of the Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. Also, in the steam train that the commandos rehearse, the JZ (Yugoslavian Zeleznice or Yugoslav Slavic State Railroad) logo is straight on the side of the locomotive, although the makers are trying to eradicate them. Why not just film in the UK, if that's where most of the movie is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap rubbish, and a waste of celluloid!
