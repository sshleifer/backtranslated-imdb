I loved this movie, I will admit it. It should be the best (straight to?) Video movie I've seen. Well ... my friend and I just decided for shits. I giggle that we will rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we had exactly what we expected, plus more. When the red neck at the Sasquatch slammed against the tree, we watched that part about three to four times, it was incredible (hysterical of course). And why? Oh why should the main character play so much? As honestly, we know you're in danger, and so much won't help. But really, if this movie is in your local video store, rent it. It's worth the money and it's not even that bad, as it is bad, but not incredibly bad. Overall, you will find yourself in the store when you rent this movie.
