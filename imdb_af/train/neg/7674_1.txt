True, there are many movies much worse than this movie. This movie was not Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I saw them both twice.) At the same time, this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed it). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Viewing razzie awards, your biggest competition has just arrived in the theaters. This movie I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. However, I will try to take you a step by step process of why this movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'll start with what might be the best component of this movie (alongside Christian Slater to be proud of himself. He has proven that it is possible to work fairly in a movie All his terrible dialogue he had to talk made me wonder why he just didn't go halfway through the set, maybe it was because Stephen Dorff was also in the movie (someone he wished he was Tara Reid is a bad actress but beautiful and it is all that really matters in movies like this, not to say that the acting was perfect, it was average, not good, and maybe the only thing in the movie is not good. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack - Except for "Wish I had an angel", the soundtrack is useless and bad heavy medal is pumped into the viewers ears , maybe thats the dreadful story (something I will soon get.) A long and very expensive 2 CD Soundtrack is now for sale to those who are musically challenged. <br /> <br /> Directed - Led by Hollywood's favorite director, Uwe Ball, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. We say, "Yes, movies can get really bad and it's just the beginning of my deadly saga of terrible movies." At least it is said to be directed by Your Ball. Without telling, I would guess that a monkey from the Congo was kidnapped, brought here and forced to make opinions about how to shock the movie to be shocked. The director of photography was probably a video camera tied to a skateboard and pushed forward until it hit a wall. On the screens where the camera must remain silent, it moves continuously so that we cannot stop anywhere and when it is in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> The Production- Who on Earth Is it silly enough to put money for this bomb? I'm sorry for the fool ... sometimes. Sometimes I am glad that he or she has been taught such a lesson to never make money for garbage, worse than the dog tied in a bag. <br /> <br /> The Writing / Storyboard trying to analyze the story is more painful than holding an ice-pick under a big toe and kicking such a soccer ball as hard as I can right away , but I'll still try it. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 kids are going to experiment under science. He escaped and stuck into an electrical connection where he electrolysed (this is the point where it got so bad, I started laughing out loud). Then it is many years later where he is a paranoia detective. He is attacked by a zombie that cannot be shot dead, kills it and continues with life. Later he was attacked by a mad monster and he discovered secrets that no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really very bad. The movie scene with the expectation that we read about 10 minutes, which read 100 of random text about a false civil injury called the Abskani. The film doesn't turn to the other, more than the audience can handle, more than the audience wants to handle, more than the audience can ever care for. This storyline is rocky but even Double Dragon is better. <br /> <br /> Overall, miss this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10, but that's because there is no 0.
