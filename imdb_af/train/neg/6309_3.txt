This movie has good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this movie unfortunately failed to create a dull, boring movie strip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford's 8th grade Social Studies class - back in 67. <br /> <br /> What a waste, someone will take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time a scene has potential, all we have left is a couple of clicks combined with black and white footage that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shame. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this dull feast. The other play was incredibly boring. It fits the movie well and everyone who played the Captain sets a new low standard for line delivery. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all these errors. movie and not worried about being surprised or entertained, but want to learn about the USS Mason, it's worth a watch.
