This stupid comedy really does a good job of wasting the comic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are badly abused here. I once visited this film once or twice, but in general it is a boring movie, with a bit of stupidity being thrown in well. The point of departure, though routine, was still not bad, but as soon as the plot was established, the film went nowhere. Don't waste your time with this burnout.
