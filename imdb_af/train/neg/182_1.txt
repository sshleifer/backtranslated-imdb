It is the worst sequel to the face of the world of movies. Again, it doesn't make it again. The killer is still killing for pleasure. But this time he is killing people who make a movie about what happened in the first movie. That means it's ever the stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. If you appreciate the one valuable hour during this movie, don't see it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to you who made him. Because it does not combine the original horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Don't let your kids watch it. Teen, young child or young adult, this movie has such an impact on people.
