This movie sounds like it can be entertaining and interesting from its description. But for me it was a bit of a deviation. Very slow and difficult to follow and see what's going on. It was as if the filmmaker had taken individual pieces of film and threw them into the air and cleaved them, no matter how they landed (certainly not in sequential order). Also, nothing of any consequence was filmed. I watched quite a few different Korean movies and noticed that a good portion was made good and a little reminiscent of the viewer's part, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one brought me to an end. I watched the movie a second and third time and it did nothing to me. I don't really understand what the filmmaker is trying to convey. If it were just a typical everyday part of a person's life, I think he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
