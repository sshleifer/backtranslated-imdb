I was delighted to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy in the services, director Stanley Donen, who doesn't like it yet? This is the kind of movie that makes me wonder about two things. When everyone was involved (including well-known names), they realized they had a turkey on their hands and what is the worst thing about it in a number of aspects? Still the first consideration, but my vote for the latter goes to the winding storyline, before the word-like, sometimes pretentious writing, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of reporting between characters. You have to add a lot of inequality to the criticism, but it is understandable that the actors are struggling with these things and being practiced next to them. Very often, they can hardly get their lines fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and sincere persona, but sometimes it seems uncomfortable and staccato in his delivery. However, I must say that I was relieved when the original suggestions left his character with the unspeakable vulgar Jayne Mansfield with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What about the movie? - For me, especially the beauty of Parker who also acts with self-control and a Grace Kelly dignity. Overall, the movie is nice to watch. The marine characters are very clever in their uniforms - but you really have to wonder about the horrible black Fu Manchu tunics they don't use in their luxury hotel package. Even Grant can't look elegant in his looks. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston is doing a laudable work with his character and to me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speaking without a supposed German accent!
