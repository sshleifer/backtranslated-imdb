Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so annoying that it's impossible to carry. The best character is Joey's, he is sometimes equally annoying. A girl DJ who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time she speaks. to mention when Danny begins with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. But she's not eighteen, so she shouldn't play by law. ready to pay her the money, but then, Danny, her father bought her and didn't let her raise money because she's not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, would you? Having seen that stupid and childish scene, I immediately switched off the television. Some of the things they say in this series won't even have bought a child. Who in the world can think Full House is entertaining and funny? Every single word they say in this series looks like Shakespeare wrote it. Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except he wouldn't be. It's childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the writing for the full house! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any desire for life or any sense of the real world, I recommend: "Don't see the whole house!" Not even one episode as a try. Run this series. Keep yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst television program ever! I'd rather watch Teletubbies. "Don't see it."
