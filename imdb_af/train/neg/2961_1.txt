I had a family of three little children for a night and their mother gave me a show that they had grabbed it earlier this week at Wal-Mart. All three children became physically ill while they were watching. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all picked up from school, but really it could be this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How someone can produce this caliber of waste is beyond me. Luckily I switched off the movie when I noticed that the kids didn't respond and were warning. For any parents out there, I strongly advise you not to leave young children watching this movie.
