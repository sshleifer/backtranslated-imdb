What could possibly be said about this movie, except, "viewer beware". Christmas Evil must come with a warning label such as cigarettes because it is harmful to my eyes and ears. I'm rarely this dissatisfied with a "b" horror flick, but this movie couldn't even scare a little for a five year old. The point of a relentless lunatic who has a thirst for blood in a movie is that he / she wants to look almost godlike, like nothing can stop their manic rage, but in this movie the resident psychopath gets him into a chimney in a chimney. bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and, of course, to go along with the everyday legend of the santa claus. It is a reminder of the viewer that this man is by no means dangerous, because he is too stupid to be dangerous. All in all, a total waste of film.
