I rented this movie about 3 years ago and it still seems to be my worst movie ever made. I don't think I've ever done it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember having a look back in 1970 and in the jump back there was a man with a polo shirt, a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something I didn't remember. I don't understand how they might say it would be in the 70's. He might also have had a cell phone, I can't remember. It's just awful. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get back to the hour of my life. To this day, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad people.
