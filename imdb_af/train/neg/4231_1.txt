I was obliged to watch this movie all over, as I found it in a bargain and bought it myself, but I often came close to eliminating it and just paying the money I paid for it. write. If you're a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there is one thing the makers of this movie know about, it is the creative use of false blood and body parts for a sickening effect. If it doesn't excite you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot on a home video camera, with graduate props and horrible actors. It is baptized from German, but even the sound is terrible. This film is about the budget that the budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. If they spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and intestines, the movie might have been a bit nicer. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men who lived on an island through an army of tin-masked sadists. They are being caught, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. I call it a narrative story, as it really is a series of torture scenes and battles created with an unforgiving obsession-filled dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that ransom about this movie unless you're like senseless gore. Consider yourself warned.
