Strange, sometimes scary - for me it's the summary of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - page 3. He has no point of view - just shallow, funny digs of stereotypes. What is the film about? It's about reporting a group of people (so-called types) so busy socializing and progressing their profiles - they have no time for anything else. And you're either in it or out of it. Is it that there is no pressure to report daily incidents? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and is only a supplement; Perhaps an entertainer to see who is who and what is what. Don't mix the two. And then there's power play - it'll happen in every walk. So what did you say at the end - nothing - just a few rough jokes that were joined in a different direction, less movie.
