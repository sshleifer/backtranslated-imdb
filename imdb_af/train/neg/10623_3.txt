"Three Brave Girls" is a sickly sweet, rosy look at divorce, remarriage and single parent. Of course, social problems and economic problems have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent who feels exhausted, takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band leader. Even when the author's 'just a movie' expresses the fact that the real issues are not addressed, 'Daughters' suffer from too many incoherent high note songs, children whose personalities do not play on real kids and band leader Hose Iturbi no. Isn't it bizarre that any real person would die in a movie where they were supposed to marry themselves? <br /> <br /> It was released in the nineteenth forties. Only a love of old-style Hollywood romance and comedy can make 'Girls' a tolerable movie.
