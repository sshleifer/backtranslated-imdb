This film should never be made. Honestly, I must admit that I had serious doubts before I saw it. The director is not a great actress, although she has done many films in Holland and the young woman who has taken the most part is a television personality with a constant smile on her face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other lead, I recently saw in Bride Flight and although the movie is better, he didn't convince me. To begin with the story, I did not read the novel on which it was based, but the writing underlining the film is something that could possibly be done considering children with a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon. someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something that was really disturbing was the overbubbed dialogues, it was out loud most of the time. My greetings go to the cameraman, at least he tried to make something out of it. It's a pity that the movie is pretty comfortable. If not, some screens are definitely more credible.
