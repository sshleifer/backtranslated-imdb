Miscarriage happens. Susannah Yorke is a light young Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35. Ace George C. Scott looks and acts like an arthritis 80. Jane's late uncle is in a better shape! He cracks and slacks, stupid and anger. He looks like an ax killer who sent out his ax to be honed; We are not surprised that he likes a woman in the attic! The great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is plenty of darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful and beautiful when he decides to be. He has a good talk and singing voice, a good thought and a conscience he tries unsuccessfully.
