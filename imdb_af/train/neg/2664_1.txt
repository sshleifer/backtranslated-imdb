Insatiable cliched thriller has a young couple researching land on America's most notorious murder sites, becoming road partners with a dim young woman and her snarling boyfriend - who is a real psycho. Arty and alienation, the scene of the film varies between pouty pseudo-irony and stupid flamboyance. Maybe made, but eventually mockable. Brad Pitt's performance as the lower assassin is deceptive. * of ****
