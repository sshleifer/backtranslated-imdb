If you want the dragon to eat every member, you know you're a bad ride. <br /> <br /> I went with many, very low expectations, read some of the other comments, and wasn't let down. Unlike some other cheap and failed movies, this one doesn't really stay screaming (and inadvertently) funny throughout. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS FOLLOW - <br /> <br /> First, plot it is very contradictory. If you look at the "little" mistakes, like the dragon growing up in 3 hours, the whole idea on which it is based is blown up. Look, the movie wants us to believe that the dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that were actually dragon eggs. After explaining it, they show a farmer on one with his fork and dragon appear. Later, the mandatory "crazy scientist" guy talks about how dragons survived the dinosaurs. So probably the people were around when dinosaurs were, or we just had a fine plot hole here. The other important thing is that the laboratory is inflated with a half-strength than that used by Hiroshima. Then two guys walk in later to look everything out, and it's almost unharmed! There is even another dragon, who has grown out of who knows what. All in all, it is very predictable. As soon as the man called cloning, I guessed they would clone a dragon. This means we Smarty pants' security man is not as intuitive and clever as the movie would believe you. If you ignore the fact that I knew this movie would go, you know, dragons. <br /> <br /> To put it aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects". Others called the false rocks falling in the beginning, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little better than a blob, but it ruins everything it does when it slows down the hall in the same way. According to them, the flying dragons in the beginning looked good from afar (although one in the cave is probably the worst in the whole movie.) However, these things are funny to watch. The screens where a million different shots of the same person are challenged in different ways are not. Also, the "introduction" screens with the essential statistics. <br /> <br /> Come to the actors, they weren't the biggest, but I think they tried at least? They were more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent "BloodRayne" and you have to give them points for it. One thing I noticed was that the woman who played Meredith often had her face in makeup, which was much smaller than the rest of her. She seemed to have had a bad run with some white face. <br /> <br /> The writing is bad and cheesy. You don't really notice the music, but it's not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is not to see it, unless you see it because you hear it, it's bad (as I did), although the only funny thing is the bad CG effects . Other than that, don't waste your time and money.
