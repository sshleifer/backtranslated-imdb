If John Waters wrote and directed a 1,000-Corps House after being repeatedly hit with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "The Blood Shed". It is slightly entertaining for the first half hour, but then it slides into some sort of unceasing glare of constant screaming and people are doing things to each other's genitals with electric knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in whatever he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that it won't take most viewers long to forget it.
