Another movie that relies on the trite, exhausted clich√© of the mad scientist, became madder. The movie centers around a surgeon whose life's purpose is to bring the dead ... back to life. I know, I know ... you've never heard that one! Of course, as all these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a manic, bloodthirsty being. For this promising setup, you'd think it would be at least a little exciting. Wrong. Like many movies of this era, the idea is fine, but the performance and writing are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems.
