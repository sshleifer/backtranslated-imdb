Opening scene 'explains' why Hurt is later 'immune' to the 'Infected Man'. It doesn't really mean anything else: How did he get what he caught / what was it / why did it work so fast. Then we go to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was the opener in the past or the future? Of course, it seems to be the past, but for a moment it seems just as likely to be the first place in the film. Sorry, I had to pay more attention, huh? Or maybe it's just done badly. Then there is a lot of confusion about the different job opportunities he had in related fields, and finally a mention of how he had to die from the original experiment. Ha! So did the ns a and private industry come together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects? He must have been one of the leading guys, he's friends with the chemical company name, for God. Then there's the substance itself: Technically a poison, but it mutates in immune 'carriers' so we can have everything we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all kinds of different things in real life. Magic is not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there is the h a z m a t protocol: They jump into a situation without any idea in store or how it is being prepared. Didn't the producers have enough money to show a proper wash after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I thought Hurt was going to die from a bad cleaning technique, and the open scene is expected to be closer.
