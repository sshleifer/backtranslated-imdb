I love filming the 30's and 40's. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than right to love this picture. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, sir, nothing good about this. The only entertaining aspect to me was Colin Farrell's character is an unsafe writer. This script, despite tackling the juicy subject of racism, approaches the audience in the fashion of an ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> The only person who didn't swear he was "acting", Sutherland, and his minutes was little. <br /> <br /> Steel approach to a tired plot.
