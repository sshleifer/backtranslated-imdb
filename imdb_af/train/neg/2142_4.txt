If you're under the age of 6 or 7, you'll really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she sees it. As an adult I can't stand it !! I'm all for prosecution .... when they have a decent storyline. But it is nowhere near the standard. Please forgive me for the slating that is a children's movie, but when you have to sit it almost every day when your kids love it so much, you will understand why. My daughter will see this movie over and over on the same day as we release her. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10 pure because it is my latest entertainment.
