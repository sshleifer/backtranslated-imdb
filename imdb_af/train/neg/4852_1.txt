I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said, "Watch it again, it's better". So I did. And to my surprise it was the second time WORS! There is a word limit, so I'm going to roll the ball here. <br /> <br /> The bombing is all so stupid. Why on earth will anyone wait to trigger the explosion ??? None of the characters here are even remotely. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> -And at the last time I checked in, a car didn't explode from a single shotgun, and a fire couldn't be that big either. small fire extinguisher ... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie ??? The camera is so shaky, I can hardly tell what is going on. The open scene with the robot cut off my stomach, the rest of the movie wasn't much better. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene. The McManus brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") will roll their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why did the man plant his gun where one person was shot? Furthermore, why would he spend so much time cleaning, reloading, striving and NOT shooting the bullets when there was so much chaos around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I didn't mean to sound homophobic, but frankly the scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> -Long for his own good, but too short for the amount of material packed in it. Bigelow seems to think the more action the better. It seems she's wrong - the movie is full of redundant action scenes being thrown in to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know watchers are longer than 163 minutes, but at least the movie hasn't dragged on. This movie, on the other hand, feels more. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was at best satisfactory. But do yourself a favor, just skip it and don't give up on the hype.
