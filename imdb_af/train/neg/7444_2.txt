Unless you are disturbed by Russian people or trees, this movie is a string party. Actually, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of a wonderful Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was rare. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was rare. I'm still unclear about what was supposed to be terrible in this movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, I love movies that use "pidgin Russian" like those made in opening credits. It's been embarrassing for me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all clipped. Oh my god. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you too) this movie has already escaped my brain and I just walked out an hour ago. So I have no specific details, just dusky footage that goes nowhere and a bit of astonishing, now-dead hope that anything would happen. Maybe I saw a completely mutilated version of this movie, because I can't believe it. got such good reviews here (and that's why I saw it) and finally so completely lacking in not just Horror or Suspense, but also Total Entertainment Value. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and didn't leave.
