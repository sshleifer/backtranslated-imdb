This film fails to capture any of the secrets and intrigues of the book. The main point of the book, the insights, is almost not touched, and the viewer is wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big thing about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good at all. No background or personal development does not really let the audience care about what is happening to them, and so the action sequences become flat. <br /> <br /> The search for the manuscripts ends suddenly and without a real explanation <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adjustments to a book I've ever seen. It's terrible and a waste of time. If you didn't read the book, skip the movie and read it. After reading the book, the movie is over and read again. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the point to make the movie discredit the book, that's how badly done and ridiculous this movie is. It is also a shame because it could have been good if they had capitalized on their success and they would probably be able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time, read the book !!!
