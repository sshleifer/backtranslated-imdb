The original "les visiteurs" were original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and near perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for the "worst first sequel to a very good movie." In LV2 everyone keeps screaming, when a gag doesn't even work, it is repeated 5 more times, with a vague hope that it will eventually be funny. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except of course that a parody should be inventive. If you loved LV1, you only see this movie, see LV1 again!
