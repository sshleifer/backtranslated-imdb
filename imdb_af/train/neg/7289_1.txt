This is a film of great appeal to a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not part). I went to a preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The history of a very dysfunctional (often rounded "distorted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should really give its viewers more in the end. Ultimately, photos like this are about human condition - this photo doesn't shed any new light on any of its more meaningful facets.
