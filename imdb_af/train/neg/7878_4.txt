I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First, it has become difficult to decide whether it is a kiddie or adult one, which has caused a strange combination of an adult story and some beautifully violent scenes with a crazy little duck in the beginning give a "funny" moment. br /> <br /> But it's hardly important, the movie is just boring, disrupted and not true to the original story. It simply fails to convey to the picture all the points Orwell is trying to make his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second Revolution? !! Didn't they learn anything? Who is the next Napoleon then? Benjamin? !!
