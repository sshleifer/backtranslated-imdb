A novel by Remarque. A roll that looks like paper. A leftist struggles to stay in Paris between the wars. A Gestapo officer sheltered. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no synergy here. The pieces never split. <br /> <br /> Stories about left-wing refugees in France don't have to be so boring. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or its cold "Dialogue With Death" (ditto). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this movie is in some of the accidental details. <br /> <br /> The chiefs spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any request to have a lot of calvados themselves. It definitely made the movie look like it was going faster. But according to the film, it is only sold in low-cost cheap. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. References to intoxicating drinks come about this; The scenarios seem to be a concern. <br /> <br /> I enjoy movies in France, because it might be nice to wait for the inevitable full-fledged alcohol ad on the wall. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This movie will rate a 10 if we just judge it on refining its beverage walls. <br /> <br /> The movie's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is the best known - if you can call it - for his opera "The Emperor Jones", based on the O'Neill play. It started at about the same time as the movie version with Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. It must be superficial soon; They run out of potentially marketable operas to relive. <br /> <br /> Opera seems to be an appropriate topic to mention here, as Charles Boyer's character functions under his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both prominent roles in the German opera. Is it just coincidence? <br /> <br /> The name boxer just seems to be part of this movie. Note that they are calling on the phone "Himmelstoss". Himmelstoss is one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier "All Quiet on the Western Front". <br /> <br /> Well, the jokes are all in place; guess there was no time to develop a drama.
