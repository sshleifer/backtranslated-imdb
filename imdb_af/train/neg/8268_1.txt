This movie is terrible. Everything in it has been done before. There is nothing original. I can't stand when writers don't get their own plots. <br /> <br /> A girl wishes her on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, sounds like a movie in the 80's, Big called. What's even more annoying is Jennifer Garner's play. She does not act like she is 13 she acts just as she is stupid. <br /> <br /> Then you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it just happens that a friend she had with her at 13 works with her. Wow, how wonderful! But no .... her friend is bad and turns her on and tries to get her job done. But of course she eventually wins when she comes with a "big" idea. <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the movie I saw a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
