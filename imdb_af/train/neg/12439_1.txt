The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90's. The second was just as funny with the same favor and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could continue with the same story as Kevin would have been 17 in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So what does the director decide to do? He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. The child is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of citizens are these idiots? I don't really want to get in touch with this movie unfortunately. But please, I recommend you stay away from it. It doesn't cost you your precious time. Fold a piece of paper, do tasks, balance a pencil on your nose, or take a nap! It is better then to look at "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
