I hate this program: not only is the concept ridiculous, but it is trying so hard to be achievable (something from similar "I confess" ending programs like Muder: She Wrote). <br /> <br /> suck. Why is it that writers in this program can never be intelligent enough to come up with evidence that will make a decision in court? <br /> <br /> Come on: after X years of unsolved cases, why should EVERY SUSPECT, EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * (damn it!) come to a murder that would otherwise be unsolved? <br /> <br /> I bet all the police's wish that criminals were these good sportsmen: "Aw you are a shiny man. I think if you have enough to convince me that I did, I can do it also acknowledge and make it easier for you in court. what can i say? righteous policeman. "<br /> <br /> Absolute dog s ** t and an insult to those of us with enough brain to even i to hear.
