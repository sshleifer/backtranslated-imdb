The cover art (which contains a man with a terrible pellet player) would seem to be a martial art film. (Almost.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the movie's real title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a trademark of condoms in the US) This movie is loaded with homuroticism. If you want such things, then this movie isn't that bad. But consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are many close-ups of actors' groin and stumps, (One scene even includes every actor with an erection in his pants.) The movie is also bathed in gaudie. colors such as lime, peach and red. From the cinematographer's point of view, this movie is a drawing queen! Several scenes contain characters that are very close together and sometimes touch as they speak. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other man in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message here that the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Will I go into battle scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts are caught in one fight.) The martial arts scenes are short and unattractive. No fancy stuff here, just move your standard to see in an old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a car chase scene that could be the first ever low speed chase on film.
