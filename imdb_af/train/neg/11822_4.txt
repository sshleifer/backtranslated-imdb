I thought Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh from the Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, the music by Ennio Morricone. I expected an old school, edgy, Italian cop thriller made in America. Instead, I have a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that made me say: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: A potential cult classic was flushed in the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with a better writing. Oh, and the Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a waste of time, but not a "must see" unless you have a hardcore title.
