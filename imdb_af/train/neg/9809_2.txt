Some wonder why there is no longer Mrs. Murphy movies after this one was not. This is because this movie has blown completely. Disney wasn't the right studio to run this movie. Maybe Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but it will be more mature). The movie is too small, because the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters don't even do the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker turned into a man? He's a girl in the budding books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Wow. And where was Tin, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but to make Disney work was wrong. An animation feature film, perhaps in the tray of Don Bluth's artwork will suit a better Mrs. Murphy movie. Overall, I give it a 2, because at least Disney made a movie of an undervalued book series. But I wish they had done better. Anyway, I still have my books to entertain me.
