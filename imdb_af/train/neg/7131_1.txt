I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and snatch them for their duration. Then there are horrible movies like this. Not only is Redline a bad movie, but a sign that the American film industry may need to use proofreader for a movie, for the sake of the viewer. <br /> <br /> As a stereotype a crap, this movie would emerge from it. The storyline is unbearable, and the acting around is laughable. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst chemistry I have seen in a good time. And even individually, they have to be separated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street traders (about the only thing they legitimately qualify for). Furthermore, how Angus Macfadyen is convinced to do this movie is so far away from me that I can't even think of an analogy. I'm a loyal fan of her, but it made me ask. <br /> <br /> To sum it up. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you are a bigger person than me), so much so that it changes to violence. The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, because it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that is not suitable for human ears. This movie is essentially one big car deal for the first half and an indifferent action movie for the rest. This should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find one positive aspect to this. movie, and I think it is in the fact that the credits eventually roll. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you sang those two songs in this movie, then you're a hack, and I hope that age will ruin you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie, you're looking for a ridiculous experience, listening to the lyrics for Nadia Bjorlin's wonderful songs.
