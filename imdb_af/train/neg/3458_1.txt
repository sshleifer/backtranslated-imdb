Normally I am not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so painful that I felt I had to. I cried at the terribly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughing at moments that were supposed to be tense. Indeed, most of the audience was pretty bored and even talked to the "most tense" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood as the only achievement of any merit in a tortured production. Even the "twist" was not over. I heard it said the movie didn't take itself seriously; but I could find little evidence of that in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cutting should be left on the cutting floor. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
