I used to enjoy Wesley Snipes in several action slots and I expected a lot more, even from a 5.8 IMDb score, the movie failed to entertain and although the story is thin and original, the play is unfortunately thinner and it goes one another, a "worst case" of playing "strong" feelings accompanied by a bad play. Don't take the time to entertain this movie, but if you want to cry, it'll be enough, though your tears are weeping because of the view. Wesley Snipes in the tragic action movie wannabe comedy ... <br /> <br /> I give this 2/10 it was really awful, if you want to see a decent movie, watch shooter or rent it, it's all good things this movie is.
