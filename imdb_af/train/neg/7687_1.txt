I started watching this movie with high expectations. But after one hour I gave up on this movie because it only brought in many unanswered questions about me. It has already started in the opening sequence and has just got worse. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury the Dutch under a statue? Why was an Italian comedian donated? Why did the farmers' wife save the Dutchman? Why didn't he, after being saved, walk for his life, instead of loving the farmers? Why didn't the farmer save the Dutch at a time when the farmer wasn't around? Why did these suspected illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why does the Italian comedian know about the Dutch's gold? Why does he put it in the cesspool in the midst of the farmers' property? These and many more questions came up, and none of them responded in an acceptable way. So I think I miss the point of this movie altogether, and I don't link in any way to the story.
