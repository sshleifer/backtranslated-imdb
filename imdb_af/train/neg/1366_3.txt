** INSIDE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Actually beautiful Sean Young (who, in some scenes, polished her hair, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) is striking in her opening months in this movie. Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to give a bust is her face and body tense and distracted. Unfortunately, when the bust is over, Young's tense behavior has never changed. This is a deadly disabled actress. <br /> <br /> One should only compare Young to the exporter playing her colleague and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what is missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional and at ease at all times ... there is no apparent barrier between what she may feel and her expression of it. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts in the dirty, self-confident way you can expect your neighbor to act when they are suddenly cast into a movie. Basically she didn't have an idea. <br /> <br /> With this huge gap threatening in the middle of the movie, we are considering the implications of the story. For example, after Mrs. Young was kidnapped by the criminal, she dragged into a closet and closed the door when left alone. Granted, she's just dressed in a bra and underpants, but in a similar situation, with a psycho-captor to return at any moment, you'll go to the door ... or take the time to pass through his locker room to go, undress and wear? I would guess that these and other scenes are trying to present some kind of mixed emotions that Miss Young's character experiences, but Young can't convey this kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments in the film, like the brief police interviewing the criminals' past victims, but overall it is a goalless pursuit. It's too bad Miss Young has been replaced by filming the series of comic book films that exploited her limitations with a bit of humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her whimsical while trying to play real people becomes strange. Watching Miss Young try to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad spectacle.
