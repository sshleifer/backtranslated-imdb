Chambermates Sugar and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by threatening dudes while one day shopping and taken back to a secluded island, reluctantly telling the girls about the thugs they last visited when they were ten and there is a fortune . All that is just a movie bookmark, which is almost one long jump back over the girls' first visit to the island and the subsequent battle with a cannibalist family. <br /> <br /> This one has been terribly horrific by anyone involved in the show that I felt bad for the poor Hank Worden who earned much better. As much as I don't like Barracuda (it's on the same DVD), I have to admit that this movie makes one look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: a few tits (they may belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage Ads for Multiple inrywings; and Trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (features nudity), the "Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Wife" ("Nudity"), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive". The DVD also comes in 1978 "Barracuda"
