I'm not sure users should be allowed to review movies after just half-sitting, but I'm afraid I can't just stand for another minute. <br /> <br /> If this excuse for a movie isn't that good, don't do it. I have the late, big doctor turning like a wheel in his grave, I doubt anything. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above, "Not a movie for Parsons fans, summarizes most of my feelings. How dare a director (second rate) director and writer try something that they are so clearly incapable of delivering. What do they think? Where to start? <br /> <br /> THE SCRIPTURE: I thought I'd get a piece of bittersweet Americana. What I got was poorly executed with a slapstick without clich√©. Dumb hippy? Cheque. Stupid fat cop? Cheque. Awful plot contrivances? Cheque. Strangely written female characters? Double check. Total negative for the story you're trying to portray? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that what you look for is a soap and not a very good one. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with Ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville, which didn't move much. Scene with Ex girlfriend who was a bit like last. And so on ... <br /> <br /> THE DIRECTION: My friends and I decided to look for a consideration, it was like a bad episode of Quincy, or perhaps a particularly poor duke of Hazzard . That's how bad the direction was. Terrible jets, horrible camera work, clogs and outs to scenes. God, it was unbeatable. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman who is the most significant recent work, is a very bad BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, this is the lowest common denominator TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> ACTIVITY: Are we so critical now that when a random guy from the TV decides to give up, if he's not that bad , does he welcome his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages each scene. Poor Christina A. doesn't have much luck. Her performance is a car accident (although you do with those lines, I don't know). The 'hippy' in the hearse: o dear, oh dear, o dear. Haven't we attacked since Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I can go on, but I think you get my drift. What I would say is that, like other reviews, nobody on this movie clearly gives a flying damn to The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They knew nothing of the American road movie and they definitely give a damn to try to do something with a particularly decent story from rock mythology. This film was shallow, could not explore and was jaw dropping from start to finish ... oh wait, I didn't quite finish. And I suggest you stay away too.
