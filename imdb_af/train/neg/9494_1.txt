The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who like this movie is that it is managed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire tremendously. The leaders had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a moment can I believe there is anything deeper than lust between them. The story just didn't come true. Add to the saved conversation, tons of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow plot that doesn't lead anywhere, and you have a real stinker. Kay Lenz's naaktonele may be worthwhile for those who are looking for some tasty food, but otherwise it's a colossal waste of time. My mind while watching the movie was that it would be better with the title "Cheesy."
