The plot of this film is not strong at all, many holes. If you approach it as a motorbike, it's not bad, very good cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I'm from the area where it was filmed. I enjoy watching the recognizable places in St Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. This is an interesting historical piece for our locals. It seems as if a movie is made here, everyone wants a relationship. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores because they were all stolen after it came out on VHS. Must get a copy of Japan on Ebay, I find it interesting how the road of the beard is across the town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud.
