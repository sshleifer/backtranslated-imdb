As a youth pastor, I heard good things about this movie. Then I looked at it. The acting wasn't the best. It's forgiven. This is the message that is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change. You'll better tackle, make fantastic catches, stop fucking, start adjusting, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus is cruelly changing subordinates into All-American athletes. I laughed aloud as a coach quoted the script to explain to the kicker why he lacks field goals. But wait, it's not all. You'll get a brand new truck, an increase of $ 6,000, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the state championship, because God helps a weakness to kick the winning field goal 12 meters further than he ever kicked - and in the wind, no less - all because "God wanted him to make it. " Then you will win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus, all their hearts. <br /> <br /> Here's what I've taken from the movie: God can do anything he wants to do when he wants to - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and better. He picks his favorite team and helps them win games. Which Bible is this story based on? I bet Saint Stephen wanted him to know the keys to such a safe life before he was killed. Someone had to make this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed to follow Jesus. That would make them all very difficult.
