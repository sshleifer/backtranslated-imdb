I really didn't enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it at a camp, and we didn't touch it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts touch, but the acting is terrible, the consequences are terrible, and the whole overall film idea is terrible (now I know it was based on a book I didn't read, but I hope the book was better than that, because frankly, I thought this movie was very bad and boring). As I said, I went there with a lot of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I had a caffeine drink, but I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that stopped me (other than my fear of getting embarrassed when I woke up) was the shooting, it was also pointless. I just didn't really like it.
