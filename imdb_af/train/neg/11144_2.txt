This movie reminds me of the lame "erotic thrillers". I stayed late and watched Cinemax when I was 13. I will name this flicker softer kernel, since there is no simulated bump and grinder. However, there is a lot of nudity. The opening screen is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder's emperor (or at least a stunt stump) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the movie and a naked female werewolf that looks like they are. beating a costume on the Munster's. 13 year old boys are happy. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen for years. The shots look like FMVs from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained, and despite the poor quality of the suit, it is shown too many times. <br /> <br /> The plot and play make no sense. There is an oddball story about werewolves and hybrid wolves. The Darkwolf is the latter, but from what I can tell hybrids, the same thing does all the werewolves that one looks like, change to a wolf killing people. The Dark Wolf tries to find a friend, but strangely, the friend can't find it, but can sniff someone who touches it. Again, these skills prove to be less than useful, as the dark winds kill several people who never touched, met or even saw his target. The partner does not know that she is a werewolf and she fights the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You think it will be difficult to waste a simple monster movie like it, but good. Want quality low-end werewolf, hire Dogs soldiers want a ton of T&A that's your movie.
