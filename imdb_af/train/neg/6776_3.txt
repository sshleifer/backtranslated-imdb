I wanted to love this movie. How can I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. But the train wreck that Suzy Parker was, destroyed the whole experience. Her acting was so horrible that I was sitting there with my jaw that was hanging, and didn't believe my eyes and ears. I could barely make it through one look, that's how shocking she is in this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and in fine dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, engaging and natural with a ball. The supporting role-play is right, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its beautiful, retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker trying to speak her lines with a wooden set, a deadly power, a cluelessness that defends simple belief. Who told this being, can she do justice? Oy VEY, people.
