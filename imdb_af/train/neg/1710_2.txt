Each time, a group of friends, with a minimal budget, but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror through the storm. Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and Pals passed with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a coin with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> However, director Todd Sheets and his chums are destined to walk in relative obscurity forever when Zombie Bloodbath is something to go. A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror, this unfortunate attempt (about a plague of carnivorous zombies? Natch) serves as a reminder that while many people have access to a video camera these days, the most do not take It is like their clues to try to make a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that Sheets doesn't have an eye for a pretty framed shot (some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good), but rather a) he has a funny writing. b) he has a common role, and c) he doesn't realize he has a funny writing and role. This means that the final movie is amateurish and probably not looked at by anyone but zombie film performers (like me) or cast and crew members (like those who commented on the movie). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is apparently aimed at using non-discriminatory gore dogs, and Sheets (currently having an incredible 34 titles under his belt as director) definitely goes out of his way to please, with buckets of waste and blood thrown every opportunity. But while these moments are undoubtedly yucky, they are not very convincing and become rather boring. <br /> <br /> So, it's a very bad movie, with almost no redeeming features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> First, it has the single mullet in the history of the movie, as by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The beauty of his baby (along with a mustache) is the only reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it has "pathetic stealth zombies": carnivorous bodies waiting for unfortunate victims to wander through before jumping out of their way to start a bad attack, requiring almost no escape no. The best known is to wait for an hour behind a door and wait for someone to open it, 'pathetic stealth zombies', sometimes behind low walls, or sit in churches sitting as congregation members. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie this bad will get me 1/10, but to celebrate Jerry Angell's flowing locks I'll increase my score to 2/10.
