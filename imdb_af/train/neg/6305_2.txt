It is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on it.) Despite being true, it's still a movie and it's a movie site. I realize independent movies have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't do for all the actors (including the one who plays him as a young man), but act absolutely scary. Admittedly the writing was terribly clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone, as it was done so poorly in each category. Read some books about the true story of the US Mason because they give the men the respect they deserve.
