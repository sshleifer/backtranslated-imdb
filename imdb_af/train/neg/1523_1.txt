This 'Movie' should be the biggest pile of dumb ever seen. What more can I say as BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is nothing to save this 'movie' and I pray that they will never talk about a successor. If you think to look at it, you must know that the storyline is that two garbage dumpers are being dragged to save the earth. Movies like men in black are torn to tear and put together to make this 'comedy', but have completely failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).
