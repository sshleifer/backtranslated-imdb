I thought it was a New York movie: wrong! It is a small British country setting. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama. That means, close to nonsense, even the motives would like to give a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What did I leave? Perhaps, a good actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead police officer is a little invisible to me. The long doctors' surprise surprised her punch, and McDowell delivers a fine as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost dumb attitude. This meekness riddles me, because like other good artists or directors, repeat the same pattern over and over. In her case, regardless of the film, it always seems to be the same character defined by her feelings, her values, which live infinitely different stories. I still don't know how to determine the limit (or merger) between the artists and the works. <br /> <br /> Another positive side of this movie is the female touch and the interesting different views. The women each have their own lifestyle, even though they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be seen in as many ways as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is pretty visible, but the big final cuts the desire for another vision.
