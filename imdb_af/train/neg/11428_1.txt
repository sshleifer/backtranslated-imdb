OH MY GOD. THE WORST SH * I have ever seen it. This is the main idea I watched after the movie. And I really don't understand anyone with an opposite myth. Although, perhaps the idea was good, but the effect is unfortunate. I mean especially the role of H. Graham. What was it ??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of producers. The character was played in an affected and annoying manner. Every time she appears, it reminds you to watch a movie and destroy a spirit of the moment, then the whole movie is because most of the time you can see there, her stupid faces are having more stupid attempts to create. Terrible, don't waste your time.
