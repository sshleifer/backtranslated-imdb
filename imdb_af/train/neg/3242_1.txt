Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from start to finish. I threw popcorn on the screen and designated me as a la MSF2000. The plot depends on accidental events and relies on the stupidity of people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls to a man and it doesn't happen to her that she might be hurt ????? And she's rich ???? And she is a well-known psychologist ????? COME, people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone comes together to talk about her? It was so advanced that it felt like banging in the face to even half-minded movie viewers. Rainman would have been insulted. I also acknowledge that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion some people have for carnivores, starters and fur bearers. My hatred is so complete that it upset logic. But I'll give it a shot. It's not supposed to sound really good. I do not care. That's all everyone is talking about. Mamet cannot create characters; All he can do is void his voice by different actors. No wonder his actors are like wood. They are confused that everyone has the same character. (But his later films improved.)
