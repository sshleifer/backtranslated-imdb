This is one of the worst movies of the 90's. I would not recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This photo offers African Americans as ferocious, immaculate, violent, non-artistic, reefer smoking sociopaths. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his homies are constantly disrespectful to others in the dorm, not only the white people but also the Asians, and are never disciplined for their actions. Despite all the tolerance, they keep crying and crying about the evil white oppressors who walk their lives and stand in their way. In fact, it is Fudge's influence that causes Remmy to bind with the skinheads, to fall out of college, and eventually kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The skinheads are presented as a faithful group of underperformers who are a way off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never blow their music to irritate people, and they do not police. They commit serious crime such as battery and rape, but they are not as repulsive or threatening as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes) are. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of material in this movie that almost offends me or giggles me. Some of these are as follows. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are set as students at the University of Columbus, but we never see them in class and it is quite unclear how they pay their tuition. One just has to speculate that the weeds they smoke have something to do with their finances. Although they are students who look like a private university, they cannot express a single line of proper English. Their characters are only developed by their streak and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It seems drunk Kristen (Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunk Billy had taken her to his home. She even asked him to get a rubber so they could start. The fact that he had penetrated her without a condom became a rape while it would only be good sex if he had one handy. Later, Kristen was assured by Taryn (Jennifer Connely) that she had no liability in that matter and jumped on a man's bed despite a man's bed, she was not ready for sexual intercourse and is the sexual predator malicious use. Then she met a week or so later and slept with an ultra-sensitive doctor who knew how to rape and bring a condom. The director emphasized contraception thoroughly. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely and completely wasted that black people look like pricks and women look stupid and weak. Cole Hauser's play, and Laurence Fishburne's accent, are the only reasons I can think of seeing it. The author / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit your own by looking at this crap if you like, but remember that neurons don't grow back. Follow the advice at the end and FALSE.
