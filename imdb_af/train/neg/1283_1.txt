I must say the first thing I watched was this movie about 6 years ago and I actually enjoyed it. I recently bought the DVD, and when I looked at a second look, I wondered why I liked it. The acting was terrible, and as usual we have the stereotype clansmen in their fake costumes. The acting was at best terrible. Tim Roth did an OK job, like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange thinks. <br /> <br /> The plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed in the movies. Braveheart was even worse, what these movies are just saving grace. But seriously, people didn't talk like that in those days, why should all the actors have Glasski accents? Just another movie to try to capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I see the only people here who say this movie is good are the Americans, and to be honest, I can see why they want it, I know they have a surprise for men in Kilts. However, if you think about buying the DVD, I want to spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
