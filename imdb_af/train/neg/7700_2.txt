I saw the movie at home last night, but I thought it was too long. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too much of the text to even have in what I thought was a comedy-type movie like the rest. Things are not funny in the movie: fianc√© beat his girlfriend, beat. The movie was too long - talk about how to sleep and wonder when it will end when you wake up and still play! Some of the things at the reunion were too much to catch - as the lady sings - I felt like I was watching a spiritual song show here! come on Perry, you can do better!
