The previous poster obviously worked on the movie. It's a joke, how bad it is and no one will see this kind of movie as he did. With all the actors' names and what they used to be, it's a sign that he's somehow involved. <Br /> <br /> It's currently on Cinemax and I was sure it was a movie where porn stars (the one named Ava is beautiful and kind) were forced to make something different for a crazy tax return. <br /> <br /> Even when I first saw it, I was sure it was made in about 1986 and I was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... it was made in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Although I'd call it one of the bad ones, it's good movies. Like watching a train wreck.
