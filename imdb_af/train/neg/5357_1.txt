I don't know where to start. This movie feels very much like one of those cheap Saturday morning children showing that they had brought back early nineties early in the eighties. Kind of Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital deliberations and really cute sounding "secret agencies" and villains. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little continuity. Someone just threw a lot of scenes together and forgot that there would be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early, when several villains have an explosive device in an agent's car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly set as "remote explosion," the bad guys decide to chase her on their motorcycles as she drives away. This chase continues. All the time with the bad guys do ridiculous and totally useless bike racks. Stand on the bikes, make wheelies and so on. At one point there is an accident and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike. We saw the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents' car, but the rider disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the rider and bicycle come back ... apparently unharmed by the accident. At this point, even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers prefer to shoot the agent while driving, and blow up her car. It was also clear with cgi. Sounds confusing? That is, and so is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can point out that if I say cgi, we're not talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here. We're talking about the cheap Cheesy Power Rangers type CGI, actually I think it would have been better on Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd did this movie, I will never know, I can only accept them for money, as a favor for someone or because they were thrown in jail ... probably the last one.
