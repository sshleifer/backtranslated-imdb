Another good movie by Costa-Gavras. This is a good idea of ​​the situation is Latin America and the US involvement with Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the US was very much involved in coups and support for Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the spirit of the movie follows the typical left / communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, he suggests American actions as brutal and inhumane, while Tupamaros's extremist activities represent something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the US became involved. Europe is filled with poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls producing themselves as it happens in most Eastern European countries. The US was doing a dirty war and God blessed us all the monster of Soviet Communism was defeated. It's a pity that the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. It's not an idealistic world like Costa-Gavras and Matamoros do not believe. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt left ideology of past times and tries to be as idealistic and morally successful. correct.
