1st watched 6/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir Pete Riski): Weird psychotic film about a girl with autism being tested in hospital, flashing power, and then hell breaks loose. I'm honestly not sure what the filmmakers intended on this one. What we get for the next 1 hour and a half (that was at least no longer) was a twisted horror / twilight zone / zombie party / ghost movie that didn't really make sense at all. Initially, after the power goes out, everyone misses the hospital, except for a small group of misfits, including the girl and his father. There is the typical annoying character, a creepy old man, and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course, the young girl after which the main character gets attracted. Random things start happening at various times like spirits and monsters that appear, an indication that time has ceased and the dead people like this little group are trying to escape whatever they are. Of course, the autistic girl is at the center of everything and I really hate how they used this girl's misery and insinuated that she was the cause and put it in a hospital farm where people are being cared for. We never really get the answer to what is going on? It's very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to get an hour and a half, it won't be confused for you or any filmmaker. What a waste of time? Really !!
