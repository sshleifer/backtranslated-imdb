Describing this film as garbage is unfair. At least it can be by means of garbage root, an absorbent hobby. This movie was not absorbent or entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can do a great job, and so it certainly had an IRS bill to establish when he agreed to this horrible script. The crazy scientific story of 'Hollow Man' was told before, was better told, and was told without using so much ridiculous expensive effects. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects appear to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls men, women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK, they are marketed as 'The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)', where they may have won the title for this movie. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, frightening, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
