POSSIBLE LESS LESS SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie is billed as the first Russian horror movie. Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, "The Hitch" (his Russian title) will place a place of dishonesty in the gallery of terrible Russian films. It is based on Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy", which is a classic in Russia. "Based" is the keyword here since no familiarity with the story is required. Instead, the less you know about Gogol, the better. <br /> <br /> It's a unique production because we're very used to directors who take stories from other cultures and adapt to their own culture. The flood of American remake of foreign films is an excellent example, but Sturgess has again changed Kurosawa's Seven Samurai into the Beautiful Seven with amazing results. Kurosawa transferred Shakespeare's Macbeth to Japan to make an amazingly powerful throne in Blood while King Lear became. a sounding Ran. But with "The Hitch," our Russians transplanted a Russian classic story to American territory. The film was shot in English in English, with the purpose of using it in English using American actors and fairly synchronous lip movements. <br /> <br /> As a natural consequence is lost the colorful Ukrainian background for the story. In an American small town, a deadly appearance comes from an outdated horror book guide. Gone is the boozy seminar Khoma Brutus, instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win the Pullitzer Prize, and at the same time writing about X-Files-like events and regular Boobs girls. (I never thought that Pullitzer Prize was given for that kind of writing, now I'm humbly corrected.) In a strange nod to Russian, the journalist Ivan Berkhoff is called. They had to call him John Smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, clichéd and generic than this movie. <br /> <br /> Berkhoff goes to a town called Castleville, is stranded on a dirt road, bumps up until he gets a dilapidated house and is not quite welcomed by an old crown. All who are in the guidance of a radio announcement on the powers of evil at their most powerful, and people stay in better and avoid water. Do I have to mention that it's really raining really hard? After a few so-called scary scenes that made me laugh, the story dressed as a priest as a priest, he got a priest and the local sheriff told him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest for pray her. three nights. At this stage, the action begins. Those who have time to kill are welcome. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Everything starts with the dialogue and up to the support section. The dialogue I heard in Russian was originally originally written in English, and it is composed solely of clichés and platitudes chosen from American films. The actors struggled just as clearly with English because the timing of their speech was working and unnatural and followed Russian dubbing. The acting is mostly frightening, and not just because the actors often find it difficult to talk, but because they do not approach a variety of facial expressions. For the most part, they are just empty or you wish they were. The only exception is the sheriff who is played by Lembit Ulfsak, ​​a fine Estonian actor, and Arnis Lizitis who plays a wheelchair-bound Castleville resident. Oh, and a cock of course that's absolutely natural on camera! I know actors complain that they are performed by dogs and cats, but when Nikolaev is shot by a cock, it is a sad testimony to the overall quality of the play. <br /> <br /> There wasn't a single moment in the whole movie, and there wasn't a single original moment in the movie either. Note, this comment comes from someone who is quite inexperienced with horror. The film is filled with standard movements used in horror movies since the genre's inception. At a critical moment, the camera hangs lovingly on a kerosene lamp. The lamp goes out quickly. It should also have seen some horror movies. An example of the highest idiot comes at another moment, a character jumping out of a bath and walking at the camera. He wears something that looks like loincloth! It doesn't become idiotic anymore! <br /> <br /> Those in Russia who liked it claimed it had to be advertised as a mystical thriller. I wasn't excited too. It was from the beginning to the end. I especially enjoyed the whole population of the village behaving as if they knew exactly that they were living in a horror movie, except that they were not quite sure whether they had zombies or not. Therefore, some of them acted zombie just like in case. <br /> <br /> The makers of the film say it's about finding faith. Such fine collections of idiotic acts, stupid faced moments, and yes clichés, do not deserve to find faith. The film is so thorough and completely fake, it just deserves an exhibition in a wash figure museum.
