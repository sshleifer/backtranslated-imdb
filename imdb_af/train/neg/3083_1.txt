... Bad to be deliberately bad ... <br /> <br /> This jewel shot straight on the MST3k big screen. While it goes without saying, the movie doesn't try to be serious (hopefully their purpose, anyway ...), the movie is pretty bad. Hell, it makes Leprechaun In space look great budgets ... <br /> <br /> In short: paint my muscle car pruning!
