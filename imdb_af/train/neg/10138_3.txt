Over the years, I've seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies, and each one has the same amount of entertainment; Unfortunately, the level of entertainment is low. Sure, the action sequences were amusing, but it was pretty much it. Seagal was really in his best at filming; Under Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least on the action standpoint), but over the past ten years, these types of films that Star Segal really did not meet his past qualifications. <br /> <br /> On the more positive side, the movie used good time, such as some of the action ranges and the use of white. Just when the movie was apparently just getting up, a nice cool action scene brought it out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more of Segal's movies would do better if he were not the only one to admit fans in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movies had these well-known supporting actors and actresses, the movie might get more popular results.
