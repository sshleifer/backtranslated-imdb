Err ... this movie sucked. Very. <br /> <br /> I read some of the other reviews. Apparently, there are many people who think that everything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good. <br /> <br /> I watched several of his films, in the little hope I miss something. But no, they just suck. Poorly written trash. The characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention stupid). The plot is ... I think it's mysterious. Not sure about that. Mr Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, on any other movie you saw of her. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, check out this movie. If you are less than 50, don't bother. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen and you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical. I don't know what to say.)
