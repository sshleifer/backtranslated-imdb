Let me start by saying that I can only enjoy any bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation of the 1970s. Seriously. This one was quite awful. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino is trying to inject and nothing works (except for the crocodile) which is very good. There are, of course, some ignorant Westerners who settled somewhere in the jungle. I don't even remember where it is happening ... how sad it is ... actually people come to the resort to see this indigenous tribe and its ceremonies, but in the end they upset the "Alligator God" of the river going continued to go on a rampage, killing holidaymakers and some tribes as well. Sounds good, yes? Well, don't get your hope. There is minimal violence to the end, the special effects are so bad. It was like a kindergarten class they performed and the love story thrown in was laughing. There are a few scenes where they seem to make a camera underwater in a swimming pool and throw a toy alligator like an arrow in the water and it's supposed to attack the gator. I'm not joking. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a match guard is hit by the incredibly sinking plastic gator, which is suddenly five times larger. (A few minutes ago he was just big enough to eat one, but now he's crossing a full truck ...) It's very pathetic. The only other movie I can think of where the effects were so bad was that I pulled out of the story, was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, "Rats," with the plastic gears on the conveyor belt and all those who were not scared. /> <br /> Normally I would say something Sergio Martino was a good must see, but this one is a must-have. Save time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + sticker price from No Shame. This one is a SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
