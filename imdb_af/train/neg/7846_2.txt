You know, I went to see "The hills have eyes 2" that like it. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was pretty entertaining. Of course, they had more money to throw than West Craven did for the second time on special effects. Although I still prefer the original movie, the remake is well done, and it was a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a big popcorn movie for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> What brings us to "The Hills has eyes 2". Man, where do I start? The plot, or lack of one, is paper thin. We are not exactly breaking new territory here. The army decided to monitor the area and all these people were missing. So what are we doing now? Let's send in the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we must make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever. Well, I've never seen that premise. To shorten a long story, you killed the mutants the once-off graphic way. Again, the special effects of Nicotero are great, but death no matter how graphically boring, and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this movie was just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic, but I predicted it, sowed it and didn't fear it at all. For me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought. Where Craven and his son shared the writing duties, and he was involved in many of my favorite horror movies, but unfortunately it is not one of them.
