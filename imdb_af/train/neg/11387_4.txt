Medellin is a great place to live, work and study. I was there twice, and I never heard of guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists hostage or something of the sort. There is "invisible police" but it is not * a Big Brother system. There is just enough police so they are visible in everyday life, but they don't struggle for anyone without good reason. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary because the youths who portray it in the movie are his characters. Film directors carefully watch plot lines under the daily action of La Sierra residents, and when a "character" dies, there are real pathos. However, it is hard to imagine that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro, a gang terrorizing La Sierra before the Colombian government restructures the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not an accurate portrayal of life in Colombia; Of course, there are things to be careful about, such as small crimes, but if one considers in the "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia doesn't look that different. Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show the world that the once-war-torn country is now more than ever prosperous.
