Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) leads this well-meaning but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) to find his scientific cousin (Ryan) with ordinary man Tim Robbins to enjoy and enjoy her in the 1950s. To leave Ryan Robbins late, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the movie falls flat with curly situations and stupid dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the tremendously supportive team do their best to keep this silly comedy, but can't save the movie. It is unfortunate that so much talent begins in producing such a dark film. I wouldn't recommend anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
