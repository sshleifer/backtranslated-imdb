It wasn't what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD and under the movie I was irritated and turned the movie off for a moment. <br /> <br /> I didn't like her: <br /> <br /> 1 They shot at the dad <br /> <br /> 2 The stems were very annoying. <br /> <br /> 3 The dinosaurs (mostly) looked at the fake <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist, it was good, he was annoying <br /> <br /> 5 The picture quality on the DVD was really bad. <br /> <br /> What I Like: <br /> <br /> 1 The music by Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have the bootleg soundtrack of this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it is good for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs, they inspire a kind of awe. <br /> <br /> 3 Baby is kinda cute when in the water and playing <br /> <br /> 4 The funny scene with the tent. <br /> <br /> 5 The children who see this movie will hopefully learn that evil is always lost.
