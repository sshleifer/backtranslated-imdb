A cheap exploitation movie about mothers is looking for her daughter who was kidnapped by people who make snuff porn movies. The trail leads the mother all over Europe looking for her child and we are struggling to sleep in the audience. <br /> <br /> This is one of the many soft-sleaze movies made for people who want the thrill of porn with the stigma or danger of it on their credit card account. I'd rather have the stigma of staff, as those movies tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. It's supposed to be a sexy thriller, but it's not. Usually she speaks about things that are followed by much walking from place to place, and leads to lead. Throughout the film, several people are getting out and everything has more than a touch of S & M for the proceedings. The violence and fetish material is of the kind to challenge laughter rather than horror or even excitement, it is so incredibly fake. Worse, there isn't even enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basic par for the course for many of these movies) <br /> <br /> You will forgive my lack of detail, but it's just a boring, boring movie I stayed at, and hope there something wise will be acted upon, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was the blonde haired villain with the big remnant and nose, the size of a Buick. I watched her with a morbid fascination, wondering how she looked like a young girl and wondering if she had plastic surgery, and not the kind of things you should think of in a gripping thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
