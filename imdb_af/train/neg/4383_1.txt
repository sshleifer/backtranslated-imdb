The worst Bob Hope comedy ever (and it also includes heavy competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud to be in a bath with a geisha girl driving his ship. Someone has definitely managed this hope hackery over the cliff as it knows Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can't get any laughter or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
