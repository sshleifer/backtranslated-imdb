Just saw it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs, unless you have sleep problems. It's a film full of pretensions - it makes a slight quote from "Hiroshima Mon Amour" and it's all downhill from there. Camera works - think of a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story Line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles 'The love I saw in You Was Just A Mirage' extended from 3 minutes to 2 hours, but full of repetition. For the pangs of sad pain, this film is ranks with the benches in the Methodist Church that my parent dragged me when I was a child. I want to pay 2 + hours of my life. Julian Hernandez's promoter suggested the show commenting that the film was "controversial" - only for the film's narcotic effect.
