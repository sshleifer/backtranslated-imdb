As if the storyline wasn't depressed enough, this movie shows that cows are slaughtered graphically in a butchery for five minutes while the main character tells her early life as a butcher. Strange good. Then there is the core priority of the hero / heroine who fetches and cuts his dick because he is at work saying he would have been with him if he were a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic youth did he have? Just that he didn't accept it and had to live it with nuns who initially loved him and later hated him because he was unfair. He tries to explain the reasons he did, but it is so difficult to empathize. Such sadness and unusual self-destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was it really about?
