NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. But not good. The plays are on their way, away, away, signed out. The sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long. The movie that was edited up to 2 hours and 10 minutes would have been exceptional, but unfortunately it has become so annoying that I can only give it 2 out of 10. This is well below average. <br /> <br /> Some other issues also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree. The guy who has played the great looks nothing like him, but the grandfather, father and son (who constantly give us unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bald-headedness. No one seems to notice that each of these children looks like a clone of the last, although photos of them are broken every turn. This one is a minor, but if the film wasn't 3 weeks, it wouldn't be so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany has been whispering for a long time does not mean Jews are rounded off and sent off. Some words would have been to them and the thought of running would probably be discussed. The uncle in France would surely have sent warning to let them go. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You always spend this thing for us and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... married. Then you have children. Then we record things for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships. This would not have been so much in a 2-hour movie, but with the time we spent, nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The end was just bad. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but you won't like it ... unless you're sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / writer must be tortured to watch this inflated garbage. A weekly basis, I mean endless loop, oops they are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie, I think Istvan Szabo should model his government career to him. Long stretched movie ruining any fabric in the movie. A brief description of 'The Horse Whisperer' and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start watching while the sun is shining, it will probably be good after dark when you leave.
