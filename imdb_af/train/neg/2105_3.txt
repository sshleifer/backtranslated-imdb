Bela Lugosi as a creepy, insane scientist who uses orchids to eradicate brides in order to steal life essence for older women. The midget in this movie is hilarious !! Many freaks, plus a lot of padding and no plot make this movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces finally coincided in a typical Hollywood way. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you look. <br /> <br /> Usually, I will deliver drill rigs like this one, but the miniature just added enough creepiness and entertainment to get a few points.
