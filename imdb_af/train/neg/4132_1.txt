Characteristics of our early 21st century cinema can draw different evil creatures and bad guys against each other. We haven't seen these things since Godzilla v King Kong and so on. Always sound good on paper if you are splintering and in the blurry of good things you have an inspired idea and see the whole game before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to write it. Big ideas like all vampires are feminine. Ergo warm, seductive deadly but in a way I would like to perish. And all the zombies are men. Well, what are men like a woman, just after she's been immersed or cheated right? So it all looks good to really make it. Then the mess starts. Mosters fought. Nothing much happens. Another fight. Philosophical noodling and cabling. Eureka we found how to win. Great battle again and end. Sounds good, isn't it? If it became an Indian company, it would be great. But it is Hollywood for the money: shine instead of what the fans want. It could have been all beautiful.
