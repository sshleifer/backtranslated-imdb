Normally, I wouldn't feel like reviewing something I only saw for half an hour, but I'll make an exception to this one. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the bad man's lines: "I smell ... teacher!" "Sorry, teacher! You get a" F! "" <br /> <br /> Bad old and bad girl (immediately after killing 2 police and stealing a bus full of drugs, they get hot and heavy): </ br> <br /> He - "So, how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders?" <br /> <br /> Her (purr) "You know how to show a girl a good time ..." One generic child who ran for his life instead of helping someone, she gets life and personality in this summary. "I'm a CHICKEN-TWIT! (This was the American network version). My old man was right! He left us ..." Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Not really a spoiler) Bad man (on fire) shouts "Aargh! Fire!"
