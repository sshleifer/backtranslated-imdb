1st watched 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that isn't really enough to explain how the real story happened in this fact-based incident of a man who was wrongly jailed to work Don't get his family to make Christmas happen to them. The three children in the family then leave the house on a train to Washington D.C. to instigate the then president of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This draw features some lace stories such as their positive hobo encounters and a puppeteer, making the story like a Disney animal on the flight movie and not quite fit. Eventually, no details were given on how the President helped the family and it is, in my opinion, another downside of the movie. The movie eventually brings tears, but it takes too long to reach it. The movie is not supposed to be an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but does it have the obvious fades that make it look like this? so I'm not sure their information is accurate. All in all, it's a simple movie (which could have been more complicated) with a happy Christmas story, but in common and without much substance.
