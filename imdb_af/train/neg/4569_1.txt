I can't believe the Muncie congregation is so much aware that they will embarrass themselves by doing this show. This show is like a slap in the face of real hardworking law enforcement officers. I have never seen anything so stupid in my life. If they announced it as a comedy, it would be one thing, but to say it is reality is nothing but a lie. I only saw it once and was horrible about what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy with a bad guy come in a footprint. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the police chief and all the officers have to shame their heads and never have to admit that they are coming from that city. No wonder it didn't stay on TV
