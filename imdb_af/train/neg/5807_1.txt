Don't be bothered with this movie first, it's bad when it's judged on its own merits, but compared to the original 1972 (which is a classic) it's rightly right. And VAT, someone pointed out that the 1972 movie is bad compared to the book. It's stupid, movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. They are two completely different art forms (as if it were necessary to point it out, but it does appear). If you used these criteria for all movies, "2001" would suck and it would also mean "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
