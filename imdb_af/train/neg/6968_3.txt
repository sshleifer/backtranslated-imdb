An older man becomes a flower in his wife's greenhouse, which seems to fade away. He is cut by it, or bitten by something on it. He quickly becomes ill, and at the hospital, large white white larvae spit out. A later attempt to revive him with paddies leads to a bloodshed. <br /> <br /> A policeman is at the hospital because his partner has been severely injured in a shooting. Somehow, the policeman is brought in with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist being brought in. There are several young children walking around in the hospital, which I suppose we should find surprising, but which is extremely irritating. They happen to wander in the room where the monster is held, and happen to collapse a growth hormone on it. Horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> The thriller grows and starts breeding. People walk away from it, and sometimes for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by military who are willing to destroy everything if needed. <br /> <br /> There aren't really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time people seem to be looking for the monster. It was pretty boring. Obviously, it owes something to the Alien movies, with the monster being born inside and with several stages of its growth. There is also a character called Bishop, and the main actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
