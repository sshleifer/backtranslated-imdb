Ruth Roman's real philanthropic gesture to entertain troops coming from the Korean War on an airbase near San Francisco, started with the overall Warner Bros. greeting for patriotism and songs. Many celebrities make guest appearances, while a love-hate romance develops between a budding asterisk and a painfully green and thin plane (Ron Hagerthy, who seems to deliver newspapers from his bike). Looks like the Corporal has deceived the actress into thinking he is fighting when he is actually part of an airline staff flying to and from Honolulu. (You will think she'll be glad he remains innocent, but instead she acts like most childlike women in the 1950's movies). Doris Day is the first thirty minutes or so, and her clear songs are very enjoyable. Roman is also here, look glamorous, while James Cagney enjoys his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his attractive baritone. Jane Wyman also sings in a hospital bed show to Doris Day's head, causing one to wonder: "Did they walk out of sets?" For unforgettable viewers, an interesting look at another time and place. Still, the low rent production and just enough technical aspects make "Starlift" strictly second-eyed. * 1/2 of ****
