Well, leave me a new word coin here: Polyphobia: The fear of polyamic relationships. It's still in a long series of movies that start by stimulating the audience of some kind of trio, just to go on a thumb and preach everything about how it's oh, and that's the only moral thing to do. find monogamistic solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the joy of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: a few decades from now polyphobia is just as big a faux-pass as homophobia, but guess what was too close to realizing it? Right the first time: the producers of this movie. And so much like it. Why even make a ridiculous conservative and old-fashioned movie like this? To emphasize on the limitless openness of gayness, it looks completely like the fact that we live in an era where monogamy changes in successive monogamy, which in turn turns into swing and polycym. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> It's a disappointing chick spot. (But damn, I have to say, Heather Graham is the cutest thing in life.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
