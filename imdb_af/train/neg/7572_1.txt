It felt like I was watching this movie a thousand times before. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story tried to get a little distorted. Every time I waited for something interesting, I didn't see anything I expected. Like "The bread factory opened another facility because there was not enough bread". In two words: flat story, which became a clich√©, bad acting, bad special effects ... Only the stupid Russian policeman Vlad was a little funny while punishing the bad guys. The hope of muscles was so incredible that it made me laugh for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time on that shame-of-a-movie ... It won't get worse (because it's not possible): D
