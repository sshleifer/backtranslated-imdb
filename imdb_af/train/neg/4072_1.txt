I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not ours. <br /> <br /> I'm LAZY. <br /> <br /> I usually see a bad movie and curse. It was so bad, I actually did a review to save others from the totally boring mess I was sacrificing. <br /> <br /> I break my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is too paralyzed to clean a room. So boring. See 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has a little bit of merit as well as entertainment. This slime looks awful, is terrible, and everyone who made it must feel terrible.
