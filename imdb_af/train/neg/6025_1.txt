Behind is the kind of "we know what we know because we know it" film that Christians (and most other naive people) need to help them feel like they "think" and "believe" (not "KNOW" is not right. But at the same time, I feel bad for the guys because it's not a well-made movie. It doesn't help any message. I work at a video store, and I KNOW the only reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was. Anyone on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong unless they think they know they don't know. I had about enough (but only after I had too much) of these people walking around with their noses and thinking that a movie that is a semi-talented TV actor means something to me. <br /> <br /> If you like yourself, you stay away. I refuse to go into any detail about this movie (not because AI didn't see it (because I did it), B-it was too shocking for my atheist himself to handle (because it wasn't), or I really don't have anything to say about it (because I'm doing it.) The reason (which is a word no one helped to understand this movie) is that I want this movie out of my mind I want it made from my head I want to have opened everything from my head, I want the message that Kirk so proud and coach at the end of the movie gives me from my head. what was in my head BEFORE I see these movies, everything that is directly related to this movie swinging in my head is GET OUT! My peaceful anger ends. I'm sorry someone in this world went to the theater for this movie to see what can happen in the future (but not) when they love those Seven Dollars Plus to any number of Human, Animal or Rain Forest could have given instant. But if they did, they wouldn't be able to "BELIEVE" in the fact that it really is, they may need to know what it is. Left to zero (from ****)
