I raised my whole life with Scooby Doo, my dad grew up with Scooby doo. We just got an idea of ​​the first episode of the travesty called Shocky and Scooby. Which planet is Warner Bros allowing these societies to fly air. The characters could be better drawn by my younger sister. The story could be better written by my 3-year-old twin cousins ​​(who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are just not !!!!! If someone other than Casey Kasem does the voice of Shaggy, it's just not people! trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was disgraceful. What's New Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format. Put this piece of garbage and go back to real Scooby
