'Blue Desert' may have had the chance to be even a half-way and more pleasant thriller. The main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox), was not so stupid. When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, the comic artist Roberts moves to a small town from the West. In her first days there she meets suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this part well) who will eventually leave her side. While scared of her safety after being in the situation twice before, she has a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously friendly town chief, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, who doesn't seem sufficiently convincing enough, unbelief among viewers who would otherwise be convinced of the red herring thrown by the authors). Smith needs Roberts co-operation because, as he tells her, Atkins is an ex-con and guilty of sexual assault. But the police lacked the evidence to remove it before. <br /> <br /> The movie had plenty to do at least to make an interesting movie, because soon enough there is so much confusion over who Roberts should trust. However, much of the intended tension seems to be compelling because Roberts's character never responds to simple things as we think any reasonable person may have. And with her delayed responses, much of that tension can be easy and unconvincing, especially in the final. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; Too baby faced in ways that kind of remind Kevin Anderson's persona in his character in "Sleeping With the Enemy." Or if Lisa Roberts is a stronger character, it can be so good. Meanwhile, the movie is not as good, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
