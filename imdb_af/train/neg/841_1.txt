I watched this movie just 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just looked at. Mainly, I think it's a movie about an internet S & M "star" from CD Roms that is about as realistic as movie carts online. She was killed by someone who caused her sister and a squad of 2 FBI agents to investigate death. The Big City local killings division, USA, is also investigating, although most of its work is looking at the CD-ROMs, which it claims to be as realistic as the real thing. I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie who has any kind of credit behind him. He is in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of them are hitting the head girl for apparently no apparent reason. I won't even explain the end, because frankly, I can't make it myself. But before the final scene we are treated with a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the movie. Honestly, they could have run the final scene and it would have the same effect with the cross-eye direction and everyone. <br /> <br /> All in all, stay away from this movie. I did it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I could have used something else for those 80 minutes and was more satisfied. Like, play that game with a knife where you repeatedly stick to your hand. It will be much more fun for 80 minutes.
