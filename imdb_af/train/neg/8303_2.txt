Since its release in 1983, a Christmas story, the Jean Shepherd story of his alter-ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. However, "My Summer Story" still has Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely nothing of the charm, and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original movie. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is actually a mishmash of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories, which include hilly neighbors and battle tops. Charles Grodin, who I normally like, is extremely untouchable in the role of the father (more adapted by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never appears to be anything but compulsory. Kiernan Culkin is a poor replacement for Ralphie, and the little brother has been forgotten here.
