As an actor, I really like independent movies, but this one is best amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermont for a public service, but when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree. Were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again delicious palm trees. <br /> <br /> When boys leave VT, they can't believe they get a ticket on any major airline, as the plane being filmed is Federal Express. Have they skipped themselves in a crate? Come on guys, little details like this separate indi movie of totally amateur. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is far beyond Arthur with his bleached hair and tie tattoo. The two had to change roles. <br /> <br /> The underage characters are ridiculous and despise something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause for directors to make a gay movie, but watch your places and go next time
