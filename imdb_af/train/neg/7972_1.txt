I love B movies .. but come on .... it wasn't even worth a degree ... The end was dumb ... b / c THERE WAS NO ENDLESS !!! Not to mention that it does not come to life on its own ... I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ?? Slowly than hell and then they just kill the characters one by one in like a 15 min period ... and I won't even start the thing that kills one man without his head ... and then you see not even what Jigsaw does with his so-called "new puzzle". Unless you have nothing better to do, I look paint dry before recommending this God-forsaken movie to anyone. otherwise ... oh and make it even better the other movie totem, you can see the man throwing one living creature in the basement scene out of the window. It was funny like hell and probably the only good part of the film's degradation
