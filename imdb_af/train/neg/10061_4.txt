"The Curse of Frankenstein" is true to Mary Shelley's story for one word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were any good. The tragedy of the creature that destroys Frankenstein's family is completely cut out and replaced with ... nothing. The heart and moral center of the story is gone. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a refugee he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a level checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even taken on its own terms, it is garbage: a meager, rambling movie with dazzling creatures with a pudding scale cut. Being the first of Hammer's horror movies, led by Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee starring, his place in horror history is safe. But it's crazy.
