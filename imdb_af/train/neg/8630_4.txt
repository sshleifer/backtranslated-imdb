I know there are other things in this episode, apart from what I'm going to discuss, and in fact I think it has many virtues; For example, having had a very negative opinion of Jin to see Sun's flashbacks in the "House of the Rising Sun", we get Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me so uncomfortable that it made my whole enjoyment of the whole episode very muted. Previously, in the scene where Jin appeared on his hands and shirt with blood, Sun's father was shown to be someone rich in shady, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was even a boss; Mobs work in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable opportunity. In this episode, however, we learn that Sun's father is actually the boss (or top executive) of a Korean car company. And what Jin did was physically attack a government official who was actually going to be murdered. on my behalf. <br /> <br /> It can be very pleasing to me, because I work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPEKTAKULARLIK offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing continues in Korea. ; those big, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model for this fictitious car company because it is the only one that actually exists) works with these mafia-like methods, rather than any ordinary West car company. It's just amazing to me that the writers will have the gall to write something in the story, and there's no revolt in Korea. It feels like weird "Buy American!" propaganda, depicting foreign car companies as criminal, unreliable, third-world outfits.
