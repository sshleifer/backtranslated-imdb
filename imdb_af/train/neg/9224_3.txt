Style, but no dust. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as it wants to be. <br /> <br /> It's another role in the genre of movies about the troubles of movies. A young filmmaker is hired to complete a 60-year-old sci-fi movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a scary movie maker. He is not an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. Almost original. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside of the Jeremy Davies movie maker are as thin as rice paper. Characters that may be interesting, such as his dad, his dapper, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director, are introduced and then shown the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of candy but when compared to other filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 movies, it is compared. The movies are funny, challenging with well-developed characters. The movies have lessons learned outside. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be comedies and camps, but it's just distracted and there's no funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a call but what is the satirical target? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I'd rather have a full version of the Code name: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the environment, as evidenced by the visual humor of the sci-fi movie within a movie. But he fails to share why we should be amused. <br /> <br /> Outside the sci-fi movie, it's just a mess. There are continuity errors, the movie maker chooses a sci-fi weapon after it's already selected. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene, the filmmaker is confronted by critics who complain about the lack of story, lack of a point, a scene where he recognizes empty cleverness does not mean that he did not address that criticism. <br /> <br /> I think your Roman Coppola can get away with a film about an anxiety-hidden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and eventually doesn't say anything. In that sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would watch it at Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Look at the 15-minute code name: Dragonfly movies on DVD as extras and then send it back.
