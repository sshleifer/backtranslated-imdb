This movie was a great disappointment in direction, intellectual level, plot and in the way it dealt with its subject matter, painting. It's a slow movie set like an episode of Wonder Years, with a terrific lack of depth. It also fails to deliver his message in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> The approach to painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as "beauty". According to the makers of this movie, 'beauty' can only be experienced in Bob-Ross style kitsch landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (such as primary school) color theory and lots of sentiment. In parts the film is offensive, eg. At one point it is said (rather celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally retarded people are unable to have or express emotions through painting. By definition, their works are worthless 'bullshit'. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how the movie can get such high ratings, and so far, many people haven't rated it, and they've only selected very high or low grades.
