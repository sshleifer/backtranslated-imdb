As soon as I started seeing and hearing posters talking about this movie, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was incredible to watch and I couldn't wait to see the second one, especially after I saw the trailers at other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater very disappointed, just like many other movies at the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were wonderful as always, there were simply too few of them. In the first movie there were constant battles but the second had a much more (and very unfortunate) prehistoric point of view. To sum up the plot, there wasn't much that wasn't expected. The machines dug with Zion for the purpose of destroying it (it's not a spoiler, everyone saw it in the ads). The dialogue of the movie was absolutely terrible. Unless you are a major in psychology, you probably won't get the most from what is said in the movie, and so it just won't mind. It has become somewhat of a romantic movie showing events happening in the lives and relationships of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, as bad-ass as he was in the first movie, looked like he had to get all religious and ministers. Personally, I don't have to hear or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of my time, and I don't think I can see the first one anymore. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me interested in the movie quickly, and the small amount of good fighting pushed me closer to the edge and the end of the movie moved me right. Which movie ends with "To be shut down"? How original they are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to fix that one. Finally, the movie was bad and that's the end of it.
