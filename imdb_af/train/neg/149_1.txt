Well, you know the rest! It must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I can only imagine Stephanie Beaham having to pay a few bills to take this role. <br /> <br /> The lead role is played by (for me) a complete unknown and I can imagine disappearing just back into uncertainty this turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led the martial arts in the early 70's and since then fighting scenes or martial arts must be based or at least brutal when using street fighting techniques. This movie uses quick cuts to show off the martial arts, but even that can't hide the fact that the woman doesn't know how to throw a punch. An average 8-year-old boy will dismantle her at this exhibition. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery here is how it hasn't won the golden raspberry for its year.
