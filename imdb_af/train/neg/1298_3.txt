Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right circumstances, but Gojoe tells the story of a fighter monk and his only competitor, a face of the Genji tribe. The film features the key features of low-budget production, including vague combat scenes and awkward settings (the kind you can find in an under-manufactured dorama). The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his fate defeats the mysterious spirit that preserves the Gojo Bridge in the night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring him almost every element of society - but what earning him relief. <br /> <br /> There is, however, no absence of ambition, in portraying the conflict between the saint and the worldly. Artsy thrives in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose-film style. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
