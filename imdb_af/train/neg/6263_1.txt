Henry Sala's Nightmare Weekend is a rotten sludge from Troma. It's a youthful, messy and silly low-budget horror movie about some teenage girls spending a weekend at a mansion. The professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme. To perform a brain implant. She uses a brain implant to turn her victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a totally brainedad garbage that contains a lot of nudity and a few cheesy gore. is terrible and the writing is completely incoherent. Why such a crap is widely distributed is beyond me. Perform this as the pest.1 out of 10.
