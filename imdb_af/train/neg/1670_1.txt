The film's prospect is haunting: a woman becomes pregnant when she is kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie starts, a terrible opening image is found to be a C-type Sci-Fi TV. Movie. It's a great Star Trek and some X files, but more than anything else, it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie kicks in, everything is predictable and clickable. It looks more like a 2 parter in a bad Sci-Fi TV series. No tension and no excitement, but not for lack of trying. Only very predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
