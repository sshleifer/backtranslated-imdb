This film is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and James Belushi's presence suggests it is a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The launch of the ridiculous female head, however, begins a number of ridiculous plots that hide little from the constructed end. The film moves between comedy (description used loose) and surreal drama with some out of context adult plays being thrown in. The main woman (the Angel of the title) has been poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the writing that has some incredible, extreme character to be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one who handles his part well, but is also dropped by poor writing. One to avoid.
