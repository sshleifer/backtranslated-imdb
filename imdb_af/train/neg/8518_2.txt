I'm surprised at how much commentary this show is about how "really" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's a big top. <br /> <br /> The play is the enthusiasm with chicks and the sites have holes that you can drive a truck through. This is not where I actually call it. <br /> <br /> It's so serious in his desire to be "relevant" to show just how cut-off Rob Thomas and his staff are. <br /> Overall, I found that at best it was a snooze fest and in the worst more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell seems to be a good actress, but it's hard to tell with the over-the-top style of the whole show.
