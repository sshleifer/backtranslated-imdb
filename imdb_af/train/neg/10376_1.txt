I watched this movie during a preview at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film producers and directors were attending, presumably to try our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes made the audience hear it, it would have been good if it were a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience wasn't scared, the filmmakers seem to be. They postponed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they would cut it again; as far as I can tell, they didn't. It was the same horrible movie, just a year older. <br /> <br /> It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow and dull.
