What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of dirty, dirty, temperate, misanthropes living inside. These people, who presumably work on complicated scientific projects, do not even seem to survive the death of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers: An exuberant scientist whose main skill is "learning" and "sinister stars" has cloned a dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on these kinds of things, the other scientists were shocked because they were apparently behind in their experiments and were trapped with their pants. The rest of the story is like the thing, or ten little Indians, where the staff are hunted and murdered as they try to formulate a way to relax and defeat the "dragon". The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon. All it looks is a gray blob. The acting is less than terrible. These scientists act like a lot of kids who can't consider anything, and it makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, and so on. Dean Cain is barely better than any of the role-players of unknown actors in This movie. He seems to sink to the level of his supporting role. This movie is really a pity. The acting is bad. The story is stupid. The CGI is very cheap and amateurish. There is nothing commendable about this movie, it's not even a good killer to watch while doing work or other work.
