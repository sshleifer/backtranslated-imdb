Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends groom-like orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance / hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to withdraw the glandular juices to keep Bela's wife forever young. Some secondary actors who play detectives are trying to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi makes it beautiful, but you can say he needs the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is terribly dreadful, and most of the actors would have been better off waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell someone what happens to them and they tend to laugh a lot and claim to see the movie. I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a fairly accurate valuation. Anyone who pays for it will be out of their minds.
