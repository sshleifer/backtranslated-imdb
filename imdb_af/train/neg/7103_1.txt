This is the best way I can describe this movie, which focuses on a newly married couple moving to a home pursued by the man's first wife, who died under mysterious circumstances. It sounds good and good, but what spells out is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things about this movie is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie that promises a free coffin to everyone who dies of the horror. Well, trust me, no one has ever accepted the offer, unless someone is frightened by plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and doors that are turned on. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music that seems to be played by a sixth degree. And you will find out the terrible secret that is so clear that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie think. Someone dies while running and hitting their heads and the police are never called to investigate. Yes in the end it is a slow pace (which is really bad, since the movie is just over an hour), boring little story, which is easily cleared by the average person. Apparently, none of the characters in this movie were the average person.
