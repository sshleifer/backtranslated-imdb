Where to start, there is so much wrong and terrible about this movie. I'm not sure where to start. Well, the two stooges that this crapper wrote. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first they could not make their so-called thoughts for a name. My guess is they divide the difference, therefore the capital letter BRAIN that will not die, but the end screen says HEAD THAT DO NOT GO. Nobody knows anything about the medical profession. After all doctors oath to "do no harm". The death of a woman for a head transplant will be considered a damage. Plus, a little thing that matches blood and tissue. Rejection will spell death for Jan in the pan. Plus, which holds a plaster sample. Which medical school did Bill graduate, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name, it made hell out of me. Plus, the brilliant surgeon, Doctor Bill Cortner, doesn't know how to keep a patient calm? All in all a disaster of a movie, it's incredibly stupid and unavailable, except on MST3K. I give it the thanksgiving Turkey.
