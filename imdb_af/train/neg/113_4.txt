Today I found that they offered "All All Laughed" on VHS. It was a very old and widely used VHS. I didn't have any information about this movie, but I like the references mentioned on his cover. The names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten especially attracted me. The price was very low and I decided to go and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the 6.0 user rating was an excellent reference. I watched in "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow ?? four stars! So, I decided I couldn't waste time and see it right away. Indeed, I just recently looked at "They All Laughed" and I have a very boring over-rated movie. The characters were poorly developed, and I spent many minutes understanding their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes falling in love with the women they chase), but I didn't laugh at the whole story. The coincidences, in a big city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as a handsome and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if she were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions are definitely the presence of the Playboy center fold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband, beautiful after the release of this movie, and whose life in Star 80 and the death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story "; the wonderful beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, future Keith Keith's life; the always wonderful, even fifty-year-old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song" Amigo ", by Roberto Carlos. I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60's and is called by his fans as the "King." I will only keep this movie in my collection because of these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Very Low and Good Luck")
