Wow, after you scrapped the Timo Roses "Roetestad" slide after about 15 minutes (South Park is about more than meaningless curse ... I think some people just don't get it). I was interested in this movie. I read quite a few positive things and the packaging and appearance of the movie was far from the total amount of garbage I was expecting from the route. <br /> <br /> Surprise: The movie is not total trash, but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of the German Horror / Splatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and the containers. This means "Barricade" is very greedy and detailed in parts. The Gore FX is not really credible, but OK, the acting is OK, but in some cases it sucks. The chicks in the opening series are ridiculous and do not get better until she is shot. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the movie is gory, has a typical German underground atmosphere (including classic booby shots in blood), OK FX and a modern feel like the packaging that already promised?! <br /> <br /> 1. The font is the total BS. You get a typical hillside / lose in the forest story with a few guys + gal who camp and meet with a degenerate hillbilly family. Everything just leads to torture / mutilation and seems incredibly random and useless. This is the first thing "Barricade" makes half-hearted. <br /> <br /> 2. Randomly also the perfect description for many of the camera work (I played the repetition of the tweezers in the extended booby torture.) Whether they have no material or the editor is working " a hardware store. Even worse the editing ... sure, she is modern and much better than many other movies in the genre, but she's RANDOM. You have over-exploited the typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning ... it's just there ... all the time. Then there are some grainy / noisy movies that are thrown here and there, for the sake of it, I don't get the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the aforementioned effects, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most of the deaths were edited with several repetitions of sting and punch. It's OK, but here it is annoying and fake, especially at the end. Annoying also knows the "music" that is permanently used without any change in the background. It doesn't take long for the movie to become unbearable. <br /> <br /> 4. From this all comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a brilliant movie with trashy, it feels nice to polish it with special FX and new school editing. They seem to make it too serious. It's not fun, because the decent Gore FX is messing around in this context. And where the classic Gore FX is OK, the computer FX looks in scenes like the sting in the mouth or the shots in the end, quite stupid (and 3D spatter mostly sucks me in movies with budget and decent 3D artists ). /> <br /> I often wondered if the time of serious explosive films is over and "Barricade" is just another example, it could be time to put it in the grave. It's not fun, has no character and is too trashy for its appearance. The script is a cheap try on "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" that doesn't lead anywhere. You can take it literally ... the end is just there and as random as many other things here ("I love you" in a flashy movie ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to take a lot and fails ... you can surely fast forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid face melting, nipple pinching and classic Friday the 13th style sting of a couple while in a tent grab (bloody boobies whore!). But it's really hard to get through this. Total failure, especially because you can see it could be something.
