I read the whole book a wrinkle in time and then saw the movie. The film contains all the elements in the book, but as the book was 190 pages and the movie was 2 hours, it really got too much effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin must work together to find Meg's father and get off Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie is really a stinker. The acting is terrible, the direction is laughing, and so far the situations are not needed. I was really bruised to see the same person, Madeleine Engle, who wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book and a horrible movie. The acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting. Yes, I must admit there were cool effects. But seriously they were all terribly done and not in any way serial. If you read the book you will be broken by the movie. I wish it could give a 0, but unfortunately I can only give it. 1. A half could have been useful.
