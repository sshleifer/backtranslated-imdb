The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo didn't look very good and I couldn't understand half of what she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays his normal untenable role and Constance Bennett is just like that, except for some of her funny screams. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young. I just saw her in the crazy roles she played from the late 60s to 80s, and an old old woman. Story-wise, the best part might have been the last few minutes when we see a stuntman doing great things on skis, and pretend Douglas falls on the slopes. These were amazing and humorous footage. <br /> Overall, I can see where this movie - Garbo's last - was not a cash success. It just pulls too much, goes ahead and deals with deceptions. This is an annoying story. Garbo also knew it and closed it.
