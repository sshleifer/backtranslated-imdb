To be honest, I didn't watch the original 'cry', but the scenes I saw made it clear that the first cry was a good movie. so great that seven terrible successors had to be made. They started with "Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf". I had this movie on VHS from my uncle some time ago when he gave away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. I watched it last night, and it wasn't really BAD, it was just strange. I mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and pretty disturbing (but kinda hot), Christopher Lee to stab a dead guy as if she were a vampire, etc. , this movie was actually like a kind of mish-mash by Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) said about the werewolves getting rid of every other vampire movie has. In the heart, garlic, the nightlife must die at night, and the ruler of the werewolves live in TRANSYLVANIA. Not much for the acting, but the worst of it comes from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at one time or another in the movie I chose to root for the werewolves to rip her throat, because the deadly throat always had to say something. Anyway, the plot is very stupid and clich√©d, so there is no real point to tell you, you can just read about it on Wikipedia. Incidentally, the thing that really makes me this movie is the fact that it is the only movie from all seven successors that is in any way related to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which is a remake of the original, or in other words, a successor based on the same novel). so this movie does not see. there is no real horror, almost any werewolves, and just a frightening special fx. 10/03
