Probably encouraged by admirers of her much better "Orlando", Potter here, in the worst case, delivers herself a vehicle: she writes, directs, stars, and actually writes the music, including a mawkish love song. The movie looks a lot like a high school or college project convinced by a teenager that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are so fascinating to us. But Potter's character is so indifferent because the object of her romantic obsession is unlikely, and the whole film is an embarrassment of narcissism that is being celebrated as a celebration of the tango. Maybe she didn't work if she didn't throw herself. She just can't act, whether she's playing herself or not. Pretentious, excessive, dull and stupid.
