If you look at it without an idea of ​​what the story is about, then you are surprised. Even then, the synopsis painted a rather sensible story, but the real film is nothing else. <br /> <br /> As the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessive mountaineer, whom you will see as the prologue for opening credits and crawling, telling you about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city in dreamy manuscripts of the spirit exist (note itself? it spells problems with flickering lights), where its inhabitants desire immortality for a change in their ubiquity. They can see our world and see the mountaineering of all people and explain the synopsis that they have decided to contact him through alchemy. It creates an intelligent atmosphere to meet the man. <br /> <br /> What it translates is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old child can produce. Created shapes, though credit goes to the stop motion style, and puts it through an ingenious loop. And repeat until your eyes start closing, then move to the next scene. The Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls. They constantly play the magical sphere, and play a field day to give it to the "other" world. It doesn't get any better if the man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotic boring and sleep-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thanks, of course, that the duration of the shorter time is than advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) by the 70 listed. While it is firmly dated, its dull colors, non-existent story, jolly soundtrack and repetitive images won't win over fans. Don't waste time.
