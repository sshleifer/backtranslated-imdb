I think it's probably one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the same characters with different people is * such * a bad idea. If they couldn't get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this one, they only had to cut their losses and have said that. Instead, they get new actors who are horrible about what they did. I felt seriously playing at a high school or (bad) college with the leverage to act on these people. <br /> <br /> Where do they get from these people? Was this their first movie? It probably looked like that. <br /> <br /> This movie also parallel the original in a few lines. I just watched the first one and watched # 2. I was all excited to see the second one and it was the worst show I've seen for a while. I hardly ever * switch off a movie, but this one definitely went down after about 30 - 40 minutes.
