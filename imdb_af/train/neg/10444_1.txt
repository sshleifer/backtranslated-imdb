The only thing good about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I didn't expect Citizen Kane. I expected Independence Day, a movie that was pure popcorn fun, but I called the horrible Roy Liotta movie, Turbulence. Yes, that's how bad SOAP is. . The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the first name for the movie, it wasn't even a glimpse of a snake or plane. 40 minutes in the movie! What a false advertisement! If it wasn't for his title, SOAP would just be another memorable cheap B-grade summer movie. And the R rating? It must be the most undeserved R-rated movie of all time! The makers of the movie only add a few f words to make it an R. All the violence is held on pg-13 level. You know what's really R rated? The R-rated superstar Edge! See him at Summerslam instead of wasting your money on a snake!
