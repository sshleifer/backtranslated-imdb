Most book adaptations are bad, but this movie left out important parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters. They recreated the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order. They gathered ridiculous things that never happened in the book and would never happen. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book before, it would have been an incredibly dull movie, it didn't care for you. about the characters, like them or do not like them. This makes the characters jokes. <br /> <br /> Terrible. <br /> <br /> Rudiculous. <br /> <br /> Two hours waste of my life.
