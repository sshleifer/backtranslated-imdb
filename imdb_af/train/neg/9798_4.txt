15 years ago, Power Rangers were one of the shows that defeated the nations, especially those of the youth. When I was a 3-year-old child living in the Philippines, I will watch ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there) every Friday. When the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe when I watched it with my father and 2 uncles. My grandparents even sent me a Balikbayan box full of Power Rangers material (including the easy-to-use Megazord figure and the stuffed Rangers toys). I even played the video games and just loved one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was VERY sad. Anyway, this was the show that puts a stepping stone on my interest in robotics (especially anime mech series such as "Gundam"). Now that I am 18, I would like to think this show is now nice to me. To prove this, I downloaded a trip by purchasing a 2-series DVD collection with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watching both. I was like, "Oh, how terrible. Just another rubbish on the attic for me." For you all of my generation, it's NOT a show you want to see over and over. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not bad, is it? Instead of Power Rangers, I would like something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (also known as Ninja Robots), or even the original Sentai programs that were the basis of Power Rangers, recommended.
