*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Are all the teenagers who suffer from an original drought? It looks so terrible. First, it is a noble point of departure that can be applied well. A rejected young nerd growing up, stealing and killing all the girls who put hell out of the torture when he was high in the junior? Can't say you had nothing to work with. But this movie goes through the same movements as all the other recent slashers. Everything from the score to the camera angles lets us know exactly when a false alarm comes and exactly when the killer will strike. We now know the pattern. These silly slasher movies are pushing the credibility movement more and more at the moment. Let me ask you something: Who in their own mind will surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, brave mortuary in the middle of the night and just surprise her from the blue while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does it make any sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only innovative from time to time. One good shot is the victim of Denise Richards' character. She gets trapped in a pool and the killer mocks her with a chain saw. There are some good songs in the soundtrack, including a cool track by Orgy. The music video is included in the special features section on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the acting is mediocre at best. The actors all sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal of the title character on "Angel." Denise Richards, however, is a good actress, and she has a rock level through the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is as you would expect: pretentious, indisputable, forgetful, cheesy and without a good sense of fear. Don't bother first. <br /> <br /> My Score: 4 (out of 10)
