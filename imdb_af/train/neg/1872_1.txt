BE WARNED. This movie is such a mess. It's a disaster. Don't waste your time with this one. I warned you! <br /> <br /> The acting, story, dialogue, music ... basically everything is so over, it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous. It made me throw (if the dialogue / acting / story didn't do it, all of them are suddenly shot). You will feel like you are watching a comedy. The problem is that the parts that are supposedly funny are not even funny. The play, story, cinematography, you can feel everything, try WAAAAY too hard - but it never succeeds in it. Almost every shot is canted, but so what? This movie just feels like a student movie. No wonder they shot it in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money shooting it on film. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused or like poor acting, writing, editing, directing, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced into your face, oh and did I mention bad acting? (Well, it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!) Then I think you'll keep this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to look at it for a class. I would have switched it off immediately if I could. If you can't tell, I hate this movie. It dropped me and gave me time back ... at least I didn't have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, is in this movie, but he has since gone down - accepting roles for movies like this disaster.
