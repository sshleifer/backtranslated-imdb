I don't usually comment, but there are things to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> The acting on Jeremy London's part was horrible! I didn't think he could be so bad. The plot could have been good, it was well aimed, along with a good solid performance from the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read and thinks it has great potential for entertainment, but is disappointed from the start. <br /> <br /> Well, I have at least good laughs. I won't waste my time if I'm you.
