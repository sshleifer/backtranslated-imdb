A family moving into an old house in Japan. But there is a catch that followed it (BOO !!!). Aw, does not mean to let you jump. It's just a review. Sit back. Ahem, now it's all haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and her lover in slow motion. It obviously spans a 3 minute scene up to about 7 or 8 hours. Horrid story. But how bad can you ask? Well, it was so bad, my brain started melting my nose and licking in thoughtful drops. It was so bad when Doug got McClure on the screen. I prayed that I had Flash Wonders of Small Wonder. (Yes, I know Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "Little Wonder", but it's actually the same damn show, & I can get the "little wonder" theme better). There are movies that are so bad they are good. it's not one of those <br /> <br /> I've seen it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My Degree: F- <br /> <br /> Cookie Cookie: Mako Hattori Get Topless , Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one nude, one net topless) <br /> <br />
