I basically swam through the movie, but just enough to see how the plot was over. To tell the truth, it was very boring to me and in some places it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of strange. But still warm. <br /> <br /> But despite the warmth of CHACE, it didn't really make the movie. I think the plot is not that bad, but it really rushed me, the fact that they hold together like every sentence. Is it so hard to pronounce your anger without saying the F word every time? The pillow was annoying and the whole flashing thing that had my face made me headache. <br /> <br /> Although the plot was OK, I found the movie to be a drill and a dramatic one. That's why I just cut with SCACE in the scene. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless you were the hard-fucking fan of a particular cast member like me. Oh yes, the role was hot. The girls were hot !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST !!
