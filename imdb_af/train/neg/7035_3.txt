Extremely thin 'plot' of satanic rituals or such a mumbo jumbo offers the hokey excuse to bring together large amounts of sex scenes. Straight vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S&M, bestiality, incest, and some other sexual proliferation, all get their time in the spotlight. The problem is that the storyline is so dull that the turbulent sexuality becomes quite boring after a while. Who knew that a movie with an intimate goat / girl encounter could be so boring? Well, now I do. <br /> <br /> Eyecup: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line offers T&A (both regularly displayed); women viewers sometimes get penis. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extra "and" Sister Street Fighter "(also the same DVD contains a second feature film" Evil Eye ").
