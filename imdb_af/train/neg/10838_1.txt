The moment you give a 1/10 'movie,' you have people baying for your ignorant, half-finished, artistically delayed blood. I won't try to justify how I'm not delayed by aesthetically challenged, by listing all the 'art house cinema'. I liked or mentioned how I gave an unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explains me the point, purpose and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> Here's how I will list the movie: The opening of three unattached urban legends that are almost absurd levels of co-appearance. This followed (in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain): A children's game show host who dies of lung cancer tries to solve things with his cook-addicted daughter, whom he or she may or may have raped when she was a child, and who is being harassed by a clumsy police officer with relationship issues, while the match's strong captain decides that he does not want to be a failed children's divide, a fate that has yet another of the match show took place in the 60s what we see is now an unemployed, homosexual in love with a barman with socks and money needed for 'affirmative mouth surgery', while the producer, who himself dies of lung cancer, asks his male nurse to help him patch with the boy which he left years ago and later became a female self-help guru, even if Mr. Producer's second wife suffers from guilty feelings as he has deceived a dying man. and o, finally it rains frogs (you read correctly). And I save you the incredibly long and useless, literally rattling monologues. Every character seems to come on the fly, because there is no drive or reason other than to make sure the movie exceeds 3 hours and as a 'modern epic'. <br /> <br /> You probably think I could do a better job summarizing the movie (and it wouldn't confuse you) if I wrote the damn thing a little more coherently, maybe in " some sentences instead of just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
