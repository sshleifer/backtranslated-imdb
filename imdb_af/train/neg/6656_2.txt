It gets a two because I liked it as a child, but it has become so redundant that I just hate it. I can't give it a descriptive review, because it will be one thing after another, I probably won't say nothing else. <br /> <br /> The only other aspect of this show is that it's pretty nasty, with the child with the cut child at the dumb walking around and over. I have a cousin who likes this show and he is the strangest and dumbest person I met. This show must be pulled out of the air. It's always the same thing over and over ... They need better performances on Nick. I really get tired of such things.
