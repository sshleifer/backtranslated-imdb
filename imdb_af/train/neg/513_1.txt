Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he apparently only went through the movements. He arrived, talked to his friends on the film and took a big salary at home. It didn't matter to him that the product he represented was purely crap. <br /> <br /> No movie marked it out more than "Stroker Ace", which "Cannonball Run" looks like a classic and "Cannonball Begin II" looks viewable. Save for some racing scenes there's absolutely nothing to see here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson makes it as bad as a stupid blonde, it is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the thought of Burt get it up with Jim Nabors and so dress like a chicken, it looks funny then it's your movie. Otherwise, choose almost any other movie comedy and it won't be worse.
