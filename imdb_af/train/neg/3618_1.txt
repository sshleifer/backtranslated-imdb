Clich√©-famous story of an imminent divorce - or is it? - by the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no payout, either emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> Does anyone learn more creative writing? The true sign of a poor storyteller - if you can't create a kind of satisfactory denial, just shut the story down. I'm obliged to ask, "What did you think it was a story worth telling in the first place?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted, debut by children's actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was at its best forgetful. And they wonder why no one is watching movies! It's ninety minutes of my life, I'll never come back.
