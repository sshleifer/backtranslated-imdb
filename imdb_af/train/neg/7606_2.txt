Beverly wreath was born at the wrong time. She was an actress before her time, and even made power and grace to such a lame movie as the Corman films she played. In Gunslinger she is the wife of the town keeper. He is being sacrificed, so she takes over his work to pursue his murderers. She is better than the material with which she works, by far. The movie is gray, stylized and mostly boring. There are some (unintentional) humor with the band tracks everywhere, people walking behind one building suddenly appearing in front of the other (I've heard of false fronts, but it's ridiculous!), And the really silly tomb of the new widow sheriff falls in love with the man who is hired to kill her. Even if she didn't love her husband, it was just like a week or two, because he died! And she finally ends up shooting the man dead. No luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is another woman, the saloon owner. She plans to buy a lot of land, only if the railway goes through and makes her rich. Her plan of action if it's not quite lame - she'll steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle. Hell, it's just her and her rented gun at the end of a whole town. Do you tell me these people aren't armed? See what happened in the real towns of the Old West when bank robberies robbed the bank, then it was hacked into a hail bullet by the armed and dangerous city staff. There is a lot of useless talking and driving, between a few lame shoot outs. The end is as horrible as usual in a Corman movie, though thanks for winning the moral proselytizing at the end of the world. The sheriff turned over her badge to Sam Bass and drove off in the sunset, though the movie was so gray you never saw the sun.
