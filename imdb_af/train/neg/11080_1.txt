You should love the cute low-budget movies. This one comes down with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). Plus, every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister), I think, "Watch out! She's a vamp!" - For those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with a bad taste and money wants to waste, make a movie, the little one that has been spent naturally. I don't know if I feel sorry for the author of the movie or the producer who has not returned any money. <br /> <br /> I would say it is good for small children in simplicity, but I don't know if I want to put a child on it ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1 / 10 because it is the lowest it goes.
