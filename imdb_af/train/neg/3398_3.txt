It seems that the intent of the movie was to show the aggressive (mafia-like) character of Russians, or at least of the Russians who could travel outside their big country. that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police are so ineffective that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank, even when these subjects leave the air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues have probably spoken a language not yet identified by Aliens in the Urals, but by far the Russian. So, Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, go to Moscow or St Petersburg kindly and teach yourself to learn Russian language grammar and its pronunciation.
