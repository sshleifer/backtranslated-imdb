Personally, I loved the 1995 forecast. As always, Christopher Walken was wonderful, and although the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror / Fantasy movie that had a lot of fun. This inferior 1998 successor is still worth looking at, but mainly because of Walken. Walken is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors and he is once again outstanding in the role of fallen archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time. Again, the war between false and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the heavenly war. As I mentioned above, Christopher Walken is again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, "The Prophecy II" unfortunately also contains a lot of terribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel irritated me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however, was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who didn't want to lock up. However, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The whole movie is very sad and well shot in dark colors, which greatly contributes to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is further impressive and one of the coolest moments in any of the prophecies. Prophecy II, however, is the worst of the three prophetic films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken one-man show, entertaining, but nothing about it.
