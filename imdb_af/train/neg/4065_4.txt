... by the similar mind of Eric Stanze. An unbelievably talented director played a not-so-good movie, but I still put myself to the final credit, but nothing more than to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After she caught her (although she was willing) and threatened to have sex (another event she was also willing to do), he revealed that he had kidnapped three guys who were wronging her in the past. have done. He then decides to kill her (huh?), But gets filled and dies instead. The girl's mind snaps (or something) and she rages her on the miserable pits in the basement. <br /> <br /> Well, the script sucks: it's been windy for a long time, loaded with ten cents and there's WAY too much of it. <br /> <br /> The play sucks: what a minute, acting? <br /> <br /> Filming sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemetery material is just a damn insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... 'budget', that was the punchline. <br /> <br /> Yet, there was a charm for the thing. Back in the 70's, this kind of movies in theaters came out with real budgets and talent attached to them, but not at this time and age. If you want to see this kind of violent sexually disruptive trash (don't lie, do some of us) then it's all you get today. Some short the better items on the menu. <br /> <br /> It's not good and it won't be remembered, but not since the boom of Joe D'amato, people made such movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
