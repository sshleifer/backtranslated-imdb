I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes which I think is the shockingly bad movie. It fails on pretty much all levels; The film is at its best, the act at its best and the plot has no depth, and I feel completely apathetic about the outcome of any of the winding story lines. <br /> <br /> Plan B has nothing of the charm. this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself on the different points where the writing makes its regular wrong meanings all the way to the comedy. <br /> <br /> A Bona fide saccharine poem from a movie.
