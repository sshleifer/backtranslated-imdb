This game was made by Sega. Made by Sega, I didn't expect much, but I didn't expect this litter either. To begin with, the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your way to get around. The motorcycle is the worst part of the game. When you enter something, you just stay there and you don't move. You never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter. The main character barely speaks, even though he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are terrible. You drive through trees on your bike. The camera makes the enemy impossible. This game won't even be worth renting.
