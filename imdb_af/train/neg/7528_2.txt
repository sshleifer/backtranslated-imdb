It's even worse than the original game of death. A cut, incoherent story leads to 'Billy Lo' falling from a helicopter to the ground and killing him, as we follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So we don't just start with some Bruce Lee clones, the film kills one and we follow another thirty minutes in the story. The main reason for this one is when Bobby Lo is fighting a lion, which of course is a man in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome, but his screen time is very small. Mainly looked at this and the original Game of Death because they are part of the Bruce Lee boxing set. No wonder they were included in Lee's completed works. No one would buy them differently.
