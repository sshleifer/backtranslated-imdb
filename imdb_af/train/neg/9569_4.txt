Certainly not terrible, but certainly not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Loved Country (1995) was arranged and written by Darrell Roodt for the screen by Ronald Harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). The film is James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about pre-apartheid South Africa and the stories of a black man and a white man falling together. The pious, but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) received a letter from Johannesburg saying that he should come immediately; He later finds that his son killed a man. Rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a black rights warrior, is the one murdered by Kumalo's son. This connects them. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to the 1951 movie of the same name, because I didn't see it. Or the 1974 musical title Lost in the Stars, because I didn't see it either; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I saw; It has a lot more urgent air on it, as it actually tries to say where the movie is crying, the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I enjoyed the novel more than I enjoyed the movie), because novels and movies are two very different media and there is no point in conveying or passing directly to each other. do not compare in the same way. <br /> <br /> First, this movie blows. Well, I think it wasn't that bad, -Five-out-of-ten - but it wasn't that good either. Both of the leaders both draw very skilled actors some of the most wood performances I have seen with some of the most uncomfortable dialogue in film history (but it can be blamed on his screenwriter Ronald Harwood, who is also odd, playing this movie who also wrote the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia. Among other things, the novel's point and themes are almost completely lost in the transition to film for the third time; There is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racist or suspicious. The music doesn't help. The painfully misplaced and annoying pastoral orchestral shelves really help with this drop of film. One upward movie is cinematography, with very nice or good shots, but unfortunately it doesn't help the movie too much. <br /> <br /> The last striking words of Alan Paton's novel are in the last moments of the film. It is too bad that they seem to be disconnected from the movie that has just been shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
