I saw many Seagal movies, and although most are not good or even good, this steaming pole has lowered the bad movie beam. <br /> <br /> The plot: not sure. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and bad guys? Hard to tell. Most of the movies are cut scenes that move back and forth between people in dark, branched rooms who complain about how good Seagals character is "Mashall". <br /> <br /> Acting: Blas. <br /> <br /> Voice Dubbing ,,,,,, What was the terrible voice overblowing? Can they find someone who sounds less like Seagal? May Cheech or Chong be doing the voice wars too. It may be entertaining at least. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely silly. Avoid it at all costs !!
