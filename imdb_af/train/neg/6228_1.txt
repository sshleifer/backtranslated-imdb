This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with several random explosions and then cuts a doll of a T-Rex talking to the audience (!). It goes back and forth between socks and animation throughout, probably because the filmmakers can't afford live actors. I will save you the long, tiring, inexorable plot that draws on a brutal 85 minutes on this spicy movie. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sold out print b-movies and bought it for the sole purpose of enjoying it, but it seems our intervention was not needed. This movie makes fun of itself better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was the cutest movie that ever existed but left it to Japanamation / Lego Cars / Sock puppets after breaking it. If you see this movie everywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and very worthwhile, very good laugh.
