Plot summary: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced with an android double, secretary agent Eric Phillips leads her off and finds a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible android murder world leaders. /> <br /> I didn't expect much when I saw the successor of Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker". That movie was nothing special, and not called a blatant rip-off of both "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with an all-out action series opening the movie. There are many explosions, heavy gunfire and a large body part, as well as some martial arts moves thanks to the movie's star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie looks like a series of action scenes that are stretched along with a minimal plot. At the stage, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
