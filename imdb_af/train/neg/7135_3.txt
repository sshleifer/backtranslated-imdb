I'm sorry to say that there is actually no way to think that an Enzo could really hold a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to weight advantage owned by the S7 will be just too big. The S7 has a force: weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hk while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The S7's low side is also much better. Sorry Ferrari fans, but the Saleen gets it just as much better. <br /> <br /> Like other parts of this movie, I just have to say it's so substandard that it's pathetic. The story is far too weak. The action in this lemon is worse than daily soap. <br /> <br /> I can say that as far as a dissertation on negative psychology is concerned, its kind of a jewel. This film is nothing if it is not a clear definition of what narcissism and sociopathy entail. It's all about this rich punks that shoot down their rocks while only showing traces of robbery to all innocent road users who also cause injury or death to them. <br /> <br /> I can't give the movie a "1 Star". rating because it didn't force me to walk out of the theater. I also think that with an incredibly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the front woman, it's being murdered to be completely uncomfortable. Although there is no point, she will be placed on the cover of 'Variety'. <br /> ps: The guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the slider version of James Vanderbeek.
