America needs the best man to win the game, so who rents them? A gymnast (O brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas has the necessary skills to win in a game involving ninjas, a village of crazies and Richard Norton, said by Kurt Thomas to his hardware in his keep pants. (His exact words) I missed it in theaters and that's a good reason, because I would probably be kicked because of the laugh I regularly broke. The first thing that went through my mind was just how lame this ninjas was when a gymnast could kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and he barely shoots like "The Best Man for Work". As for the acting talent of Kurt Thomas, good if you can't say something nice. But in all earnest, you have to wonder. how much cocaine is used to give such an idea. Just the decision to throw Tara Reid as a scientist is the stupidity here. For 18 years, however, it has the title of the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Not to say I didn't find it uncompromising, I laughed so hard that I was almost killed. Two times. Only in the 80's can a movie with such a bad idea be made. Although for the record it's the only movie ever to have a hero so wimpy, he can't even pull a grown sword out of the ground. This is the wimpiest action movie ever made, and also one of the screaming noses. <br /> <br /> * From 4- (Bad)
