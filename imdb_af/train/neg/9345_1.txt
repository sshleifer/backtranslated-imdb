I feel like I had, the franchise is on, don't fall for it. After reading glowing reviews (the director has been a film reviewer for Sky for many years, he has many friends in the press to give him a favorite by writing favorable reviews). I expected solid acting, atmosphere, excitement, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol", does not deliver the critics' promises, it offers most features in place of the cheesy low budget special effects (what was the cut spider web scene in there?), Unrealistic battle choreography and senseless sensible grief, cliché changes and camera angles. <br /> <br /> "Sixteen years of alcohol" starts interesting with some beautiful location shots in Scotland, but it is straight downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending time creating an atmosphere, creating characters that we can take care of, or building up tension, the director chooses your confidence with confidence. The main characters are so sympathetic and so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make matters worse, the homage's (typically a director's attempt to pay his grandmothers' paths) are either completely cliché or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me up and kept me in the theater, but even that didn't support the dramatic story that linked the action at other times. <br /> <br /> For some reason the movie has become increasingly flawed and frankly annoying. I still watched the whole damn thing! <br /> <br /> I think I liked the attempted eager realism in the movie, but even it was destroyed when they were often cut with strange and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. You don't need a big budget to make really moving movie, so much has been said about how little money they had to make, half a million is not a bit of money ... SO NO INVITES! Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... Or their agents think! <br /> <br /> Go over this turkey unless you are masochistic or stupid anyway .... NOT MY THINGS <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
