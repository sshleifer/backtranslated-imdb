The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the more thoughtful low budget mining films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a script that could be written this sexually sexist without the intention of self-pity. And the themes repeatedly voiced by the female head, Ginny Leith, a stand-alone head that is kept alive by machines, I-Vs and clamps, confirm that the film simultaneously uses and criticizes the enjoyment of stereotypes. Shades of underestimated Boxing Helena. <br /> <br /> Genderism is plentiful, and as annoying as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and incredible, and the acting is just OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thoughts have clearly gone into it. I'm not really sure what point the film really is trying to make, but it seems clear that it is striving for an exceptionally edgy and raw kind of horror (without expecting the blood and guts of today's audiences). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are really no heroes in this movie, and none of the characters are very similar. <br /> <br /> Both see, it's a rather painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality, from the point of view of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what a fatal car accident had to be. Her lover threatens to make a fresh, high-quality body on her and force her to continue with him. She is understandably unplowed by it all and forced to fight with a creature that is almost as monster-like as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the 1950's / 60's clich√© on the evils of science performed by Amok. <br /> <br /> Recommended for B-sci buffs and graduate students in gender studies. U / w is not recommended.
