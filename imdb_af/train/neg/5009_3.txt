It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot didn't make much sense and the acting was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a great actress, I can't imagine why she decided to do this movie. Her character, Piper, is drunk for almost the entire film, with the exception of the opening scene. On the positive side, there were several points in the film where the acting was so bad, I actually laughed aloud. But in spite of that I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is only 80 minutes long, but it is 80 minutes of your life that you will have wasted.
