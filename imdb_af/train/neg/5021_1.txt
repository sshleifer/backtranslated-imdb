This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was boring, the dialogue was horrible and the acting hammy. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it definitely played like one. It's not even very successful in its central mindset to try to appear as a single continuous take. The horoscope horizontal camera pans is an inexpensive and original way to hide cuts.
