Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of people as fuel, but there will be a power shift thanks to an apostate android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior (Kathly Long) while dealing with Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (Who plays the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions unanswered by this horrible movie, the most striking is. Whose idea was to throw country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who can give as well as he gets? . No, don't get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something, but not as a cyborg. Strange one suspects that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have the wisdom not to do so. But despite the disastrous decisions, Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. He gives a performance much more humanly than the unspeakable Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) Despite the miscasting, Kristofferson offers the few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasted, but basically Knights is baffling failure. You stand back in horror and wonder what hell thought it was even a good idea on paper. (This is a movie where a exposed Kristofferson robot fights in a backpack.) The worst of all ends up being a successor, fortunately it still has to be realized, although I still have nightmares on the prospect of the likelihood of such. an event. br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
