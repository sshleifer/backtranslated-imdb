Bah. Another tired, unfinished review of a never-filmed authorship work. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette is also super as always (an active actress, you see), and there are some beautifully handled cuts between screens. There are even a few really funny lines, and the movie, score and editing are skilled, apart from a bizarre fall in voiceover and the camera comes to the conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Many of the role players look like autopilot, and they are almost all too old (and in one case too young) for their stated ages. Worse, they all speak "Austinese", that peculiar falsetto self-satisfied song song that could not be further if people actually spoke in Austen's day (think Yosemite Sam, I don't kid you). This is particularly sad, as we finally see the death of the equally far-flung "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his brothers loved to bump over on their lungs. <br /> <br /> And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She only played one character in her films, and she stays true to this, running through her entire series for the first 10 minutes, and just repeats her for the rest of the elongated film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor a clear reason why they are interested in her apart. <br /> <br /> In short, there is very little reason to look at Emma. This is a pleasant enough adjustment, but if you are going to pack a film full of anachronisms (ie a thin lead that cannot shoot a bow or handle a period of accent), you can do it well, as with the much better "Clueless".
