Why in the world would anyone make this piece of garbage film? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were dumb enough, but it took the cake for the worst of the trilogy (maybe of all time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but no longer the scriptwriter, who is neither negative nor positive, as he is as unbeatable as the man who wrote this one. The writing is too strongly dependent on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times in nausea. The acting is about the same as the last two Bloodbath movies, so of course it's the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still seem deceptive. The plot has become too complicated for its own good, and was about a government's experiment that went wrong and produced zombies. Also featured are cryogenic frozen mutant zombie and schoolchildren who know how to travel, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I have ever seen. After the movie it goes to outtakes, which is strange because this whole movie is an issue. Just look to enjoy it, because if you go with a serious thought, you might kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 min.
