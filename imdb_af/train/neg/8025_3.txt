Yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and pupil, this performance is pretty bad. I didn't think of the first few shows, but then realized how pathetic everyone would really be at the show. The fiancé of Alex and Aaron give men a bad name in the way they chose their choice at the first opportunity was really not a good look for the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She has the most annoying voice I've ever heard on television, and she was definitely not the smartest girl (many media savvy, but I doubt there are many more). <br /> <br /> I haven't really looked at any of the shows since, except the occastional re-run on the day TV. I think the point of reality TV is to treat it as "amusing waste". Look at it as something you can laugh about, and don't think too hard. (I'm not looking at CSI, it's like TV fatigue and clichiness, but you have to think too much anyway.) <Br /> <br /> A few thoughts for some reasons to go on show. Actually, the woman tells everything. "Woman like Amy (who had a lot of class about her) said she tried to drive every scene the bar and club scene to meet a man and it didn't happen to her. Hey Amy, how about a club? Do a hobby? Do charity work? Change your work to one where you meet more guys? Spirit, all I know is going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many of the other girls were obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting "the perfect man." Tip to ladies: he doesn't exist, but there are very big guys out there who are big men some may be right for you, they may not earn six figures per year or be a JFK junior body, but they are all big, and the greed of the woman on this show is quite incredible. a youth, and has led to believe that the woman has gradually grown out of their flatness, as they become older and more realistic has about their future partner. This display proves otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how women view men in society. It's really a terrible show and I think all these kinds of apps just have to be stopped. The best dating shows at a landmill are Blind Date and the Fifth Wheel because they are fun. Nothing is more man-made than a simple evening out. The bachelor, unfortunately, takes himself too seriously.
