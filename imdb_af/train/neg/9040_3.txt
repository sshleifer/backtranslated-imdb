I agree that although this story can only be unmovable by Melville, it's not even a credible attempt. To move the story into the 20th century just violates the original story's intention and nature; Maybe you could move it in England, but it should be a time. Even our storyteller - the owner - tells it in a flashback, goes even further, around 1800. By the end of the 19th century, a strange disobedient worker would be thrown away without a thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me an explicitly deleted break !!! Even around 1800, such behaviors didn't work very well, with a view to the end. And the movie's end? I don't know what it was, because I didn't look at the whole travesty - I had to stop. It was like setting up Streetcar Named Desire in Elizabethan England.
