The script for this Columbo movie seemed to be drawn straight from a juicy 1980s soap opera. Deep-character-driven movies are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this movie was the only thing that was forced to change the channel. The villain's dialogue sounds as if it was written by a novelist. The big Lt. Columbo itself is not near its famous, sweet, self-confusing, crumpled self; and the bride / kidnapping victim is a sneaky, one-dimensional girl-in-distress (she fights in fear of a small shack held by her kidnapper flank - come on!) I could beat the scalpel out of his hand and kick him in the know in 2 seconds). In any sense of the reality, this character would at least have thought of struggling or fighting at least. And talk about reality .... the story revolves around a kidnapping that was worked and solved by the police. The police ?? Give me a chance. Everyone knows that the FBI takes over every kidnapping thing. It was NO Columbo, just a level and completely predictable crime drama with our well-known Lt. Columbo, written and stretched after 2 hours.
