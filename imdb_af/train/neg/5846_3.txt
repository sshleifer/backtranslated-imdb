Yes, it is one of those movies, so terrible, so careless, so foolish that you can't stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea good enough. The characters are so unpleasant that you are encouraged by the rats, the effects are so poor, you wonder whose base art art class was in control, the acting - oh the acting - talking about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses. <br /> But the rat, yes, the big mess. Why we didn't see the gear to the end, rather surprised me. Often, the 'big one' is not shown to the end, because the budget is limited and good effects chew so much money. However, I suspect that in this case, the big gear was hidden because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a man running around like a wooden globe with a third-world dentistry. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator. After I figured out that the rats can't sound loud (migraine from the bad act?), The chief raises a fire alarm to send the rats into a madness. If you ever want to see some rotten waltz while the blood comes out of their heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you have to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, OK?
