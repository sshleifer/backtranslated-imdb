Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautiful movie, there is no doubt about it. And the acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as it is written. <br /> <br /> But so many details small and big are just _wrong_ that it's just too much trouble to be able to fully enjoy it. A small detail that characterizes the kind of lack of sensitivity of types is one scene (no it wastes) where Mameha is ringing a bell hanging at the door of the house where Sayuri lives on a snowy day. The bell she calls is a fireblock or wind bell - it is only staying outside of homes in Japan in summer! People in traditional Japanese homes didn't have doorbells - they opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think it is such a trivial detail, but I will compare it to a movie made about America where a Christmas wreath hangs in the door in July and no one thinks of it.) And doesn't even get me at all wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha, which are vaguely pan-asian / chinese / kung-fu, and nothing like the right thing. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray is really reflected in the attitudes and portrayals of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So I guess the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (what is Miyako), then I think the more you will enjoy it. I honestly think this movie could have been so much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
