(it may be a bit on the evil side). I would like to start by saying that I didn't watch the whole movie, and I couldn't either because it was clear from the first hour that I would be incredibly disappointed. This is, of course, the problem to take, which many believe to be a wonderful book, and to make it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time had to be made in a wonderful movie long ago. It has a great story that children and adults can attach. Plus it's built in quality sequel. But Disney fying wasn't the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to make it into a visual story plunged so well into the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace pure "psychic" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to fight between the three. Wants to write as extra stress, there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses. This deprived us of what could be a very lovely scene between Calvin and Meg happening in the book. <br /> <br /> I can talk about small things for days. , but I also think bigger things, like the art scene was down. Take, for example, the way they made Camazotz look, with its strange darkened air. The creepiness that comes in the book is that Camazotz can be the Earth. It looks like the earth. It has people who look like people. The clouds are blue, the grass is green and children play. But something is a little off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson, of course, is that Camazotz can be very good at Earth, that's when we forget how to love. It would have been much nicer to have a beautiful afternoon, as they walk down the street while the kids are bumping the balls into the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I didn't look the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney got the end too. <br /> <br /> Generally an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
