**** Don't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a total surprise. <br /> <br /> A clay plesiosaur rises from the depths of the crater lake to cause havoc on a group of local rednecks, not to mention your quick button. Calling 'The Crater Lake Monster' is amateur to overdo the obvious. If you're not a fan of low budget-in-movies, you probably won't look here in the first place. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is if there is no sample action, it really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, in that it is completely set up in the way it sets up the main action sequences. Nothing is too unusual for "The Crater Lake Monster". This explains his dinosaur by having a meteor crash in Crater Lake, which dominates the water to a point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that is believed to lie among the lake for thousands of years. Even if we could assume that the egg had been lying there for so long and would be viable, would the water not be overheated to such a high temperature that most of the lake would evaporate? Unlike a token dung in one or two scenes, we see no evidence that the water is hot, except for a few lines in writing. <br /> <br /> The writing is posted quite clearly in a few rows, and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so they can be threatened by the clay dino. A couple just passing by motor vehicles and while servicing their car, they decide to rent a boat and go to Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think these aliens in the story can be there so they can run in our title monstrosity? In a bizarre series, a liquor store robs a drunk and decides to kill the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of spit. A car hunt is coming, and you won't know ... they end right next to the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yes, it's not hard to figure out, and you're so far ahead of the writing that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes to unfold these scenes. <br /> <br /> The shamelessness of it all is engaging, and I would like to keep "The Crater Lake Monster". I just can't do it. There is not enough here to continue, and it is more of a movie used during a party because you can talk right about it and it won't matter. <br /> <br /> The movie has a scant list of things to do. The most important thing is the dinosaur itself, which is in three forms: a shady puppet, a large model head that is dragged through the water, and a fully realized clay work insert that looks really good. There are also some lovely hicks in it, and they carry the majority of intentional humor in the movie. An indifferent end lets us kill both the monster and one of our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this movie is dead at the end. Why am I so affected by this conclusion? Was this the sad song played over the closing credits? Or was I just crying inside for the time being, so much like movies thriving?
