DR. SEUSS HOW THE GRIN STEEL KERS / / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable will continue, see "Dr. Seuss" How the Grinch Stole Christmas. " If you're old enough to read this review, you're probably too old to get some kind of pleasure from this movie. It features lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyful sounds, and characters resemble the real inhabitants of the fictional town of Whoville. Unfortunately, this is where the film's positive elements end; The rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to tap the screen while giving a devilish smile, while having nothing to do with the exaggerated wide-screen script. Many people recognize the story. of how the grinch Christmas stole from Whoville, so I won't waste my time writing a complete synopsis to read. However, I will say that the film's story is performed in three great deeds; the development of the grinch and the institution, the Whoville festival and the dr. Seuss vision of the average one who robbed Who of their Cherry. There are many well-known names in the credits here, but no familiar faces. As in the "Battlefield Earth", I just don't see why producers will hire expensive actors, just to protect their identities from unrecognizable make-up and costumes. Regardless, there is SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, later Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins gives his whisper to the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is Grinch's lost lover. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on little Cindy Lou. The script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels that it is all over the film landscape. There is little or any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too bulky and confronted. The only character that is distinguished here is the Grinch itself, all the other characters are dolls of the plot, formless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is overwhelming and too wheat to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity! <br /> <br /> The film's redeeming factors go out to gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, costume designer Rita Ryack, and the spacious makeup department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good production. The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; It is like a audience visiting a world like in a dream. Whoville people are plastered with makeup, to the point where we can't tell the actor what the humorous lines are. Though brilliant, I really can't give credit to the performances, because they are looking at the result of the expensive technical department taking their place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is one actor I can talk about. His performance is what almost destroyed the film itself. He is too selfish as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to recognize the story everywhere as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, though, there are a few funny moments due to some cleverly clever rows, no laughs come from Jim Carry's patience. It's almost like the movie was specifically written for Carry to persuade his part. This factor only leads the movie to a wild but mindless comedy, which is just a light shadow of the original Christmas classic "How to Grinch Stolen Christmas." <br /> <br /> After this movie, historians need the coffin of The late author, dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave. <br /> <br />
