I can't believe NO of the official reviews for this movie warns that it contains two rather alarming sexual assault statements. It is as if our culture accepts this kind of behavior rather than just sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that these attacks do not seem to be condemned - as in the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured, the men never hold accountable for their actions, nor anybody else. One man is stopped to complete the assault when someone throws a dagger on him, but he is only reprimanded with "you cannot force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually" not ... "a woman's point of view, the movie is a down-down. It makes women 'throw' a little, so they can be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the film is much more defined by the romance - characterized by the idea that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men who dominate the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to repel her attackers. She doesn't even apologize for them - rather it seems excusable. Overall, a depressing and disturbing movie, with some great cinematography and some cool scenes, but not as good as a hero by a long shot.
