This film was basically Velvet Goldmine when the writers of a party of five got it and it was, Movie. The film did not have what Velvet Goldmine had, and it was good acting, written and basically everything else. The movie has some of the worst writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It should definitely be interesting. I know VH 1 has become a household name for them behind the music program. which is much better than all that would have worked out if it was behind the music section, but didn't knock it down.
