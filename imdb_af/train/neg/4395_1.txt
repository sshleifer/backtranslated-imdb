December holiday special offers, such as the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy but light-hearted story. They must have a touch of the mystical magic of the holiday. Basically they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special" and they should have a decent and appropriate December holiday subtext. <br /> <br /> So when I saw Legend of Frosty, the snowman in the TV lists, I pumped my kids (6 and 8) to tell it by telling them the story of the original Frosty and with passion related to how much I enjoyed it as a child. As my wife and children sat on the couch to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but ten minutes later my kids grew and my wife and I gave each other 'the look' and made our eyes roll. After 35 minutes my kids actually asked to go to bed. I thought they were tired of the insensitive language and useless, disconnected segments. I was actually embarrassed by their (and my) disappointment with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Quite Strange Parents crossed with a worse than normal episode of Sponge Bob as a classic holiday movie. Don't get me wrong. These shows are good and I love them as much as the next guy, but when I look at Fairly Fair Parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, down-color, zero subtext, intelligence false episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We took out good books and spent the rest of the evening. A much better choice than the embarrassing bad legend of Frosty the Snowman.
