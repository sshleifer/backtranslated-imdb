I was not very impressed with Dante's 1st season offer in "Homecoming", it wasn't much of a horror story, but rather a clever political statement with the undead. Screw plane situation is the story of a virus that is triggered on the world, causing men's sexual drives to be replaced with murderous tendencies towards women. The episode begins well with a short film explaining the way in which the screw fly was killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man is arrested when female bodies are discovered in his home. I think it's supposed to show the start of the outbreak, but it's unclear because it's never repeated. The episode will be introducing us for a while characters blah blah blah.It looks cool and mysterious, but the episode stars worse and worse as it lurches forward to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
