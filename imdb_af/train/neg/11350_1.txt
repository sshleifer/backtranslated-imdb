As long as there is 3d technology, (1950s I think) there is animation made for it. I specifically remember a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it. I don't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus, fed an elephant peanut and Chip and Dale stole the peanuts. It's made to look in 3d in the 1960s. If you happened to look with the Robinsons in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin. There are probably about 100 cartoons made specifically to be watched by 3d glasses. This claim was a bad move because it was not difficult to prove them wrong. In addition, it looks just like a bad movie.
