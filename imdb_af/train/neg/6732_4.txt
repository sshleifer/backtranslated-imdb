I discovered this movie at IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For "little" love stories, some of the stories really dragged on in this movie. The fact that none of these women have had any names suggests that the actresses talk about their own real sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit I want to see another romantic view of the first sexual encounters, like in Strike! (1998). When Odette began to ask Sinclair's acquaintances about her supposed first time, Tweety asked, "Was it beautiful?" <br /> <br /> Some people may think re-enactments and flashbacks will improve this movie. I think it will make things even worse. It doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
