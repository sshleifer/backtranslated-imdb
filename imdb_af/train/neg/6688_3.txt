This movie is pretty awful, but I have interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at North Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good bulk of the extras in the movie are then drama students of the NAU. That year I was a first year in the theater, but for some reason I didn't get involved in the production. However, I knew several people who could and could do this strange fact: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this movie where two of the principals, as part of their emerging ritual, have to walk naked in the forest. They are seen from behind in the movie, just like that. The thing is, it's not the actors, but two guys I knew about the theater section. The identity of these "stunt posteriors" remains anonymous, at least on this site, unless they decide to reveal "themselves"!
