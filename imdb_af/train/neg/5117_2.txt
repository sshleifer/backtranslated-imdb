I would first like to declare that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry) so that I understand how it works on a feature-length movie so that the filmmakers work in that respect . I am all for positive, uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (it is a fallen world and that things do not always work out ... even for Christ's followers). I am glad that others have such overwhelmingly positive responses to the open Christian message; to me it was just that the performance was where the film fell on his face. A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes, largely outline and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably the least. I believe a movie doesn't have to cling to you with its message to get the point over. I'm probably the Kendrick brittle. will improve over time and their storytelling methods will also go. Maybe they can manage someone else's script as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Dreams, etc.) can inspire in all sorts of ways. If you're interested in a PG-rated movie that inspires, Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill' gives a glance. The truth is God's truth ...
