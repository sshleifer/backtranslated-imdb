Before I saw this movie, I expected a fictitious drama based loosely on ideas from the book; Instead, it is the book interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the various "diseases". It didn't bother me much, but it hampered my enjoyment of the movie. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book that was cut by the movie would have been preferable to me. If you are going to base a movie on a psychology text, you should find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film is about parts where it is not much more than a video encyclopedia of sexual psychology of the 19th century and it would be totally unbearable if it was not sexual in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, there are several stories with real character development that we involve. <br /> <br /> But disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's sexuality theories mostly ran unchallenged. I was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology that are still held by humans to this day. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of some fetishes and orientations, with some very interesting stories that have healed the trials and tribulations of some "sexual abusers" before they. For most of the movie, the movie moves with the creep speed (and mood) of a wake-up call. And as a clear low budget movie, cinematography and acting aren't exactly top notch. Although * I was happy with the music, costume and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt this movie's subject was right on me, and I still feel it's a below average movie. It earns a 3/10; a 4/10 if I feel very generous. I can't imagine anyone enjoying it if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism.
