This DVD seems to be shown on someone who just wants to adjust it and play in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos from the Grand Canyon that have been featured on various types of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is sowing and the transfer to DVD looks rather vague and dull. Too expensive a DVD for what it is.
