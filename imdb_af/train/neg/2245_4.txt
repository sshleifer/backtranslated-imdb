This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and it is a pity that the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I do not deny Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore I can't judge it. However, this film leaves much to be desired. It is slowly muted, it has free neck and dirty language and can be very difficult to go through. <br /> <br /> But I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's just natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 movie with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.
