It's a bad, poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well, one can appreciate some creativity, but not creativity. The acting of all is affected and the whole movie is a disgrace. Shekar's father's choice of words in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and self-explanatory and destroys the spirit of the original story. Once again, the scene where Shekhar (Saif) Lolita slaps away with the movie and the characters' flow is quite annoying for the senses and could easily be avoided. Likewise, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is unaware of the movie and a cheap gimp to attract the audience. When a creative work is not true to the original and destroys its spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is pretty good. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and earns credit. On these scores, this movie earns 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks artifice and it's a switch. The song is noisy, but I remember hearing it somewhere before and if it wasn't wrong, it looked like the melody was plagued. <br /> <br /> Agreed that the times have changed since then. But then this movie is not even a reflection of modern times. <br /> <br /> That's what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly obsessed with impressing NRAs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such movies do not end up in India or any other part of the world.
