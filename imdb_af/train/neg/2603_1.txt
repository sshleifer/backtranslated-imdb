I was interested in the subject, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dance on the David Letterman desk will find all the distance that is interesting. Okay, she shows breast (or maybe a body double). The plot is cut and the play is terrible. No lead has any material to work with, as the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. Don't waste your time. See Donnie Darko rather if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore movie, and if you want to see another, skip it and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is also absolutely criminal. Refer to Charles Williams' "Descent Into Hell" novel for something worth considering. It's just an excuse to make a B-movie to go straight to the video and suck a life out of people at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes any of these people think that the acting here was commendable? Give me a chance.
