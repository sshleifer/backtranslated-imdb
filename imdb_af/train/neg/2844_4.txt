This is one of the worst films Clark Clark made. Of course, only PARNELL was worse. It's just as painfully clicked and the dialogue is so thought it was not something, or Gable or Jean Harlow had to be proud to make. <br /> <br /> Gable is a heel whose illegal activities cause his girl to go The slumber (as the gunman speaks?). She hopes he'll do the right thing, but he just leaves her there - unknown to one of them, that she's on the family road. Ultimately, the villain returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie it all together into a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten that Gable had to take the rap and spend a couple of years in the loft. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are at their best here". By what standard? Best to produce unintended chuckles? Gimme a break! <br /> <br /> PS - after saying this, my wife Leonard Maltin thinks I'm going to get me and kick my butt. Hmmm. However, despite my comments, I think Mr. Maltin is the best judge and person on the planet. (I hope it encouraged him). <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/2/08. Because I didn't like this movie for the first time (especially the ridiculous end), I decided to watch it again. Sometimes when I watch another movie, I find it much more and realize I was a bit too hard. Although it has been with several films over the past few months, I still disapproved of the film - even the second time. Most of it wasn't because of the first half of the movie. In the first half, Harlow's character was incredibly stupid, but at least it was credible. But when she was sent to prison, it was all the clich√©s until the last ridiculous marriage world took place. The bottom line is that this series is embarrassingly dumb - it just makes no sense and is related to making the movie into a little fairy tale story rather than a love story about two disadvantages. I stand by my original review (despite all the "NOT HELPFUL") and think that, except PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, it might just be the worst Gable movie.
