I got a copy of the author of this movie on soulseek. I have to say it's pathetic and just painful to see the two policemen, but I saw the movie as a joke and since it is a tribute to August's underground I saw, it's in my book as a wonderful movie. The quality and everything about it is pretty bad, but it's entertaining and something to talk about your friends. Remind me of Troma, but good things. I recommend seeing it under two conditions, if you're bored and having a good laugh, or high, otherwise you should just leave it. Recommended download for sure. o and the murders are pretty funny. As when the zombie rips, Satan throws down worshipers and puts someone in the head.
