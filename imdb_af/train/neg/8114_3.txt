... mainly because Ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous forty-minute material that was literally taken straight from the first Ju-on - and if you think the sequel lasts only 76 minutes, leave you with 36 original minutes' value of film. Ho-hum. I found it very annoying - as if viewers simply didn't remember the same things! OK, the complaint aside, the Ju-on 2 extension was that it left many of the unanswered questions of the first movie, which honestly, more than 36 minutes, simply go far enough to make any sense of the original's highly complicated story. don't make it. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some very nice new horror series that show how good the movie might have been if it had time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original, some, but not all, are answered. <br /> <br /> Finally - if you love the first original movie and want to see further developments about the story, go for it - just remember to keep your remote with your finger on the fortune button for forty minutes.
