"It could mean the end of the white race!" Throw a General as a Dozen Native Zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the "Great War". An expedition stretches from the long-lost, back-projected town of Kennif-Angor to stop these kinds of things and clear the battlefields for decent, honest white people to kill the tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It's a little difficult to tell when people are zombies or not in this movie, as the play is so wood. Even by 1936 standards the play in this movie is bad. From a previous decade. It seems that it came from a correspondence school textbook on "How to do" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions ------- ------ <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and aversion (Female). Bend both fists. Put one hand at heart. Open mouth to scream. Put other fists, palm out, against mouth, hold for 10 seconds longer than comfortable, then quickly turn 90 degrees away from the direction of a worn object and sob. "<br /> <br />" How difficult, emotionally charged scene with old fianc√© Explain your love for someone else, do not make eye contact, do not move, do not show any emotion, do not move your eyes too much when reading your lines from the studio. "<br /> <br /> To give us a break that the director of the director is doing at night in long breaks, where nothing happens, except that the film runs through the projectors. So 35 minutes of story is knocked out to 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The uprising of the zombies when it comes is so slow! From the spiritual slavery, the armies of ex-zombie-minions are turned on their former master by slowly climbing the hill and then piercing and hitting a window. "Yes ... let's ... oh, I don't know yes. Let's get him grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (Although I only found a piece of hidden symbolism, Jagger was shot by a native as a kind of ironic counterpart to all the Natives shot by the Germans at the beginning of the movie. end of the white race!) The chase (you can call it) through the backyard swamp is hilarious and the entry price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a lot of time to camp it, but is completely wasted, like Kol. Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting moment in this movie. A beautiful little montage of the zombie natives and white-stunned members who fall under the evil eye-watch. face to face, cross-paint in each other. It works, even if a strange blip is cut in the middle of each neighbor like a frame. I think it should be Neg Cutters' frames between the blur. <br /> <br /> Best watched with friends and in a silly mood.
