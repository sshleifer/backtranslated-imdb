What do they think about "Cannes"? One of the most annoying movies of all time. Every detail of this movie, no matter how meaningless. If I had to see her, I would once again put on those boots, I think I would have shouted. If the point of this movie was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had, then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the credits had to be executed. But no, we had to see many excess scenes over and over. The whole thing was filled with impatient and impersonal characters. They deserve the misery that Rosetta was. And to think, I passed "Tumbleweeds" to see this overheated movie of boredom. It was as if the grass was growing, but it was more exciting.
