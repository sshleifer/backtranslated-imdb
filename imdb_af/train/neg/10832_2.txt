Normally, I don't have a problem with a free cry in movies, but this one really irritated me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And as someone else noticed, get cancer). It was boring, rattling and pretentious. I wouldn't if I were you. <br /> <br /> It's also not that I don't like movies, as most people who like it will demand life to observe. I love Eating Drink Man Wife, and all that happens is that a burden of Taiwanese people leads their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who swore as much as the "actors" in this movie, and I worked on a construction site. So go figure. It said that William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy tedium.
