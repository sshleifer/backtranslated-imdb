Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who seems to be trying his hand. "A Walk on the Moon" seems to have been borrowed from other, better-made films. The current story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for workers Jews, not far from Woodstock. The screen treatment by Pamela Gray is not much for it, so it is a mystery why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this movie as his first attempt in the direction. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends time at the resort. We see them coming to the little house that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, only comes for the weekend; He works in what seems to be a family small device business recovery television set, mostly. In a few days the first man will walk into space, so the excitement is clear. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz women are left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend idle days in place until the bloody seller arrived. Pearl goes up and she finds much more than a shmatte; she also gets the salesman. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sexual life at all. After two children, Pearl, apparently sexy and high-libido, is ready for some extra wedding ceremony. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for the film, which becomes a soap opera when young daughter, Alison, decides to play brackets and goes to the Woodstock festival, where, horror of horrors, she testifies that her own mother comes out with the bloody seller! What is a girl to do? Well, stay at the highlight of the big finale when all the parties are fortunate to be reunited by the little one's bed when placed by wasps and the salesman comes to apply a home pollution, and Dad is called from the city after he knew came from Pearl's betrayal with the younger stud. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she later made "Unreliable", which is the upscale version of this dud. Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters for his lonely female customers, whispering little things in their ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the cake-run man, didn't have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh are the unfortunate Nana, who has stayed in the city to watch her soap operas instead of seeing firsthand playing in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> Watch It is at your risk, or the DVD in the telly pop when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want a laugh or two to entertain the movie.
