Because this is all she does through this whole movie, naked without good reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, she suddenly removes her clothes. Since when has a boa-displacer been toxic? How did Tarzan get forgiveness? This whole movie is screwed. They can't do the species of animals for this movie. What is an orangutan hanging around the chimpanzees? He had to wander off the set of a much better movie. The group of cannibal stem men looks like Caucasus. Why? And why was Bo and her father painted, if they were going to eat later? It was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again. Her father, while hunting, approaching and acting dumbly around an elephant while standing too close to it. A true African elephant that wasn't off the circus would have knocked this bum out of the morning. Any smart hunter would have seen the moment he saw. And I can't help but wonder if the camera was on LSD, as it showed several scenes that were slowly going on for no good reason. It didn't heal at all. The boa displacer that Tarzan wrestles in the water looks like one of those 12 Ft rubber snakes you can buy at a local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan was strangly sp I am sorry in this movie. Perhaps it is from Bo that she flashes so much. I'm sorry, but it's a deterrent to a classic black and white Tarzan movie with a similar but better story. Not to speak. There is one scene in that I saw that everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * The scene where he tries to save Jane and her dad is too close to a running water spray. He seemed to urinate on someone under him. Eww! He and Jane also walk around on a beach, with perforated monkeys jumping and banging. She probably did her father's death really well. * (END OF SPOILERS) * There must be a surgeon general's warning on this movie. see Bo too naked in this movie, make you blind.
