I see myself as a bit snobbish as far as all this is concerned, and although the movie experience is more suited to explosions than a high drama, I can be very stuck about movies. <br /> <br /> Not all, however, art films are better than King Kong. I will probably give two stars of Kong, double this movie. <br /> <br /> My guess is that people got so excited about it because it was almost identical in style to what you could see in a play. For the less distinctive art buff, a movie that looks like a play is 'great art'. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was useless. <br /> <br /> There was hardly a story so it relied on high drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would drop the roof or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great play? Rare. <br /> <br /> To be excessively fair: Some of the scenery was interesting, though: Communist apartments, city seats (Petersburg?) and the Soviet trams still in service.
