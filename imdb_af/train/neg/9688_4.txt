Greenaway's films form clever, erudite and innovative. Yet his style and grammar remind and remind the viewers of movies made in the First World War. The frame composition, the use of the middle shoe, the static camera. It might be good to rub against mainstream movies with this style, but it's not new. Perhaps like this other "innovator", TS Eliot, he would pull more of the past than he could or could look like an authentic innovator. <br /> <br /> But Greenaway's biggest failure is that he can't write. His dialogue and even plot structure are mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this worst is clearest is in his humor, ready and logical, so the joke is dead before it is delivered. The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it fails: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the well-educated director can learn something from Freud on humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. They speak the lines with a bored, airplane like narcissistic adolescents. <br /> <br /> Despite its design and lighting, this film is meretrial.
