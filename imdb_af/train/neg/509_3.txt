This film is about British war prisoners from World War II escaping from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find "The Wooden Horse" disappointingly boring. The subject was exciting, exciting and adrenaline fueled, but "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and narrated events, without suspension and excitement. The first half clearly tells how the prisoners of war have dug a tunnel, but the events are so clear, with not enough blunders and narrow shears to bring me to the brink. The latter half of the movie is even worse, they just move from one place to another without any cat and mouse hunt. And the characters can talk a little less and have more action in an action movie! I'm disappointed by "The Wooden Horse", it has the potential to be a good movie, wasted.
