Now I've seen very bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and enjoy) all the films by Jean-Claude Van Damme, including the one where he is his own clone, both of whom he plays twins and all three where he is a cyborg. I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a battle in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he has a good hole and you almost always see it. With DVD you can even break and zoom!) That's why you can trust me if I say this movie is so bad making Plan 9 like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The writing is bad. The sets are bad. The battles are bad. The stunts are bad. The FX is bad. The play is spectacular, earth-breaking, which is probably the worst performance of every so-called actor in the film, including Lorenzo Lamas, and it really says something. And I want to be willing to bet everyone involved in this movie is in bed, to get started. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It's inadvertently funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a native idiot or very, very stoned. I could penetrate it myself because I needed something to guide me to flush my urine. <br /> <br /> It didn't help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillo's cameo as a gay arson.
