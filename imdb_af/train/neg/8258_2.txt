I was lucky to read the book before I saw the movie. It was an epic of adolescence, a dream of summer away, a great potential indie movie or big budget drama. It somehow got in the hands of a heel, which clearly took notes to watch Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The writing loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low appearance throws. I feel sorry for the actors, as the characters in the book were rich and structured, but cut into embarrassment in the film. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, like Dylan Baker, but the skeleton left over from the story plays like a bad after school special. Poor people = GOOD, Rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it is almost worth looking at the Southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his trailer, which is meant to pass a Delaware bay. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassment for director Mills Goodloe for the first time. <br /> <br /> K.
