Cracking the weird good joke, the humor is generally pretty dry, with panel members often pulling faces or using heavy language and waiting for the crowd to complain. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what another comment says I don't think it's the best RTE ever made, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of white, there are few really funny intelligent gags that will really make you laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by the comedians well-known names rather than judging the quality of the gags that aren't really that good. Overall its mediocre with some good laughs, but often it can be pretty mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff. I find Benny Hill snapper.
