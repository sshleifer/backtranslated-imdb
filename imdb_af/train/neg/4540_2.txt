Initially, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - it demonstrates the problems of true interpretation of esoteric issues. I loved the book and was totally disappointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, with half a heart and the story was badly explained. The novel - in the first place! - was not meant to focus on an adventure! It's just the environment. In the movie, the focus just reverses and this and the message has a back seat! Additionally, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and to show the end of the events were parsimonious! They screwed it! ... I will never see it again!
