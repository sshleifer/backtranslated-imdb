Thanks to this movie, I can now answer the question, "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can't even think of a close second, and I've really seen bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this movie. Name a single element of any horror movie and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here's a typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, are you?" "Steve, I'm not joking." "Steve, it's not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "Arggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
