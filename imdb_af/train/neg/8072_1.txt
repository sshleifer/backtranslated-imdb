(A possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" are probably the worst movie ever released. Nothing makes sense, there's a plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who might be dead or not. The whole movie is just a bunch of casual shots of things that don't really bond to each other at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Tha play doesn't exist, the work of the camera is jerky and the writing is so confusing. This makes the movie even harder to watch. <br /> <br /> I was still waiting to tie the movie together, but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
