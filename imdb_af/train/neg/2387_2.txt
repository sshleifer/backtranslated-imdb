I couldn't believe how lame and useless it was. Actually, there is nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scenes around you in the rest of the movie. This movie moved in a few big stars, but they were all messed up. I think Keanu Reeves should take a few scenes a few years after this movie before staring at The Matrix. Uma Thurman looks very simple and humble. Luckily I got this movie for a very low price because it is definitely not a movie to remember for good reason. I will write nothing about the story of the movie, but if you have to know she is the best known hitchhiker in America because of her big thumb. I'll give this movie a 2/10. Before I watched this movie, I wondered why this movie only got a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Don't buy it, even if you see it for less than $ 5.
