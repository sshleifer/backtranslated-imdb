Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team as basketball players hustlers. Well, that sounds good there. It leaves plenty of room for good comedy and a good story. But such an event did not take place in the many next boring minutes of this pathetic film movie. This film became obsolete, delayed and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had passed. Woody Harrelson has one of my favorite tsv. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I look forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "theater show", I came to the conclusion that he still has to play stupid game. His acting was as dull and poor as the movie. Another actor in this unreal movie was Rosie Peres. I used to play movies with Perez, but I decided that I had the reason I enjoyed other works in her career, that she wasn't a main character and didn't have so many talk lines (Do the right thing) . But now in White Men can not jump, she is a central character with many lines made, which means the audience has to stick out her incredibly annoying and shiny voice. So after I saw this movie (term used) and Rosie Peres appreciated much more, I can now say I'm a white man and I'm ready to jump. . . of a twenty-story apartment building.
