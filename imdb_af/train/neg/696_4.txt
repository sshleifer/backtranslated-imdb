Uh, not a particularly good blower. So-acting, effects, decent but familiar and unbeatable soundtrack. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths in close succession, near the start of the movie, creating a pretty good scene in which everything looks. In addition, there are many characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or chasing red herring; more murder on time than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity killer, not partial to anyone. The killer also likes to appoint other people to kill innocent people as well. The identity is not revealed at the end, and the motive is pretty thin and we really don't care. <br /> <br /> Presumably the movie is Christmas, but it's not a major factor. One scene is lit by Christmas lights, it's about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the videotape I watched. Some of the dialogue got a little lost in some of the opening styles. The end had to be stronger than it was. We think we realize what happened, although there is a chance that something else has done.
