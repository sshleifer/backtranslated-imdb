God, I'm so sick of the shit coming from America, called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Since becoming anime, US animators also make a cartoon with a 5-year-old lazy ass. drawing (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese animated rip-offs. (Usually spilling classic characters) No wonder anime hitting American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They're no longer trying! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard of this night; I live in the UK and when I found out, this exhibition only came out in 2005. Well, I never knew the UK was so familiar with current performances.
