[I saw this movie late on a public TV station, so I don't know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesque" (sic) which Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s. It is hard to believe that anyone will leave their daughter in this brave movie, which today can only be seen as "kiddie porn". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple stars in a role that is probably an average age of 5. They are all in diapers, and are in a salon that serves milk instead of alcohol. The "cash" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "femme fatale" sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers commenting on her (!). But Shirley doesn't really need their lollipops / cash, because her purse is full of other men's. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a little black boy has a suggestive dance at a nearby table. <br /> What a strange movie. . . Babies using racy dialogue play adult roles in a salon. Who thought these things in any way?
