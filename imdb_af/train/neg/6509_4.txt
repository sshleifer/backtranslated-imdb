Sean Bean is great, just like photography, places and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat astonished, and the conclusion flat. The plot has changed substantially from Cornwell's novel, not to the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. Sharpe was drawn too closely now, unlike his literary alter ego, which looks more intelligent and, despite his fear in his new role, is determined as an officer promoted by the ranks. I really enjoyed the short scene in which Sharpe was attacked by a "real" officer, and after a quick break and piercer, the surprised and stunned officer pushed back. This sets the tone for his later trials as a commander. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" of "10."
