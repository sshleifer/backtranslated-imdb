During a sleepless night I switched through the channels and found this embarrassment for a movie. What do they think? <br /> <br /> If it's life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder she's gone nowhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take it? role? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But it should have been the best part. This nerdy college child brings this dominatrix-ish girl home ... this scene is straight from the comic books - or the cheap porn movies. She called the mother anal retention and kissed the father "Oh, I didn't expect the tongue!" Big lines! <br /> <br /> Then I had to see how it ended. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this bitch of hell has passed half, so the SWAT team is up. And yes ... they surround her! And yes yes! The child blows her brain out !!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> It's a must-watch TV. <br /> <br />
