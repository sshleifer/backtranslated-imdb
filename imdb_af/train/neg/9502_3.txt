This movie was bizarre, totally inexplicable, and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house. I'm really fond of starting things with Lisa wandering about lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger who is lost in some exotic European places, although maybe not in a low budget horror flick. Definitely the end where the weird non-sexual sex scenes are cut out anyway (in my DVD copy). Don't try to understand it, just go along and look out for the strange bits ... what's all. Don't look at it if you actually want plot or characterization, or to do something. Beautiful, though you might just give up and decide to watch a real horror movie, for example, Dead Alive.
