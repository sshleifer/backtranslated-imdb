Indifferently stupid, non-budget "war image" has been made to portray the features of the spectacular Eve Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but it must be an embarrassment to all who are related to it. Laughable "script", performances that will not succeed in a primary school Christmas exhibition, unobtrusive "action" scenes, confusion by normally-competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - which apparently is not quite sure if he is making a comedy , a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a learning T & A (in the early 1960s standards, anyway) travel report of Eve Meyer's wonderful body - and a general air of clumsiness and incompetence. Worth to see, to see Eve Meyer, she sat down well, but it really is.
