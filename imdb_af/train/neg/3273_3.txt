The Dukes of Hazzard is quite an achievement ?? A $ 53m movie that is worse than any given episode of a 25-year-old TV show. The plot is adequate, but the ceaseless pleasure is seldom to be found and the casting is very horrible: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a mere crook, Michael Weston's Enos tiring, a seemingly ideal-cast Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for the check, and Burt Reynolds stuck in a purgatory where he is doomed to his old movies to revive as a little player. , is a strange choice for Boss Hogg to say the least, but has a good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. You know a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen conditions ?? But worse than the screenplay or the casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: apparently born with no concept of comic timing, can't do much more than basic two shots and let alone clueless about how to shoot a car hunt The few decent stunts in the film, he seems determined to juice the film of any signs of life before they materialize. There are a few neat postmodern moments that revolve around the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in each episode, but no movie that shines for the days when Hal Needham could do this kind of thing (and badly) can be good thing. thing.
