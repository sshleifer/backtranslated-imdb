I saw and jumped this movie a few days ago during the scary parts. I must admit, I found it pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters were saying. Logical Problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a nice fit, makes no noise while being killed. Don't you think he at least tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When commenting that the gym teacher "SOOOO is in love with Lisa," I almost screamed on the screen. When your best friend's family killed by a teacher who was in love with her, you don't comment if you have half your heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many ears they have in the house and catches the uncle, there might be danger, it would not be the smartest thing to do to Donna, boyfriend, aunt and uncle in a get a car and drive far, far away, then lure the house with the HRT and the police force so the killer can't get out <br /> <br /> I can keep going. And so on. And so on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters weren't profiled enough so you could actually feel empathy when they were slaughtered and there were far too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> BUT. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night. If you don't consider all the goofs, it's a mediocre movie.
