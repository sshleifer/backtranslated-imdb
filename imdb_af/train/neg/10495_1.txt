I think the Croc Hunter is a nice old man! I know I won't have the nerve to go off even 5 feet from a hook. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Making jokes, eating people and the shit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie to stay away from. All the "jokes" are so youthful that you will laugh yourself because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the Croc Hunter didn't ask the crocodile to eat it after seeing it.
