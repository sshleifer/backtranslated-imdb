"Lies" talks about a relationship between an 18-year-old young woman and a young, 38-year-old married man with the few protocols doing about half the screen time with bare sex and hokey, and the other half winding through the pathetic naive story that seems little more than an excuse for sex scenes. With a very poor production value, including obvious sanitary appliances and rude soft-head sex, after a story that is a messy mix of comedy and drama, Lies becomes superfluous. With almost 2 hours of running, subtitles and so little dust, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (C-)
