... and how they carry you out of your mind! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies of the 70's, made with no actors of any note, an embarrassment, turbulent direction, and an untiring desire to collect "horror" with light comedy. This movie introduces a palaeontologist who signs an aquatic dinosaur under the Crater Lake. A meteorite falls from the sky and an aquatic dinosaur of the clay species begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants around Crater Lake. The whole thing is cared for by Steve, our local sheriff. Many of the movies - when no blood bottles are shown of what we imagined, had to be cattle cattle - are released following the bumbling antiques of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental. They try so funny to be funny, that we get songs, and look at a business sign, Mitch says to Arnie: "You spelled bait wrong, it's spelled B-A-T-E." The laugh was scarce here. We then see that they get drunk and think a tree stump to be the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy watch out! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun. And at the very least, the more beautiful.
