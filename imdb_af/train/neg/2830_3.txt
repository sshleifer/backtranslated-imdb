If Ashanti was a serious attempt at a movie about the establishment of slavery, which still occurs in third world countries, the film could be better received. Instead, it became a star-burdened disaster of a movie where stars came in, voiced their lines and picked up their salaries without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife, Beverly Johnson, work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are doing their humanitarian affairs in East Africa. In addition, Peter Ustinov comes to scarcely call him the role of a Muslim slave trader. As Johnson is black, he still grabs her with many children and also some adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine doesn't like the kidnapping and the rest of the movie is going to be a rescue effort. The rest of the movie features people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in parts and looks so incredibly bored with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Usually in something like these talented people. Like those mentioned above, it will only be outrageous and celebrating on a beauty diet. But Ashanti doesn't even do it. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax writing is aerated through the air.
