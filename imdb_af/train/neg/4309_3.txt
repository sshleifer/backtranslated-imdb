A high school principal (Keenan Wynn) with a lost basketball team unknowingly hires a coach who is not just a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for their new way of winning. Are you really surprised? Along the way, a romance grows between the coach and the team's star player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never notified. <br /> <br /> Packed with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie, this movie doesn't really make a service. It can easily be adjusted in a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks good as coach Randy Rawlings, especially in her skimpy outfits, but I expected more than mere titillation from an R-rated movie. A side plot that a dorky center hypnotized by his teammates to think he is the former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the team's new success rather than Cathy Lee's coaching. Too much pest and not enough sleaze makes it a big disappointment.
