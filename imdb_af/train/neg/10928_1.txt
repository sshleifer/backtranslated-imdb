Just saw this movie, and what a waste of time. The movie was predictable and slow. It's basically the bad news of Mormon, who plays church sanctions. Rather than watching this movie, I had to have a root canal. The cameo performances are naturally driven by sponsorship / funding. This film has potential because of the outrageous behavior exhibited by Mormons when playing church punishment basketball, but because it is PG, the true nature of the spectacle cannot be transferred to film. The acting is terrible, with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the movie was completely unnecessary.
