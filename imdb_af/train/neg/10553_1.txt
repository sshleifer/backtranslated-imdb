I bought this movie for 1 euro, didn't know what it was about. I thought "hmmm, a movie called mutilation man should be if it's not very funny at least filled with gore". It wasn't funny right. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I don't mind movie disturbances, but this one didn't mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the images was terrible. The acting ... there was no acting. Just a fcked-up fcker mutilates itself for more than 90 minutes. It is probably obvious for Sicko's dress at the extreme. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. It's not worth your time. It's just terrible. I wish I never bought it. <br /> <br /> They must mutilate the man who made it
