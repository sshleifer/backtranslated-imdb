*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I see a preview for this movie, I thought it would be at least a little admirable story. But like most superstations original movies, I was disappointed. This faithful family ends up driving this "deserted" village and finds this video camera to show that these people are doing everything they do and finding out that they are all disappearing, the family going through all these mysterious stages and never discovering or showing what heel is stalking them. They are more gaps than I can count and they explain nothing about what happens, how or what. It ends where the family comes in a car accident and becomes busy or brainwashed or something (never explained). The next thing you know is that they somehow find out how it all happened, but it ends up being totally confused.
