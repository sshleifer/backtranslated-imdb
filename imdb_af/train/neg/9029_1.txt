This movie virtually spills every actor's talents that can best be called a pot boiler. <br /> <br /> Despite the action-packed 'Top Gun' opening, it's been down there with many stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to bump yourself into your popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many deadly story lines in this movie. At one point I consulted that it was made by putting together a discarded TV series. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug Lord role is laughing and his 'partners' picked straight out of a 1970s Quinn-Martin policy show. Costner's character is wood and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with Mendez's wife. We also did not convince convincingly that the woman was hurt and would get the first warm body together. <br /> <br /> Definitely a B-movie and a great waste of time for everyone involved.
