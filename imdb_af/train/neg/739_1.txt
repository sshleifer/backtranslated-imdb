Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, are on the wrong foot the first step, assuming Wells wrote Gothic abomination and that all his lines are meant to be taken seriously. That is simply not true. Wells was a great heir of the Enlightenment, and his greatest concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction would make the British unprepared for the world that could produce the new technology - both good and bad. <br /> <br /> Two horrible consequences follow - the main character depicted as a wimpy screamer (I am reminiscent of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), rather than a man struggling to get the irony of an incredible to live out catastrophe; and the "Victorianisms" dialogue series seriously voiced Welles's intention to be the tongue in the cheek. <br /> <br /> It seems suspicious as Ed Wood, with a huge budget to waste on CGI effects - which has been so poorly achieved by the way - the Warner Bros. 1940s cartoon factory could work better done. (Gobs of splashed blood look like red balloons, I expected them to drift away at any moment.) Think of the Yellow Submarine as done by the old EG Comics. <br /> <br /> Worse still is the loss of the theme that robs the film of any reason to exist. Although the makers of this movie return the story to the Victorian era, they miss the incredible way. Wells's story predicted many of the horrors of World War I - a fact not unnoticed by the Wells itself, which after the war came to be the theme of things. <br /> <br /> Without any theme, all we have here is a lot of people running around in cartoon balloons when they're not trying to make a high school production of a drunkard's rewrite of Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Really, it's the worst, most senseless piece I've ever experienced since a friend spoke to me to see the Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago. . The film was so pretentious dull, my friend and I and two total strangers chased it halfway through the screen playing cards and using the movie to see the cards - its only use as <br /> <br /> But I did already electric lighting in my apartment, so I didn't need these wells for Wells. <br /> <br /> Don't avoid this movie - steal every copy you can (don't pay a penny) and burn each one. God, in His wisdom, just created us for this purpose.
