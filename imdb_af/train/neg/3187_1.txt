From the star of "MITCHELL", From the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are taglines that will normally keep me watching this movie. And the worst is that all the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats this movie every five minutes. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
