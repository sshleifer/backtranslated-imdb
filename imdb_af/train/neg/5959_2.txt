A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian Production. The brain fits perfectly with the words. Terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make it a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The mail production team looks like it gave up. What makes BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can save some ingenuity and consistency that is already joking? <br /> <br /> It's around Christmas. A mother and daughter are ever killed by one of the funniest villains. The next day, a rebel teenager is in trouble enough to be sent for a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a cop's head is cut down and a stranger is on his blood and a bloody ax told you. Some kids did, who would you believe? What begins as funny becomes boring and tiring after the end when the brain tries to be serious. A child cannot be afraid of the scary moments. The BRAIN is too funny a concept to be keen on. The Psychological Research Institute is bigger than large manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and his cohorts get credit for pulling from the worst acting I've seen. Viewer discretion strongly advised.
