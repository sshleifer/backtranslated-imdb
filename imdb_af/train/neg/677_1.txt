I am stirring to think what people of environmental consciousness had to think after seeing this broken remaining preachy-cinematic waste. Starlight makes someone who gives a damn over the planet, resembles a springing crystal-loving idiot. <br /> <br /> The plot has enough of Indian-wannabe nutrients and space-brother buffalo to buy a new-age store. ? Alien Rae Dawn Chong comes to lead a whistling underwear model in a mystical quest to prevent the Earth's imminent fall in the environment. But first they have to defeat an evil stranger who looks nothing like a refugee from a Castro street bar. Fortunately, they have a mystical grandfather, Willie Nelson, to help. (He looks embarrassed at the proceedings, and he should be) with buckets of cheap F / X and reams of useless swelling music. <br /> <br /> The clunky script helps to obscure the movie's intriguing plot and staggering tempo, but it's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg. Everyone involved in this film should recall their union cards until they have completed a true environmental science course.
