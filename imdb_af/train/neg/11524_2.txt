Nice incoherent film about a man who was left to a superficial hippie-religious cult of the 1960s, who fought them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cults hid from the police during an attack and is by another man named Hawk, who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of his followers or some of the people in town. It's hard to keep track of who characters are, or how long the screens are supposed to happen. The leader gets parole sixteen years later (I got it out of the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). No one is made to look a parent anyway. <br /> <br /> One murder is done with a large circular saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. I have never heard the title character's name in the movie, but he is the one who works the most, out loud and hollering. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost poorly pasted, with voice over (not much) to explain what's going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is beaten, and we hear the sound of a whip crack. A woman shoots a gun and we don't hear it, but rather hear a ricochet! It doesn't seem to have been done for comic effect.
