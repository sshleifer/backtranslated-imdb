Until the last 20 minutes I thought it might be Jackie Chan's worst movie (excluding her before 1978, of which I am not familiar). The final battle order has changed it all: it's long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to achieve that, you have to sit down through a "comedy" that can entertain five-year-olds (oh, somebody has thrown a tomato at his face) and endless "soccer" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (what the line "How do I turn it off? It's not a tap" - look to find out what it is referring to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for the final battle alone, but the rest of the movie is just for Jackie collectors, and even for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
