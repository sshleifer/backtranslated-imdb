My wife and I had a lot of hope for this movie, but it was a great disappointment. It was a native American version of Mr. Magoo. For example, a pathetic father who fails in everything, he tries to do. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in the process he often lays his son over several obvious things. Words can't express how bad this movie is. The children and the woman are really really making the movie sad. I don't get the humor, unless you like to laugh at other people who make a fool themselves. I can't see how it could come for awards. Save your money, it's not worth the rent.
