Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to go in the middle of the movie, but I resisted it. I don't know what Ridley Scott meant, but I learned that women in the army became so stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in a battle, and it is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And anyway, what was the last scene in Libya? Are they still fighting with Gadafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
