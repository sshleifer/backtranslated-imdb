I tried to find this movie by just seducing bad phrases about "teenagers and killing the man in his home" and such. I think I saw parts of this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old when it was on the cable. It made quite an impression! It's the kind of movie kids know they shouldn't watch and switch the channel when their parents enter. When I saw who was the role, I couldn't believe some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. . Then, if you want to see men being cheated on their wives, it's an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the dumbest end of all time, but still ... unforgettable.
