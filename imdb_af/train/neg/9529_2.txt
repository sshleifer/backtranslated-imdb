This 1977 cult film has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appearing at home of rich social doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to find help finding a residence they can't find no. But these two have other plans in mind. When they find out that George's wife is out of town, they eventually take control of the residence, hold the George down and kill a delivery hunt while destroying it all night. Bizarre and disturbing film, but the two just get rewarded in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. Most will not succeed, or they will be trapped in this ridiculous movie for about 30 minutes. Either way, some even consider it a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
