The only reason I comment is because I finally figured out why dr. Cox was bare. Although we probably all realized it at the same time, Dr. Cox bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies, dr. Cox, shave his head. It had to have been out of order for some strange reasons and forgot that they had slipped the continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They have previously made such mistakes. I remember when Elliot tried to show up Foley and her hair was wet for 2 seconds before water hit her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show has to build it up.
