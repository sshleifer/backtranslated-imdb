Well, I can't seriously think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers chose below the list. Can you think of something more dumb than five-six teenagers (who don't even act like a normal teenager) in the same packs. WITH DIFFERENT COLORS, YOU CAN APART SAY? Fans, have you ever gotten a real person folded against a spiritual wall and almost immediately get up and still fight without being injured? Power Rangers is for five-year-olds, and believe me, I never liked this show, even when I was five. <br /> <br /> I think you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. The teenagers actually work like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually works like a mentor, or no, a teacher. It has teenage humor, even though the fighting is lame, I hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say Power Rangers is a crap, but I don't want to. It would be an insult to crap. So face, five-year-old boys, Power Rangers are junk.
