I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll stay for 10). If a movie isn't good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it's probably never going to get better. I have another movie that disputes this theory. Then in Real Life is definitely no exception. I watched this turkey and thought; wow, it's not funny, doesn't touch, not sad, and I don't like any characters at all. <br /> <br /> The story of a consultant colonist / widower who erects three young daughters who invades love with his brother's girlfriend. I think the tagline would be "advice columnist who can use advice"? I do not know. Dance character never hit me if someone qualified to give advice. I think that's the irony? I do not know. He goes to his parents, brothers, sisters and their children to a kind of older retreat, which looks great and potential feed for good comedy, story lines ... no one ever occurs. The central story is basically how he likes this woman, but can't have her. Anyone with a wrist will realize that he will eventually get her, but you must suffer from the painfully indecent, trite, lifetime movie network "love killer" dialogue to come to the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
