The only thing I remember about this movie is two things: only when twelve years old, even I thought it was bumping. Secondly, it was so bad that when Mad magazine made a parody for it, they stopped at the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page and said they had completely denied it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period, try Animal House. It's so stupid and vulgar, it lowers it into high art. Another good choice would be Caddyshack, the classic with late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before becoming worse off. With big lines like Green Guard, Carl Spackler, "Correct me if I'm wrong. Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers, I'll lock myself up and throw the key."
