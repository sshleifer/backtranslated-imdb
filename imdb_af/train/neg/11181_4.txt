The movie is about two stories: one is a political murder of a call, the other a higher class political party. The intersection is the public relationship character that Al Paccino played, because he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is terrible without any proper dialogues and the direct void of a sense of drama, the performance of Al is unforgettable: how many fellows can be so convincing as a powerful and dreaded man (like "The Godfather" as here as a small servant (see also "Donnie Brasco"). /> <br /> Actually, the big young lion has become a tired guy. These passing centuries are moving a lot because it makes the audience know how to grow old. <br /> <br /> But its inertia is just a compilation because it can get its energy back in the Church scene. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's a good thing that the movie is so awful because it's the starlight on All's talent!
