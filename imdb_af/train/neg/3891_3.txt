I think my favorite part of this movie, the one that illustrates the sheer futility, stupidity and infinity of the proceedings, comes to the climax of the movie. Doctor Ted Nelson and his unmarried friend, the Sheriff, finally attacked the Melting Man on a flight of stairs in an electric generator. Keep in mind that Nelson searched the MM for almost the entire movie, and that the MM at this stage killed and ate several people (including his boss) and Nelson is well aware that MM is violent and hungry for human flesh. and blood. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff showed his gun on MM, who is, and I give the movie and Rick Baker props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form we've ever seen. And he shouts a very important question to Doctor Ted Nelson: "What are we doing now?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera cuts over to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it is clear that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently Ted was meant to be about the problem of finding the Melting Man. He never thought to bring a weld or a net wire, just a net, or a calming arrow, or maybe a New Age band through Vangelis around the wild animal. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panic and shoots, the Smeltman is going to berserk, and hilarity is occurring. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has been moving into the space-space program over the past 30 years, instead of going back to the moon or to Mars, as everyone knows they seem to be. be do. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the kind of lazy, lazy writing and direction that endorses every aspect of this movie. It's hard to tell how good the actors are, because the movie has contempt for their characters. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful rows also upset the stupidity of the proceedings: There's a scene with the clumsy Old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a forest, just by the Melting Man being torn apart. This scene is a nadir in the 70-year-old theater. I can guarantee that you have never looked at a more senseless and annoying setup with chicks that have been watching people throughout your life. And the Smeltman's assault on the woman living in the house holding a horse on the walls defends every attempt to process it. (VAT, I think the well-known film director Jonathon Demme has a run-up in this scene as the Redneck man who goes first to look at the home and never comes out again). The only thing the actress likes to chew the scenery literally is that, as I said, their horse apparently looked through it. And we are forced to watch her hysteria for at least two minutes longer than any SANE movie director will keep. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should beat the shit out of IMM's director and photographer. I remember him from an old Columbo episode where he looks much better than he does here - no one's idea of ​​a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one can be so unattractive in real life, as his director makes him look like this. <br /> <br /> Everyone else comes from a little better, except for the old couple (and locked up, I know they are playing for the laugh, but I'm not laughing!) but not much. <br /> <br /> It's definitely in the category "So Bad You Can Not Look Away" category disasters. Yet I want to see it again before I remember many other 70's and 80's abortions ("Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives At Night"), and MST's coverage is very nice, so If you get a chance, watch the MST version.
