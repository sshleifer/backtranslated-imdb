This movie was so unbearably bad, I could hardly believe I watched it. Directing, editing, production and writing all seemed to be done by junior high school students, who don't know much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (as earlier between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as one said at the beginning) are completely out of true and not drawn up, as they would be in a more elegant and effective movie made. Unfortunately, the characters are underdeveloped and make it difficult for us to have any connection with them. The acting, surprising, is not quite bad, but the terrible writing cancels the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western / epic, and unfortunately the fascinating (true) story that it tries to tell reduces. I have read many reviews that defend the film as important to Australians because of the subject. It's all good, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon, doesn't make the movie good. No one says the subject is not good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event for Americans, but that doesn't mean I will defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad. A failure around, although Heath and Orlando are beautiful to look at.
