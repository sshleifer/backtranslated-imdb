Why? Because for some reason there was never a spectacular scene in any movie like Ann Margret at the opening 'Bye Bye Birdie'. She also pushes it to the end (in another mood!). Both wonderful. Hire it and see it. All this is all you see. You will agree, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so excellent that it just didn't need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version have given them 'everything', but it's like trying to improve on 'Casablanca' - it just can't be done! It's even annoying to compare yourself with the two mentally if you try to appreciate the remake, and it just falls short without the actors' fault.
