The long list of "big" names in this movie (including the ubiquitous John Mills) didn't persuade me, so I couldn't judge the movie on its real merit. These are FULL stereotypes, caricatures, and standard, set scenes, from the humble air bait hero to the noisy pilot. The music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie was over: aloud, rising crescendo, great flourishing and ending then silence, but then the movie continued! I found no real storyline, random writing, but cleverly printed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons (pre-nose work) with an exciting little one. I can't say this picture has any of the ingredients that make a movie good. I found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.
