First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. Of the boring emotional films of the 70's and 80's, movies of this place actually started to contain some humor. Imagine .. Real comedies are made! Films began to be entertaining and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressed and boring. <br /> <br /> During the 90's and 00's, several really movies were made by a new generation of filmmakers. Movie after movie was praised by critics and played a lot of money. It has become the norm! <br /> <br /> Then United came ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Not once. Not ever. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we are used to making movie surly films, it's funny. Especially with a role like this with some very funny comedians. But .. They say or do nothing funny! Where is the humor? Show me the humor! Is this the awkward clerk Harald Eia played? Is this the totally ridiculous unrealistic football coach? Is this the commentary by Arne Scheie? The movie is just not funny! <br /> <br /> But it's not my main rant over United. This is the predictability. (And it's here, I fear Norwegian comedies have come to a standstill, because I've seen it in many other movies as well.) All the time you just know it's going to end well. All characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets exactly what they eventually earn. There is absolutely no place for surprises! <br /> <br /> All in all I can say that I was feeling bad after watching this movie. It was the one movie that made me realize that we are probably making some new blood in the Norwegian movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
