I was not impressed with this movie, especially since I went to the theater with my family to watch a movie that was 12A here in the UK. To my horror, this movie was embarrassing for sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but not good for children). This movie was sometimes temporary with fiery jokes, touching the groin, etc. ... and for most of the movie, not very funny. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is that Calvin Sims who is a 2-inch midget gets out of jail and steals a giant-sized diamond, but is then forced to put it in a woman's handbag. So the rest of the movie sees him leaving him as an abandoned baby to enter the woman's house so he can get this diamond back. <br /> <br /> So far, I enjoy most of the Wayans Brothers output - but this movie definitely takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> A little good advice - wait until it comes to TV or cable
