Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) hit their way through college. When the spectacular Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secret, he weakens them to help him play with a lovely, kind student, Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> Mute and incompetent "comedy" - much more green-inducing and laugh-inducing. Movie tries to lure its target audience with its disgusting gags - but nothing of them works. In addition, it is full of worthless, unattractive characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive that he is a big turnaround. Film even tries with the 50's / 60's sex pot / actress Mamie Van Doren in the film's most outrageous scene. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> It's also the absolute predictability and waste of veteran comedian actor Joe Flaherty's talent. When this parent no longer accepts every role that comes together and does something, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very attractive - and deserves it better. <br /> <br /> It doesn't get more than one in ten of me.
