Another rape of history <br /> <br /> This movie is a catastrophe; It just uses a historical story and makes a lovely love story, with bad acting and low budget. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3, they just dragged the time to make a mini series. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are so stupid and illogical, the soldiers are stupid, the costumes are a catastrophe. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they wanted to fight in a forest. In this film, the Romans prefer to fight in the city. > <br /> And so Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, meaning a light-skinned person.
