I really have nothing new to add, but I just felt I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Horrible. I run again through my MST3K DVD collection and I only watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really very painful, but it was next on the list. You can see that there is a small kernel of a real movie buried beneath all the "Hobgoblins" crap, but it just can't get out. Everything about this movie is 4th rate. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the ... ahhhh forget it. I can see a piece of crap like "The Bloodwaters or Dr. Z" over and over, with virtually no bad effects (I really find it a bit, it will be on the TCM later, October 2009 ), but "Hobgoblins" is a whole 'nother ballgame'. <br /> <br /> The worst part could be that it is about 12 hours after the movie ends, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medication, and yet the new music dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman sat in the lounge, still by my head. This torment will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, won't you?
