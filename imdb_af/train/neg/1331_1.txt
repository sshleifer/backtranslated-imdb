Collusion Course is even worse than the typical "evil white male corporate capitalist" movie of the week. This movie is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his underestimated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he performs, the claims of his character. This movie is so bad Leno's character, a sacred buffoon, is less annoying than Morita's character, a holy fool.
