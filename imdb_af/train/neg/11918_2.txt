It was a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie. In the movie I hoped it would be my sensible use of my time. Yes, I must admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval is truly commendable, but in spite of the best effort, this movie falls short on the effective transfer of a meaningful message. It turned out what Somnath Sen was trying to do. The final point comes short and the end was unsatisfactory after all that happened. A bit like real life in this respect, but movies other than real life end in about 2 hours and the end must be satisfied if it was the director's intention. It falls short of that and it makes me the most. <br /> <br /> Another worrying thing about me was the national stereo typing of the American characters - they all looked like the same block. It seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based on how ordinary Indians consider themselves Americans, and that it is clear that no attempt was made to bring any Americans into the film a sense of depth or complexity. /> <br /> These two aspects put them together for a disappointing story.
