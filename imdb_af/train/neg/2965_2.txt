This movie was interesting. I had to look at it for a college class across India, but the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing if it doesn't contain very cold, hard information about those details. It is not really the truth of the synopsis, until the end where they connect all the elements together. However, the gore factor is excellent. Even right at the beginning, you want to look away because the gore is quite intense. Just look at this movie if you want to see a little cool, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you have lost time listening to it. I saw rumors on other sites about this real-life movie, but you can't find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
