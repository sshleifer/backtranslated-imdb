This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's about as much as hard handwork with stomach cramps. The movie starts bad (I will evaluate a 1/10 for the first few minutes of the movie) and then it gets worse, minute by minute. The only way to judge it at all will be a kind of abysmal spiral negative number that grows for ninety minutes. Onfunny is not a real word, but best describes the humor in this video. Somehow, the video even manages to break out cute, scantily clad women and sex. Grotesque and unpleasant. This movie is incredibly bad. I would say it would be better to stick with the TITANIC theme over and over and with Buscemi's character of ESCAPE FROM LA drone in your ear than watching this movie. The successors aren't nearly as bad. If you have to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather look back at 5 Tony Little infomercials than to see CLASS or NUKEM HIGH again. Don't get me wrong, it has taken a kind of criminal genius to make a movie so horrible and if it ever earned a movie, it's an award to be horrible.
