I saw this DVD in my friend's house and thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood not very big names. Interestingly, I decided to give a shot later. It was a difficult experience to believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credit roll, I said, "Our Turks really suck in Hollywood movie entertainment. It's an insult to the heist | hostage-movie genre ... But wait! I've checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary, it was literally shot in America with a US director and crew! It made me think again! How can you name like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong Or even persuade Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project - probably with money, which I thought further - how can you raise so much money to provide them and a so-called international role? has come to find the answer, by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew you can get, and if you still have trouble adjusting your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce, or vice versa, I have no information about it bottom line is not a bad movie, because everyone is so eager to offer. It makes you think - in my case, even meditates - and there are many movies out there that don't even affect. This one at least reminds you; It makes you wonder. It leaves you with unbelief .. and then it makes you wonder again.
