I watched the entire film recognizing William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch's participation. I'm glad I had no idea about Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the film I said, "This was Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for excellent performance. Weller played a great character, and his performance was such that I didn't even recognize him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot was bad, the writing was bad and the performances, except those of Nosbusch and Weller, were subpar. The scenery and surroundings were interesting, and Weller was wonderful. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, of a possible 10.
