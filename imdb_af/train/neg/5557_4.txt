OK, but it makes it a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. It's not much to recommend. I found it very slow, annoying. numbers one and two were somewhat predictable, but not so much. I also felt that this movie was sometimes almost champion, which I don't really think fits this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the biggest bad man in this installment. He's a decent enough actor, but I felt he also played his character above the top. I think it fits the tone of the movie, which would have been good if I had the movie.plus. There were some bad one liners. Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but is given little to work in this movie. The character didn't really develop, as I had hoped. Well, that's just my opinion. And now, for me, while this movie is not uncomfortable, it's pretty bad. My voice for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
