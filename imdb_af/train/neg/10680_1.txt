SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies ever made - it's so simple. There is no reason for quality over this movie. The first 10 minutes are very difficult - they actually lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes running stolen and bad scenes without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, looks like an aquarium, and has the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show their advanced teleportation powers, such as Alex Thomas who falls in the lake (drunk), and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon sparked an avid performance like Kate, who got worse through the last minute fifth-degree continuum fracture dialogue. An example of this would be when she said, "Flashlight!" in such a stupid way that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it catches half. Finally, editing this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrible thing I have ever seen. It was as if the camera men were a lot of chimpanzees that scientists got video cards. An example of this is when we suddenly get a headlight from Alex's car. I would bet there was little time to change this movie. The end was absolutely pathetic. The authors apparently tried to create a kind of mysterious plot line that the viewer said, "Oh yes!" Instead, we are left to see a dull painting of a spider that somehow fits in the story line. Unfortunately, there is no perspective in the millions out there that can save this movie from a physical piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I give it a .5 out of 10, the .5 being that this movie was shot on film instead of becoming a picture book.
