The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr High School play. The cinematography is not bad, but it seems to have been cut with a cup. I couldn't decide if it was a deliberate hokey flick, or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People are running around in a 'lawless' modern city with a fast draw 6 rifle rods. It has more than its fair share of cutsey stuff. Picture the Good Boys up to an old farmhouse, and park the Ford Mustang right in front of a train bar. Photos of the clerk in a hotel look at a naturally Western (hemisphere) film that plays a Japanese soundtrack, but with English subtitles. It's all really strange, but can be improved if you see it while taking a little peyote. This is a true curiosity with modern parallels with every Western movie clique you can think of. There is even a modern version of the kind-hearted dance hall girl, and a compelling Jewish harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings it to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell your DVD player dead.
