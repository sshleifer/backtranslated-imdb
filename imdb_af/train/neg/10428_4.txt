Did anyone else feel so betrayed as I did? The first hour or so was pretty solid, but the last. Oh my god. It seemed to be predictable and cheese. Not big and epic like the whole run of the show was. Most reviews have been read glowing, but I really don't understand why. I seriously predicted that the general WEG was over at the end, but then withdrawn because I thought "No, they will never do it, it is VERY too lame." I can barely stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm going to run the door to sell every season I own. Someone please. Change my mind. I want to like it. So bad. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Great display. Terrible end.
