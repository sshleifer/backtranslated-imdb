My wife and I just finished this movie and I arrived on IMDb to communicate with the judges that this movie has found less than satisfactory. Of the 10 pages reviews are only a handful of negative. I feel that this movie is a good concept, is terribly wrong and I want those who want to watch the film warns. Warn me, I'm more inspired to write reviews when I do not like a movie than if I do it, so my handful reviews are all negative. Yet this does not mean that I'm biased not to enjoy a movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews of movies that I enjoy. <br /> <br /> Paris you t'aime is the most pretentious movie. I've seen in years. By using an "intelligent" concept and some great talent to some of the WAY to connect many short stories, the movie ends the worst of all worlds. It is art for the sake of art, but something that can dream and achieve a 2-year-old. To let the director free reign 5 minutes screen time, prove why there is a division of labor, even in entertainment. Directors can not write, writers can not register. (I would also like to throw in that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but it is because he is an actor, director (which rarely works either)). <br /> <br /> What ends on the screen is a mess heap of stories that do not make sense, is not completed in 5 minutes and a total surprise to me Paris. Why call it Paris your t'aime when a more bytheway title cluster f * ck is? There are only a few stories that were vigilant, especially the piece by Alfonso Cuaron, but everything will fall into obscurity. The Coen brothers shortly wise, but you can have a movie of their calls that do not contain a scene with a guitar guitar? It is as if all the directors have decided to do what they want, and choose Paris as the place to do it. As we keep all of Paris, included the current company, we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS. In fact, I think they have the directors' names on each of the shorts as directors see how poor of a film it and decided to make sure that they are blamed for their only 5 minutes. Seriously. Seriously. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress. She is not a dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you people actions of other movies action or fix? I look at your Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elia Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Mary Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> One last comment on the play I give double kudos to Nick Nolte for the action and look more human than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again. Find his brief on youtube for his 5 minutes is quite nice. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult, and only a handful of writers got it right. I think of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It's much harder than writing a complete novel and just the truly talented can reach it. The same can be said about short films. It seems that only one director in the annals of history will continue. <br /> <br /> If you maintain Paris as a jeweler to discover and reflect through your own lenses with your own story, don't expect to enjoy this movie at all. The directors did not care or was not lazy. In any scenario, by the time you read this, it means that you have hired them. Price that you did not pay 10 dollars per head in theaters.
