I was initially happy to know about a new superman movie, but it would be fine, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> It's a bad copy of the Richard Donner work, Lex is another villain who no longer plays, even played by Kevin Spices. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same from Donner's first movie, but much forced. <br /> <br /> The writing is predictable and simple (all things Luthor finds in a museum or an old woman). <br /> <br /> The story is the wrong thing, it must be the Kevin Smith script and may be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope a sequel without Brian Singer and a new talent director will do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> Everyone reads you later.
