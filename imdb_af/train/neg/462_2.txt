It should come as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Awful acting, awful script ... and they were the good points! One to be sure to miss! The jokes, if you could call them, were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still trusts her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I was willing to give it a chance, hoping it would improve, which unfortunately did not! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you sit down for a good read! I love Denise Richards, and so I gave this movie a go, but why she threw herself into this movie is outside me!
