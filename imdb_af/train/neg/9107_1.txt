I was crazy, nobody made this movie. I was even more angry. I lost valuable minutes of my life to see it. I could have had a laundry and was more entertaining. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a little confused, but then I got caught up and realized what was going on. By now, the movie was halfway through, and yes, I'm an exhibitor, but I always want to see things to the end. So I jammed it, I watched it all. Not only are the actors as attractive as in cruel intentions, they are not convincing. I saw my cousin cry for more convincing attention than the alleged lust displayed on the screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting, watch it.
