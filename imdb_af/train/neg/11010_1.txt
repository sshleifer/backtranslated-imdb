This movie doesn't even earn one. It was a total waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was challenging and disgusting. My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is full frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is no plot line, the actors are horrible, the accent is terrible, the actors are little time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt (who only had a fifteen second). I think it might have been a mistake on the directors and editorials, but they repeat the same segments two or three times and only add a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A movie similar to this is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing movie in existence. There is no plot line and is not funny. Although it is not funny. Don't see any movie.
