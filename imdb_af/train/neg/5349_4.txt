This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the box of Rick Moranis's career. Like the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a fast cash collection; It's a lazy referral with Moranis who accidentally shrinks himself and some family members, so they can repeat all the best scenes of the original movie. Immediately dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cute lingerie, which did nothing to make me think of the days of The Incredible Shrinking Man, when this kind of thing was done properly. Shockingly, it is directed by the best film Dean Cundey, who has to keep up the job the next day or choose better material.
