Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie (again) was tried for her life. Because the faithful dog is sleeping on her master's grave, she must be killed by law. Strange, it is also explained that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which apparently is also against an old Scottish law. If there is no owner after three days, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) pleads for Lassie's case, leading to a prolonged play, showing Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp (like John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although based on an interesting, original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie", several earlier Lassie situations are repeated; and it doesn't improve on them. Comparatively speaking, this one is sloppy and unspeakable; and this is a disappointing sequel to "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and several of the other artists may be charming, but cannot elevate this one. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "This is a wonderful life") is one of the notable children who support Lassie; much later he will grow up to marry Dark Shadows, enchanting Angelique (Lara Parker).
