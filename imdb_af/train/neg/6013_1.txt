I've read every book in the back of the series to date, and the movie doesn't make any of them right. Certainly, I saw worse movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The writing was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors were reading their lines, rather than actually saying it. The characters were stiff and unattractive. The effects were cheesy and look terribly false. The end was terrible. First, it didn't even go completely through the first book. Secondly, it doesn't make sense. If you haven't read the book, you have no idea what is going on. It must have been the most cute, movie-studded end I've ever seen in a movie. I'm upset that I actually paid for this movie. If it happens to a miracle, it becomes widespread, it needs to be completely refurbished and taken over by Hollywood. These two wannabe film producers, and the wannabe director, should leave films to the professionals.
