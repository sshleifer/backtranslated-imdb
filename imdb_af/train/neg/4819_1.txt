This is a typical low budget 1970's mess. It's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew that is hunting Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the Native American to the cynical cowboy. The acting and narration is a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of bigfoot - keep hope. There won't be much, and what can you do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; it will look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I didn't enjoy the 1970s low prize money; I do. It's that it's such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, lousy story and no excitement you just can't enjoy. It doesn't fit in the "so bad it's good" category, and you can't even laugh at how bad it is without the help of illegal substances. It is usually a very boring footage of the people who camp, walk, ride horses, and watch the wild life. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely stupid; our sasquatch supposedly threw on the campers from the top as they fired their guns back on him. By that time you are threatening for bigfoot to drop a few rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing.
