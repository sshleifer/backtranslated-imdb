I can't describe how horrible this movie is. Am I the only one to find the way to be his animated totally disgusting? The men of Rohan look 100% fake with their poorly-colored hair, not even close to what the actors look like. The Orcs looked terrible. Why is gandalf running with a bad limp? Why can't they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others who sounded like horrific statements * of Tolkien's characters. Everyone and everyone remains the studio that made it, the plug pulled out, it was just a terribly awkward adjustment. Check out the hobbies cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkien's work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 10/02
