As a lesbian, I am always looking for movies about gays and lesbians. But with this kind of crap out there, it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story to develop, or just to make sense. Nor did it occur. It was just meaningless scenes, unrelenting in any way with anything. The film did not convey any kind of story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense I simply turned it off. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it doesn't even deserve it.
