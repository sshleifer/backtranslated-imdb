Wouldn't it be great if Not another Teen movie actually put an end to all this stupid, mindless, do I get more sex than you teenage movies? In a perfect world, yes. Yet this one is even worse. This one is not humiliating for the stars, it is humiliating for the distributor. All the jokes are basically college students who expose things that people probably have no interest in seeing, but it's "funny." Devon Sawa, who was really good at Final Destination, is just as boring in this movie. It makes you wonder if it's the right way bad. Degree: F
