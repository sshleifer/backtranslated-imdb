I'll just be vague about my possible perishable comments. There are plenty of canned plate elements in this movie that are essentially pre-rejected. <br /> <br /> This movie kills some ideas from a Southern classic, a Mockingbird. I think maybe TKOM got its ideas from any source. Anyway, after watching it, you'll say, "Oh yes, it's a ripoff". <br /> <br /> I think the truth entertaining thing about this McMovies is once you've identified a plate element, find out if they're going to the original or trying to turn it around. Not much turns in this one.
