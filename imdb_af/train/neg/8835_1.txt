Before I watched this movie, I read a review saying that this movie might be one of the best movies ever! ha ha Scene by scene growing the tension in order ... of the annoying characters in this movie. From the little girl talking to the little one and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer who just ran around without notice (and who was the guy on the beach talking to the boy!). Things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this movie. As I watched, the movie seems to go in one direction, it just goes nowhere, but in a new direction ... and over and over ... <br /> <br /> The play is great, but the writing is terrible. Every character, in every scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic and the reactions of the co-cast / extras are simply strange. There are no resolutions for the problems being developed by the film, making it confusing and ultimately a great waste of time.
