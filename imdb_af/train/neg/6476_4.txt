I had such high expectations for this movie because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney is trying to make the art of straight-to-DVD successors perfect. They deserve a raid. Several, in fact. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely terrible and the story wasn't much better. What happened to the great music Disney had in their movies. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and The Hunchback or Notre Dame. They have made so many fantastic movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to make successors who aren't even good enough to put in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not an indication of things that will come to the Walt Disney Corporation.
