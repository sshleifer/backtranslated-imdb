I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibition. This definitely prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibition, and in retrospect it should probably be. <br /> <br /> Apart from the big count (Bjork) and photography rich and colorful, the content was mostly boring and predictable. Well, I really need to see someone wearing pearls to find out what the worlds were. The movie was mostly a stupid mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whale technology used in a mock hunt / crop. The movie "squeakes" with enough gratuitous shock to change your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the movie? While others may argue that this is an anti-whale hunt, one can argue equally that it somehow justifies whales. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "flash" the audience with his anal, faeces, self-reduction and cannibalistic fetishes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Unless you really go to Barney's art, don't watch this movie. The message is dark, the pace slow, and the cultural references pretentious. If you're watching jogging, you'll do better at one of the many "Undead" movies or kick off an old copy of Hustler and take a fake cartoon.
