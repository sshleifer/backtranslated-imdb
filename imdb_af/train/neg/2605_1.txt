Although I recently put it on my 10 worst movie list, I have to say it's probably not worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or any of the "Look Who's Talking" order. Still, it's quite misleading, even with sexy Drew Barrymore who plays something of a horror movie response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York City to Los Angeles, but finding out she is looking like a killer be. Poor Sally Kellerman, an exciting actress of great praise in the 70s, is here saved to a poorly supporting role. Barrymore's leading man, George Newbern, is the worst kind of sitcom actor. The picture is swill, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (though out of a Scooby Doo episode) is interesting. But as for the final ... be real! Who had to clean that mess? * of ****
