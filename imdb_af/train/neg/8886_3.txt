Not very impressed. It's hard to spoil this movie because there's almost no plot development. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there it looks like the paint is dry. The play also looks very poor, reminding me of the old black and white Maoist eraf movies that are occasionally broadcast on Chinese television. Although it is difficult to tell the female role, it seems that Yuwen, like the story, just wants to walk her like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the faded star Gong Li who somehow has a good reputation as a good actress in the West for a long time on her face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's movie, The Blue Kite, was a much better movie. But don't be fooled by the fact that spring was in a small town in the late 40's. Unlike the Blue kite, the fact that this movie is set in a time of revolution is unimportant to the plot itself. The ruins of the village look nothing more than a picturesque backdrop. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and calls on a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a "beautiful" 'deep' or 'hypnotic' film and one that is just boring and insignificant. <br /> <br /> If any movie fits the description of 'overestimate', this is it. I see no reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
