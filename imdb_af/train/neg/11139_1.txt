There's not much to say about this movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> The play and dialogue are far from even decent, the story of the hybrid wolf is not well explained and the whole thing has holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you don't want to see. It is so amateurish that it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on the DVD was in the Extras. The gag rules. Everything else, just waste time and money. I hope nobody will buy it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from here.
