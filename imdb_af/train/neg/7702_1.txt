I am a black man living in a predominantly black city. That said, I have some great concerns about Tyler Perry's work. I realize that some people are out of the need to praise him because he is black and tries to portray a positive image of the culture. But I honestly believe that Perry White would have had the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson about his ass. <br /> <br /> I have been forced to see this movie one hell of very recently and every repeated look makes my blood boil. The characters were poorly written and performed. The jokes are so bad, I have to be told that something is funny. I'm just going to shoot this big pile. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character might have been calling, but it doesn't. When the only thing she ever tries to do is to kill children and threaten adults, she is less than useless. She is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The woman beat fianc√© situation was horsesh-t. If a woman was so scared of her husband's death, why would she try to run away if he was sleeping in bed. Wouldn't it make sense for her to leave when he was at work. Anyway, the characters in this bow were so annoying and persuasive that I hoped he would throw her from the balcony and know royally if he didn't. <br /> <br /> Then there are the two love birds. A bus driver asks a woman by bothering her while making his rounds. I could not believe it. I really couldn't believe when she agreed to go even more with him. But what the cake is like is that a grown man has been reduced to throwing pebbles at a window and taking notes like a ten-year-old by a saucepan mega. I don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two ways. Morose victim and psychotic mom. No matter which of these two faces she showed, but there was one constant. The bus driver was not going to get any. He even married her without tasting the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there's the family reunion scene. Here we grind the maternal charge containing implied blood stick taboo for grinding, shirtless, excessive muscle bonding, b-ball, plus the good taste of Maya Angelou. When those babes dragged their bucks and called a meeting, I was wrong to wish the elders were being demanded by a heart attack. All this crap is going on at the reunion, with nice easy to separate groups, and then they call a bell. When they do, everyone drops what they do and heads over for a strict talk, just like a pack of Pavlov's doggies - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. In it we see the abusive fiancee being treated by his long-standing victim and all the bad actress. There is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to see it so far, except to test your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain of this story will also hand her ass to her. Guess what, it doesn't. Instead, Perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safely, ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure, if I have given a day, I can probably write a doctoral thesis on all the ways this movie sucks. Don't start me on the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I'm just going to say it. In my opinion, as a black man, D.W. Griffith's legacy remains. The irony is that it is done by a black man who will be praised for doing what the nation's birth did and selling us in the river. I just wish Perry's films were dudes so I could kick them in the nuts. Thank you, dude !! What are you going to follow in 2009, a comedy about the rape and cruel slaves of slaves in colonial America?
