Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" was filmed again and released through Faith Films to the home video in the USA. <br /> <br /> The original story is about a priest who has to look over the witch's body with his faith. to protect him. Extensively expanded and established in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (the houses, clothing and furniture are in spite of the English signs), it is a strange film that doesn't really work. This is the strange institution that is trying hard to be America, but it is clear. There are also some strange, deliberate oblique moments, as the main character is a reporter at the beginning and a priest shortly afterwards. I'm not sure why they did it, even after watching the piece on the DVD. The other problem is the dubbing that is over. It is so done that everyone talks when their lips are not on the camera, or if they are the voices, they do not even match the lip flaps. I don't know if she's Faith Films wrong or those of the producers who made the film, hoping to shower in the West (revealing in the making of a piece). <br /> <br /> The movie is not very good. As I said, it has all sorts of technical issues that just make it a strange balkurio. Despite some very good horror images, the movie never works as a horror movie. As a film to gain faith, it is much to be confused in this resale to ensure that someone feels closer to God. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I give it a pass, even at a bargain price. My advice would be to find the 1960s version of the story Viy, which will bring some chills and some understanding of faith in God.
