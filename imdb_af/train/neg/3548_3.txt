For those who love depressing movies with messy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! Out of the dark New York City atmosphere, exceeded as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, for two different main characters without much morality, this movie is a real downer. <br /> <br /> Why it won the Oscar was because it was so shocking at the time that Hollywood, its new freedom to show something it wanted with all moral codes, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers were then like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood has theater viewers (probably for the first time) a rape, prostitution, homosexuality, childhood, homelessness and other such wonderful sights and sounds, but only its twisted brain would be attractive ... and then his work. <br /> <br /> It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it passed that level. Obedience was astonished at what they said and heard, and the academy, proud of itself to display filth and at the same time make money. However, it cannot help to give honors on this piece of gilded garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I also found this movie fascinating. However, if I see it again in the 1990s, I left such a bad taste in my mouth, I never saw it again. <br /> <br /> The play was good, but what? Acting is good in many movies. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good at his younger days playing out. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and then later the "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is not 'art' and it is not worthy of its many awards; It only heavily pushed the envelope in 1969 and therefore it is so reminiscent of the hearts of filmmakers and critics. It is two hours of wickedness and extremely messy, religiously cheap shots, glorification of weirdos (Andy Warhol even comes to action - no surprise) and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I had like the catchy song, "Everyone's Talking" that helped to make Harry Nilsson known, but even it was dirty because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before Nilsson did this ... and few people ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And as mentioned, the name "Ratso Rizzo" stays with you! <br /> <br /> The movie is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: it marked it as "official" that Hollywood had gone down in the toilet, and it has since been in the sewer stayed.
