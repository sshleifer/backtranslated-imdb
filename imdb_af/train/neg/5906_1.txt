This movie was terrible. The plot sucked, the acting was bad, the editing was inactive and this movie made me want to stick out my eyes. I wish I had the time to watch this movie back. The balloon scene was dumb, the Mormon jokes are very old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two leaders, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local "celeb" cameos. as fast as I want .. "computer idiot. What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed it. This movie helps to create a long line of unbridled efforts to LDS consolidate beliefs in Hollywood, say Die RM, the church ball, etc. Etc. I will watch this movie and first put the first head in a brick, you will be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a view display.
