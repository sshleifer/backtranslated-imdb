Can I give it a minuscule? No? Well, let me say that this is the most horrible movie I've ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in various sub-levels of nebulosity. I hired this movie with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hope it would be better, we decided to go a little ahead to see if things could get better. It never gets better. This movie about a few men kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting, but in reality it's just a drill. Nothing even distracted ever happens. If you ever get the chance to see it, do yourself a favor, PLAN "NINE FROM OUTSIDE SPACE".
