This movie had no big stars in it, but played a very good role with excellent supporting actors AND Gene Tierney before she became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you'll expect more of the movie than it's actually delivered. Most of this I suspect is due to a two-day script, as director Henry Hathaway, a capable and established man at the helm. <br /> <br /> The film is in East Africa during World War II. Just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while subversive Nazi elements are trying to provoke local population problems. One of the white men in the movie is a double trader - working for the destruction of the British Empire! But, lovely Tierney, who plays a sultan's daughter (!), Helps save the day for the good of Britain. <br /> <br /> For a long time, American filmmakers have had an abundance of pro-empire films with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s. Nowadays, with altered sensitivities, the idea of ​​dying the happy black natives for queen and country seems ridiculous - and it will be difficult to root on either side! In this day, however, this propaganda piece was effective in supporting the British. Although the film is seen today, it suffers from a lengthy screenplay. The one bright moment in the movie is the last performance between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after such a powerful scene, the movie just seems to talk and talk - to lose its punch.
