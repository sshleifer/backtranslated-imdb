This movie begins promising, with an early scene in which Frank Morgan gives advice against Gary Cooper's marriage to his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, who plays an unashamed gold digger, complains to Cooper on his alleged penny in the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (in my mind) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise is a very sweet, versatile and undervalued actress rarely starred. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and although she is not blessed with great variety, she usually delivers heart-warming actions. <br /> <br /> From a promising opening, the story moves all the way down to the end. I didn't find anything to burn Cooper's house cleaners. The butler in such a versatile, non-smoking household will never just leave, so Cooper can continue to smoke, or alternatively, he will definitely provide him with the way to sell his bad cigarette. In addition, anyone with any common sense will allow himself to keep a light cigarette without asking for a way to sell it. And finally, nobody in his right mind breaks a cigarette into a handkerchief and puts it in his pocket! This whole series just made Cooper look foolish and gauche. It is a bad outrage - inventing and filming sick in a way that doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The forced medical examination of Cooper is also being adapted. No one allows himself to undergo a full medical examination without being notified or giving his consent! That Cooper has done this is to be removed from the reality of being funny - it's absurd! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense and it is also nothing to laugh about. Lastly, the scenes of Cooper's overly versatile, neurotic attention to his baby's diet and weight may have hit a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety about their newborn babies. But it just seems boring and slow to me. The wardrobe and stamping sections went over the screens, while the writing writer went paradoxically. <br /> <br /> The lines are just not in the writing to generate humor. They just miss all cylinders. The lag is not a mile per minute, but more like a light year-a-minute. The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera. <br /> <br /> The completely wasted scene is when both Cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are called in the same hotel. room together. There is probably a rich moisture of humor somewhere in that mine, but nothing has been withdrawn. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two very nice girls will be hurt. Predictable, it's the Anita Louise character, screaming at her will-wedding evening! While not on camera, it's her fate, and it's not very funny - even as a loose end. She did nothing in this movie to make me impersonal (other than Gail Patrick, say, in My favorite wife). As a result, I expected (maybe "hope" is a better word in the context of the movie!) For Anita Louise to also enjoy a happy ending. The fact that such a beautiful character is essentially wiped out at the end of the movie really undermines the effect of the "happy ending" for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I was still waiting for something to happen, for the spiritual dialogue so characteristic of films of the era ... And it never did. A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is completely wasted here.
