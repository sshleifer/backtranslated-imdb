Well, to answer one's question, "why doesn't anyone remember this movie?" This is because many people didn't really see it in 1978 and it hasn't been shown much on TV ever since. (If it is on video that will be my news!) Even in the era of sometimes indifferent comedies in the 70s, the movies had the clever to avoid this movie. Unless they like Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers, "that" a lot! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was harder on "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career laughed at making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenter's lack of weight! Har-ha Joan! It also appears that every "somewhat famous" name of the era is in the movie. (Surprisingly, Doris Roberts is later from "Everybody Loves Raymond".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, a pretty good idea for a storyline, a man who gets pregnant instead of the woman goes here away. With the help of a male friend, Crystal is set up with a hooker to eventually lose his virginity, but because she is "up" instead of him, he becomes pregnant! (A commentary on women taking power away from men). <br /> <br /> Crystal's stomach grows, it goes through all the female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now wiping out a social misunderstanding! He is attacked by a crowd who wants him to erase. <br /> <br /> He is forced to go in isolation to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you want, a crib (God knows where it's gone!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> All of this movie is worthless and forgotten. The humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some good and relevant moments w / Billy Crystal. I ignore the rest of the Rabitt test, it's faint big time! <br /> <br /> I can't believe Roddy McDowell was not signed! (END)
