At the Tobe Hooper's jewel, Crocodile, I developed a great interest in the college / crocodile exploitation / monster genre in 2000. I am looking forward to a nice producer who is following up with several persecutors on these delicious chocolates of charity. If only Ed Wood can bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monks that create crocodile special effects on a computer, we will be just a piece of crown feeder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek drill implants. <br /> <br /> While Tobe Hooper's crown opening called his own movies, Blood Surf decided to take out a lot of aging themes from the other movie's chum bucket. See if you can watch the revenge of the Nerds sequels to find the surprises / guests? / Rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Also try to find the ready-to-watch fade that the editor has given up to make the inventory. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the crocodile could not try its lottery voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmental conservation ... or crown valuation, but the quasi-captain Ahab of the story gets his tour of the power. Perhaps in the years to come we will see a crocodile galloping for a shooting in a golden sunset. Or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocodile in the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploding roll of zero-G monkey / midget / crocodile bloodshed. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music has irritated me.
