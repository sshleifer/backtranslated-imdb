With a title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and liberal help from Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully clear that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut over the usual kind of garbage that our British cinema looks at. "Robert Carmichael" (for short) poses as a realistic study of juvenile alienation and at the same time apparently a criticism of the Iraq war. The problem with realism is that the characters are so unceasingly unrealistic and atypical - unlike the fiery imagination of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug addict rapists. As a criticism of the war in Iraq, a film about the violence of young people (by a talented classical musician - subtextual community damaging this sensitive individual) is so infantile that it hardly considers it. There are signs of technical ability, but some reviewers have over-emphasized it. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire to be shocked by allegedly serious intent can be the worst movie of the recent movie. People like "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but mostly liked to feel culturally better than they hated most. So much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) calls it here as one of the most moronic films in years. (I'm not against violence in the movie. To do this seriously is a tough trick though - people in theaters cheered Alex in "Clockwork Orange" showing how Kubrick's supposed intention was missed. much easier to reach and less offensive than the pretensions of many art film directors.)
