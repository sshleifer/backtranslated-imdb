If I could, I would give NEWS stars for this one, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is no single scene I can laugh about, but the game didn't make me. don't laugh either. So if you're a couple of badly delayed people, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have done here. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in a movie where children are shot dead to get humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I wasted my time to see a Boll movie and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> U / 10 ... I'm ashamed to be from the same country as yours! <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE KEEP HIM FROM MORE MOVIES !!!!!
