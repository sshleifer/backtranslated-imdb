This film has potential and I was prepared to try it, but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow to treat like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Standing power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way was introduced in the middle to late seventies. To be realistic this film should be introduced in the fifties, even if it wasn't the late forties. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando who Carlito apparently ran in his "hey-day". None of the primary characters in the original movie were in this movie. We are supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the team of a few years. <br /> <br /> Stand up for power with Carlito walking on the beach and talking about retirement in the paradise he wanted to do in the original movie. Also, the pre-quel creates the Rocco and Earl characters - what should they do to them, as they clearly aren't in Carlito's Way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito can have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original movie, and watch the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci's in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he is in prison with five of them. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. <br /> <br /> Obviously no one is interested in telling a good story and that they are more interested in making money by making an average gangster movie and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante in the story. The movie has some good moments, but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand on its own instead of making it a predictive for Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you are determined to watch this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. Think of it as the Spaghetti Westerns with Clint Eastwood's unnamed man, in other words, two movies that share the same character, but are not necessarily connected.
