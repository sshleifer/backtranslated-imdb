Having seen the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 production of Beowulf & Grendel, which I thought was brilliant and beautiful, I approached it - the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies that are being challenged this year - with excitement. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horn helmets, I sighed. It was Migration Era Sweden and Danne, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never carried horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock off your helmet and then break you). Then there is Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not the 6th century of Denmark. The swords and weapons look like props left over from previous films set in different historical periods. I saw weapons that could be used by Crusaders in the Kingdom of Heaven, and one character even wore a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction film worth of Beowulf & Grendel! In addition to the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dishonest and the acting was completely wood and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret weapon crossbow, complete with the scope of observation and explosive projectiles, which seem to have been bought by Iraqi insurgents. The special effects monster and his mother were so steroid that Beowulf could never tear off an arm as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I can go on, but I won't.
