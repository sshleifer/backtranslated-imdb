Boy oh boy oh golly giving, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was the hilarious bluescreen effects used to create Mommy's "invisibility". They looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal, and not even in a good way where it is so funny that you love the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't end up enjoying this movie. The attempt at steadicam shots was also very pathetic. I mean, hey, if they have a low budget, it's fine. You can still make a good movie with a low budget. But, a BAD movie and low budget AND effects. It makes for a bad combination. In this case, such a damned combo has the craptastic film, "Invisible Mom." Created. If you have children, and your children have no taste, they may be awake by all this.
