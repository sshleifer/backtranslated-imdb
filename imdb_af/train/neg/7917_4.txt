"Cement" is a bad film about a bad police spokesperson (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad attitude that has a bad man in a bad way to his cajones in fast-drying concrete. While waiting for the cement to dry and the movie to figure out what it is all about, we are returning regularly, without any rhythm or reason, so we can see opportunities that lead to the cement case. A bad junk in general, "Cement" suffers from a lack of a story, a clumsy execution and the most ubiquitous of movie's flaws; no need to care. A time killer for the needy bank potato at its best.
