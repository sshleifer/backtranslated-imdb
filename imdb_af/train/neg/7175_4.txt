It may be based on historical events, and we know that the makers of this TV document have taken drama freedoms to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was just as badly done! I was surprised in the case of an emerging mid-day crisis, how calm everyone seemed, surely someone would have panicked and what a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort apparently - come to mind! Not sure about the regulations, but some of the airline security devices nowadays look like OTT nonsense, but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing, common sense says it's not a good idea! The shots of this massive aircraft coming on this remote landing strip were inconclusive and false. In fact, it was an incredible sight seen from the ground up in the environment, in this movie it was out of proportion and resembled the model it was likely to have. Escape lists appeared before and middle emergency doors, but no one appeared to be out of the front, although the drop was much less. The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? it has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to fuel, but fuel had to be on the bottom of the tanks, and the explosion risk had to be a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost calm. , and everyone is standing at the foot of the escaped slides instead of getting as far as possible, as I would have expected. There were just too many contradictions, mistakes and forged actions in this. I would have preferred to see a show of the drama in real time, and with realistic movement of the airplane depicted. It had the potential to be very exciting, but undoubtedly failed due to budget constraints and we felt that a plane that lost all engines would not really be, and you would go safely to a bulky landing, but no real danger! - The reality is, of course, slightly different!
