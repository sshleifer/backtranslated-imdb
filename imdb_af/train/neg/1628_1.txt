Without one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really seems to be really important. The tragic truth is that it is so completely worthless at every level that one cannot help but to laugh. In desperation for the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, it follows a city day in the wilderness ... they walk along a shady road, and everything is like a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of tarradiddle dialogue delivered here is ominous ("I feel that life itself is made up of so many small compartments like this pomegranate .... but is it so beautiful?") What looks like a eternity of absolutely nothing happens (well ... OK ... we are treated to a little nudity and a low soft sex scene), there is ultimately a very anti-climatic confrontation involving a few "Nam veterinarians taking the natural scene and perform some tough folk ballads With an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing exciting or interesting happens in this whole movie. I thought the Larry Buchanan photo "Strawberries should rain" was a bad example of a Bergman tribute. "Golden Apples" is every bit so bad, but the incessant random word it offers makes it memorably awful. 10/01
