The basic formula for the original series was; Take somebody, make the hearing about them, then put them in a death hazard. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now we're leaping forward 40 years after 2004. We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a little less than avid schoolchild, with his friend, Fermat, a young know-it-all. They are being sacked by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise where the Tracy family lives, for school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults are going to save John from Thunderbird 5. It was damaged by an accident. It's all part of The Hood's scheme to take over Tracy Island so he can steal the Thunderbird machines ... <br /> <br /> ?? To rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is so limp! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal, the acting more wood than that of the (fiberglass puppets), the effects, except special and Hans Zimmer's score ??? Little of Barry Gray's glorious theme shone through Zimmer's shining orchestra. The rest of the score was actually forgotten. In fact, part of the score was broadcast on the radio the following week and didn't recognize it! I didn't even bother to continue to prove Busted's mediocre efforts with the final titles <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked pretty well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope were wasted. With the right material, they could be show stoppers. The CGI work was what I would call the forefront - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main craft were just wrong; The original series models at least moved as if they had a mass. <br /> <br /> Another sore point is that the entire production seems to be one long set of product placements, from every vehicle built by Ford for the entire contents of The Tracy Freezer is produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son, 9, enjoyed the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and Clockstoppers, which was aimed at his age group, didn't add anything to the Thunderbirds legend. . When Star Trek hit 'The Motion Picture' in the big screen in 1979, a whole new lease of life has been built into the franchise which then continues for 20 years. With this film, Frakes missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, such as 'The Avengers' and 'the Saint', will sink in darkness within 6 months, leaving the original series in its 'classic' status.
