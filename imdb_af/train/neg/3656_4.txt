I have to admit that I have become a sucker for Samurai movie since I remember it. I rather looked unfairly, whether it was "elitist", like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comic book variation like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked America / Japanese "Crossovers" like The Bushido Leaves. And of course everything Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada contain. And I watched every Samurai almost at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I first watched Kabuto video, that even Samurai movies can be boring. In the beginning I was looking forward to Mayeda who had reached Europe and the confrontation that would come from it, but by the time he actually reached Spain, I really didn't care much about the movie. <br /> <br /> wouldn't do the film justice to call it bad. Technically, it's a clean entry into the genre. But there is simply never enough quiet. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as director and actor and has only a fraction of the above-mentioned Japanese actors charisma. And speaking of Sho Kosugis's son Kane, who appeared in almost all Sho Kosugi films as Shos's son: he inherited little of his fathers' limited acting skills. To add to the downsides is the absence of blood and gore that has been a trademark of all Samurai films so far. Of course, it was meant for a younger American / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it's a so-so movie for the average historical action adventure desire, but a drill for hardy fans of Samurai theater. Fans who meet in the Samurai? Genre should rather watch Red Sun (1971), with Charles Bronson as a cowboy working with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to join Alan Delon's samurai sword. That's pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> So, even if the movie is just 100 minutes, it looks like a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I gave it a fair 4/10 points instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I have to admit that his 'Engrish' is sometimes funny, but it's about 30 minutes.
