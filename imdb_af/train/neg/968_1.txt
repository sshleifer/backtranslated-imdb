An intriguing starting point of hand-drawn fantasy comes to life in a child's chorus dream. However, I imagine that the average non-fictional child is much more sensible to scare himself than Bernard Rose is to sound the viewer. The duel between Anna's two realities dragged too long to keep interest, especially since the girl she plays is the most abusive child actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just use for offense.
