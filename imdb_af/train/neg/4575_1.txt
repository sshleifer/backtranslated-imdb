I will admit that I am currently only a college student, an English major. By the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student. I want to say junior year, but maybe it was senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes a lot to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field, as well as any article I can find in Find and so on. I'm not a PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> It said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everyone is. My mom is such a person and since she has seen this movie, she has tried to get all her friends to see it and buy a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various bugs and problems I saw with the film logic and science - and they are numerous - and she declined my claims because "oh, such a high school student knows more than all the people with PhDs. "In this case, apparently so. <br /> <br /> The fact that a PhD is earned does not necessarily require a person to be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leave the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to expose half the film. If they leave it behind, the filmmakers have completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to appear supporting his beliefs when he was completely opposed. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think intuitor has done a very good job debunking the movie, feel free to read it if you do. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
