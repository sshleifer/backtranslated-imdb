Before commenting on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked it out was something I first saw on TV commercials in 1980: Barbara Bach's split. And since the movie received an R rating, I expected her to see her naked. Oh, no dice for her or the other beautiful actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, a teenager, but was actually 20 when she made it. Seeing her in a bra and tights and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as hurt as me. Bach. They offer some of the scattered laughs this movie offers. In fact, I don't give Ron Leibman that he got his name out of the credits, as his role as the stubborn Licensee is embarrassed, although I had the "temptation" scene he did with Mrs. Nelkin did. It also happens to be Ralph Macchio's debut, who is the loner among the misfits sent to an academic school. The other is a black child who loves his stepmother and me. Bach, an Arab who worships motor oil, and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin's character), dare to sneak in the middle of the night. in the girls' academy. Under the supporting film, Tom Poston plays a heavy character called Sisson, whom I have found partially amusing. With a screenplay by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and toward Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. arrives early in a soccer tournament), the Academy is unevenly with the politically wrong humor, but unless you really are It is actually a harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and his trademark cover boy Alfred E. Newman found guilty - even though they took their name and character off the picture. Ps Another of the "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my home town of Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
