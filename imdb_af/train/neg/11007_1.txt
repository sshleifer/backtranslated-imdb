Lately, they have been trying to hook up this movie late-night on cable TV ads. Don't believe the hype. I was one of the unfortunate people to see this stinker in theaters. It's in my opinion the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time, just behind Mac & Me (# 1 Worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I have to admit they are all close and all awful! Really, nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be, doesn't waste your money. The only thing that is good about it is your biggest enemy. I'm not lying about it. Someone you want to kill or torture will be a leading candidate for this movie. It's so terrible. If you don't believe me, you deserve it by the misery to look at it, which I doubt you can finish. Two Thumbs Enthusiastic.
