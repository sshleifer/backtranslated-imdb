This excuse for a movie is about nothing! Rachel Griffiths needs the money. The film has to be made on a very low budget because the lighting didn't exist. I made a vow if I ever see Pete Postlesumthingor see if I commit suicide. I would like to see if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is that I waste my time looking at this garbage.
