Look at the original with the same title from 1944! Made for TV movie, it's just god-horrible! Although it uses (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialogue, it just doesn't work! Is that the acting, the poor director? OK, it's made for TV, but why do you watch a bad copy if you can get your hands on the excellent original? Especially if you will be spoiled for the plot and will not enjoy the original as much as you first watched! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that differ from the original (it is shorter for once), but everything is even worse! The actors playing here don't fit the account! You just don't believe them and who can protrude Edward G. Robinson's original performance? If you want, just look after you have seen the original and even then you will be very brave if you look through it! It's almost declared holy!
