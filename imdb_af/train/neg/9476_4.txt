Pretty crazy whodunit with a whole black cast trying to figure out who killed the Philandering trumpet player. He just wanted to go to Hollywood to make it. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His will-be girlfriend? Her dad? His Butler? The newspaper man? Who knows? And who cares? The result is just a little bit of a hassle, and the actors here don't really get me a mood to find some way out. Why snake poison as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this one is good, but there is not much of it, and most of it is beautiful. Let's get it over with. It is not worth your time. There are better black-colored movies out there.
