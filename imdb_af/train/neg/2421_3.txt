With this ABC family effort of the hit, "cheaper by the dozen", a turbulent amount of wheat dialogue, shallow plot lines and cheese-like comebacks occur. With about two good actors among many will-be, this movie was a big disappointment. It's a Hollywood wannabe duo of an already bad plot. Then, because they needed many actors, it meant they would probably be more enjoyable. So the acting wasn't five-star. The plot was moving pretty fast, and the twists were bad and had horrible timing. The joining of characters and the "end relationships" was too soft and cut for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
