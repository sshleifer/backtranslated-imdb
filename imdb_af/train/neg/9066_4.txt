It focuses on unironic concepts of committing debt. <br /> <br /> Merrill boasts the betrayed boy to stop his murder over Rennie's death. Old-style real men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The crashing model airplane and car crash had to be impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The storytelling itself, despite the flashback sequence, plays it straight - all the narrators are trusted by us (regardless of the 'truth' or 'untruth' of the dialogue), so there is no game with the viewer over the narrative structure. It will be a rough template for future feedbacks, such as "Fearless". <br /> <br /> So all we have left is individual performance, and at that level it's best for Wynn's handling, a virtual one-man show.
