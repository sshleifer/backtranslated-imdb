I basically recorded this movie because I saw Kitano Takashi's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated Samurai story that also played Asano Tadanobu. These two movies are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and undermined traditional samurai movie clips. Gojoe goes down the other side. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies with other characters telling the audience what the main character is instead of the character being developed in the course of the movie. . "You can't decide whether you're a monk or a fighter" says almost every character in Benkei's presence, but this inner unrest is scarcely transmitted within the character itself. Instead of character development, we become inflated, boring, fighting battles. Asano's character is undeveloped and even he seems bored and does not know what he is doing there. I know he usually looks distant and cool and it is part of Asano's appeal, but this movie doesn't serve him. <br /> <br /> Many of the camera's movements are misleading. There is a scene that lasts forever, turning the camera around the main characters until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The end is ridiculous and rather anti-climate. <br /> <br /> It is too bad that really good samurai movies are not made in Japan with this type of budget today. The colors, scenery and costumes were great, but the rest is just a nice waste of time. I'd rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
