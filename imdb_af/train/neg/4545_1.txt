This wonderful merger of New Age chatter and sly bad movies may not open up to borrowing one of the movie's favorite verbs, but it can lower your jaw and hurt or laugh your stomach. Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, the first (self) published in 1993, this watch of kitsch follows the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) traveling to the deepest, darkest, finest Peru and also sniff the air or something else illegal. On behalf of which he was discovered, a shock Shangri La is populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavy medications, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a panpipe thrive and sometimes from a heavenly choir. Although there is much talk of "energy", the quality is certainly lacking in the moderate role, of which Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, are all nailed into the campsite. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorist and Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni gave the wrong direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the screenplay of a screenplay. In short, the worst movie easily seen in 40+ years of reading movies.
