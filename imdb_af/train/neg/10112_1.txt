Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including very low-budget amateur straight-to-DVD horrors that no-one would ever want to see in their right mind. I saw thousands of movies in my time, very excellent, very forgetful. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly horror horror movies I've ever seen? In fact, I still haven't recovered from the experience of viewing it. <br /> <br /> The next day it looks like this is a strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work from a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' movie, and I won't recommend it as 'bad'. But if you're entertained by the prospect of probably watching the most unconditionally mutilated movie ever? it's for you. Now, when someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen is, I'll tell the Zombie nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think it's a bigger crime to make a boring movie a bad one, and Ulli Lommel earns credit for producing a movie that actually pushes you with its incompetence. He is really the Ed Wood Jr. from the digital era, and I can't wait to see if he makes another movie as consistently ridiculous as this one.
