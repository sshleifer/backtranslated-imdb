Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy (or something) masculine masculinity and continues to present film history at a acting college led by cowardly John Huston (don't ask) and a young, happy couple (young, attractive, young Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes the Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that was unmovable and of course trying to film it. They also hired an English man with a definite anti-American attitude and hired a lot of actors with a dubious "talent" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West) everything together and .... SORPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie received an X rating when it was released (it was lowered to an R), mostly due to a really tasteless scene in which Welch Rusty (Roger Herren) sodomized and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very scattershot ... scenes jumping all over the place and people say and do things that don't make sense. It is not good at all, but I was never bored. <br /> <br /> Acting varies wild ... Reed is terrible ... very sad. Huston repeatedly chews the landscape and again with a fascinating extreme. Welch isn't really bad like Myra, but her lines don't make sense, so you never know what to do about her. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really sick to hear a woman who is nearly 80 years old. Roger Herren (whatever happened ...) was very young, beautiful and not bad like Rusty. Fawcett is OK. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say things about it ... you just look at it in disbelief. A must see movie - to believe !!!!
