I am a keen B-Rate horror movie buff and have seen my fair share of slasher photos, so I have a significant measure to judge this movie. It is easily found in the top echelon of the worst horror movies the 1980s offers. It's not as scary as the Demons Night, it's not as stingy as Re-Animator and has the camp value of There's nothing out there. That being said, this movie has no value. Keep in mind, the movie is for a completely different movie. The stills shots on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ (There is a lot of violence, but we've seen it before. A killer kills nubile students and the chambers by knocking the throat and all the other tired methods of murder that horror movies used.) <br /> <br /> NEWS: None <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who changed her name to Forbes Riley after this movie was made - accepting a work education at a university People start dying and Forbes thinks the murderer directs her Is it her new sadness with a checkered past or Libido crazy student To be honest, it is impossible to make sure the writing does not protrude any character outside Forbes. <br /> <br /> WARNING: $ (Terrible at all levels. feels like a school production - high school, because college students can make a better movie than that. Forbes show a talent talent like Seminara as one of the students, but all are of the "extras" caliber of acting).
