OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I am demographic in the old age, and I identify similar to some of the stories. Even the sometimes tough and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and would be forgiven in another movie. <br /> <br /> I'm trying as hard as possible to have this movie too dirty like the others, but it's not as easy as the movie makers haven't tried at all. <br /> <br /> Editing in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not have to go to the film school to learn, lean good editing is not one of them, but the identification of a bad one is. <br /> <br /> Also the shot ... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but sometimes we see random things popping up, and with the editing, this will give you the most painful movie show experience. <br /> <br /> This movie is made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is also no excuse. I watched short movies on YouTube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know how good you think, but this movie is nothing more than a masturbation of your egos. You must be ashamed of yourself! Finally, this movie is like a very lazy amateur porn movie if it is filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If it's not your kind of thing, avoid it at all costs!
