I rented it in the 80's and can't really remember what is specifically about the movie - just being the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not one of the "it was so bad, it was funny". It's none of the "it was so nice, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movies. It wasn't even one of the "what was it?" movies. I can't remember the performances of the actors, but it was shot poorly, the story was incompatible, and it had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted time. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of movies I didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and / or storytelling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. The incubator has no one. <br /> <br /> I actually intended NOT to make a comment on this "piece" because I'm afraid someone might see it out of curiosity, but I'm obliged to warn someone who appreciates film skip this movie. .
