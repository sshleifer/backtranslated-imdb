Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel he has sold out to get his first major lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple. They all saw their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black men who commit good crimes are a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Well, I laughed a few times and said that all these comedians are still picking up hilarious roles, but I'd love to branch out to see all Marlon Wayans depiction in Requiem's ​​dream. Whether in Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans, appearances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
