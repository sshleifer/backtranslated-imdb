I wrote a review of this movie after I bought it on DVD and was very dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> I tried to look again after reading some of the comments that have been read since then. Being a film student and making similarly budgeted movies myself (ie no budget, shot on digi cam), I stand by my original comment. It's not a budget student project (and not a very good one), which is released on video / DVD to watch an award-winning movie (if you read the cover). So the public cheats to think it's something it isn't. I want my money back in the trade description! Complete Rubbish!
