Antonioni's movies didn't look good. What has always surprised me is that there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of the characters and situations, besides an indisputable plastic beauty. For example, remember the talks between Mastroianni and the "bad capitalist" who want to sing him in "La Notte", or Monica Vitti to the farmers who are in the train in "La aventura" flute, or Ferzetti drop the glass ink the same movie. <br /> <br /> I checked "Zabriskie Point" yesterday. In this movie there are many beautiful and extensive shots of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of LA, the publicity advertisements, the deserts, etc. That shows the fascination of the writer in his American journey. way as Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-left cliches that spoil the film: - The boy leaves the assembly, steals a plane and flies over the desert to free himself and find something else. - The drivers in gray suites always talk about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the pool and leaves because she doesn't want to be like them. - The few fat middle class in the caravan speak, before the beauty of nature, to build a hotel and earn a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples love in the desert. What a hippie platitude! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "La Aventura" we can see that the king is naked and his films (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il Grido" ) is only a handful of aesthetic and common places.
