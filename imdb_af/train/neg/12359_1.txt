I thought it was a really horrible movie - I actually yelled at my TV several times. One or both of the gay-masculine leads were ignored; There was absolutely no chemistry between them, and Richard Ruccolo seemed to rather kiss a dog. The film covers their long and tortured courtesy, which highlights every trade-off and make-up, but does not develop the details in any detail. These reasons will make for some interesting characters, not the battle or the makeup scene in bed (even if you like the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but it doesn't make the movie worth renting. Save your money.
