It is incredible to me that goes for entertainment today. Maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties, and I'm out of touch with the current movie generation, and that's apparently the case with this movie, as so many people loved it. I found it dirty and vulgar. I didn't say much about movies in my life, but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and rude. I'm not a politically correct person, and even the gay jokes, not just funny but straightforward (I'm not gay). The main character in the movie is not even a nice person, just pathetic. When the movie was over, I heard a number of people commenting on how disappointed they were in what they just paid to see.
