Expectations were somewhat high for me when I watched this movie, I thought Steve Carell could not be wrong, with a movie like Anchorman, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I'm starting out right with this movie: Steve Carell may be Steve Carell at some points. There are a handful of moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it's almost entirely due to the fact that he got the wrap room to do his thing. He is an undoubtedly talented individual, and it is a pity that he signed on, which in my opinion was a total train swing. <br /> <br /> With that out of the way, I'll discuss what went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Dan Burns, a three-girl widower who is considered for a nationally syndicated advisory column. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his long family meets. <br /> <br /> The family is high above the list of things that make it a terrible movie. No family behaves like this. It's almost as if they were moved from Pleasantville or left to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think is a family when we are 7. It reaches the point where they become stupid and just frustrating. Get soccer, crossword puzzles, family bowling, and talent shows are NOT HOW REAL PEOPLE PRAY. It's almost sick. <br /> <br /> Another big mistake is the woman Carell falls. Seeing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is looking at a stroke victim who is trying to be rehabilitated. What I mean is supposed to be unique and original. This woman comes so softly delayed. <br /> <br /> It makes me think this movie is happening on another planet. I left the theater and wondered what I just saw. After thinking further, I don't think it was much.
