I'm a Shakespeare fan, and I appreciate what Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of viewers. However, this movie does not fall into the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences. Add it with Alicia Silverstone's stumbling block dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in many Ado About Nothing) and other poor roles, all of which resemble a turbulent endurance.
