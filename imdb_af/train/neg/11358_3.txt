When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and it was on a 4-D attraction (you know the attraction the seats are moving). I assume that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min) and was also made to add the movement effects. It was a cute movie ... but it was. It was educational and telling of the first mission, but the end of a CGI space station was a bit ... well ... trite. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to any parent who wants to inform their children in a fun way about the first moon walker. I would say the character actors were well-chosen and the characters themselves were cute. So all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring the younger children ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
