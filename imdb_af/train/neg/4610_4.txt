I watched this movie because I realized it had Kari Wuhrer in the movie. I have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but it never seems to prove, as she is always in such a low budget B movie. She is still pretty, and she still tries to act on the unfortunate material I always see her. It is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it doesn't make it good. George Wendt played against kind, and it was so bad that he was recognized for his role. Another note about me. Wuhrer. Her breasts have shrunk considerably since I last saw her. Perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. It's not a bad thing. She still looks good. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
