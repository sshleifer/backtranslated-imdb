Yes, it just makes it. This movie was terrible. Two minutes later I wanted to stretch my eyes. It's praised as an "innovative LDS comedy," but it's not even good for members of that church! I don't think anyone should be so victimized as watching a movie of this low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can't call it any trouble at all. The horrible horror, glib, trite plot seems to have been thrown together by two mad weasels somehow with the gift of coherent (at least semi-coherent) thoughts. Then there is the acting, which is a pity of * everyone * involved. Even the cameos fail to generate anything. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget that our protagonist is a level that we believe might change, but the road is full of terrifying bad dialogue, terribly frightening "gags" and many Mormons. "that anyone in their right minds, LDS or not, should purely * consider stupid *! It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
