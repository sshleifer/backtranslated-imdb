It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events in it are completely random and make little or no sense. The fact that there is a successor is so ugly that I can come up with a case of cabin fever (I AM SO SORRY). I describe it as a mistake stifled by a newspaper, because it seems to be different parts of things that are mixed. For example, Kevin, the pancake loves karate child, is just terribly strange on its own, then there is the policeman who is a little strange and confused, then the drug addict, then the fact that they attack a random man who is helping need it. then suddenly the main character is sex with his girlfriend, just because she says something dumb about an airplane crashing. Then there is a good old family racism followed by a rabbit who works on Kevin's karate child. It's actually extremely despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, even that didn't make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word, but since it is the only word I have allowed to use it will have to. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
