Georgia Rule must be one - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that makes me sting, "what?" aloud at least 7-10 times throughout his bad two hour course. <br /> <br /> In his trailer as a movie over three generations of women - Jane Fonda as the matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious, overarching, cute little granddaughter, the viewer believes this will be a clich√©, light, chick fly to grow up and come together as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising thereby worst. <br /> <br /> After many shots of animals, "funny" things are in the background of "rotating" scenes and not to mention a full five minutes, focusing on an old woman in a doctor's office comes weekly to change her diaper, or the fact that this movie is about the character of Lindsay Lohan's sexual abuse by her stepfather creates Georgia Rule's own genre of the movie: The Unfounded, Terrible Act, Inappropriate Comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most uncomfortable, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, he had to watch The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. June bug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that the Georgia rule is is to create a hypothetical situation. Say the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about to be celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of the movie taking a more dramatic turn, stomach and comedy will act. All the characters' reactions are those of fake, lifeless people who pretend to care. <br /> <br /> Throw a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney, as the flatest, most non-dimensional character that can be completely cut off from this poorly written writing, along with a masculine character that casts all his religions into convictions. morals to be with a trashy, brown-colored girl who doesn't share the same interests as him, as well as an unnecessary car-hunting scene, unreal moments of interrelated characters, and you have Georgia rule. <br /> <br /> I found this movie an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling with filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc. Who has much more talent and does not get noticed. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie: my line. <br /> <br /> And if you have to, you get enough drunk beforehand.
