The day finally came to see the survival of Azumi's fate as an assassin, the character of her character and the ultimate attempt to move deeper into the world, she became so merciless during the first saga . <br /> <br /> It is as denser as I will get when I talk about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I got over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about Aya's credibility Ueto, depicting a blood-driven killer, after watching Azumi 2 I greeted the aforementioned shortcomings more than ever before. <br /> <br /> Not only is the determination of each killer slow and uninspiring, but also very important elements are omitted from the whole experience. In Azumi 1 we saw that the assassins use different stealth tactics (which are their first priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their points with quick retrenchments and faster escaping abilities. But I will not like this movie too much, as this story is slightly tweaked this time and even more obstacles are planted in Azumi's plant to prevent her from reaching the shepherd and showing any signs of charisma. Incidentally, Chiaki is foolish for most of the movie, basically playing a finished version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and the sense of threat. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final blow that is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising opponents with flashy looks and even flickering weapons. No one's surprise meets them in one way or another, but the movie falls short when each of them starts to die too fast and too fast. In Azumi 1, the young killers were usually overwhelmed by the opposition with fast but somewhat satisfying battles and the final confrontation between Azumi and Bijomaru compared to the fighting in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects have been launched, but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the briefness of each meeting. I can't take the conventional style of samurai movies with their fast and realistic struggle, but characters in both Azumi movies were so imaginative and straightforward that the rules could be broken and the action further enriched. <br /> <br /> The romance side of Azumi is there to fill time between battles. Unfortunately, in the end, it serves nothing but a necessary solution. <br /> <br /> As a fan with an open mind for a wide variety of movies and animations, I will not lie and I will admit that I have my neutrality and infinity towards the first Azumi movie, but I will act upright and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what it is worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love may have gone straight to the video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to expand or even expand on the turbulent journey of desperate killers. They did their best to restore peace. unwavering courage to try.
