It may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole half an hour from my life, and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny about 10 minutes. His loud spoken voice and crazy flailing are getting old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into a long line of former SNLs who have been trying to film. Some are brilliant, some have failed. There is not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then okay, and not so funny, and then dead ... so I suppose he hit the whole spectrum in one career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague. </ br /> <br /> c
