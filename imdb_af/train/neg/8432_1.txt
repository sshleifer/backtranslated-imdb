Let it be to geniuses such as Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the higher action in his country to subsidize this deceptive attempt of a movie. The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product to try to make a film out of such a thin material. Most of the photos made in Spain fall into two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War, which viewed history as written. The other types of movies show the viewer with lots of free sex because the 'creators' are not interested in saying anything. <br /> <br /> As the film opens, we get Pere's penis while trying to cut it down and put it in one of the stickers at a party. Later, Sandra will show what she has been given to the audience to admire. The story of Pere's appeal to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happy, is false from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the movie centered on an earlier, better-made photo by Mr. Punch, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the mess we punished to look at this business. Regarding the comments in IMDb, all the negative voices come from Spanish viewers talking volumes out of them!
