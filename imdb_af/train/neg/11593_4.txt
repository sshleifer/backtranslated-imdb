I see this movie as one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I couldn't remember a thing, 20 minutes after the movie was over, it even carried me a review. <br /> <br /> Well, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joke. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is basically a good thing. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add tension and horror. Because of that nightmare 5: the dream child is not funny, or is it scary. What we actually get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (perhaps with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). The plot (Freddy who killed Lisa's friends using Lisa's unborn child's dreams) has a good base, but it's just not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (maybe because there isn't any) and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers have. The script had more holes than Swiss cheese and the movie was very cheesy. (Let me say I don't like cheese, even if I come from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4. <br /> <br /> Don't bother to rent / buy this movie if it's not for completeness, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 is also a messy one ...)
