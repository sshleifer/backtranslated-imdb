Herculis Puaro is generally an established 'hero' who knows us well about books and movies. This movie or this story doesn't work and I feel it's not Agatha's fault. The actors are not good, the actors are exaggerated and foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and neat that everything (even Arabian clothes) looks fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro does a good job, but nothing great. The screens are, as said before, perfect and look fake. The story is not very enchanting, although it is a mystery of murder, but caring for the death of a profitable and unholy 45 + blonde blonde in the Iraqi desert?! The "victim" is not nice.
