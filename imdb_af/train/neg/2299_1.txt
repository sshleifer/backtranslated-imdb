Before I start ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and in hell. Kay now, this is out of the way, I just want to say: What in the world do these morals who call themselves "hosts" think they do? The last time I reviewed a host, did not discriminate, did not hate hasty rations on television, or tried to put their own beliefs on every unfortunate soul daring on the channel. All this crazy, idiot, conservative, belligerent, Fred Phelps lover, Pat Robertson, does daily. I'm all for freedom of speech, but since when has it covered a man who pretty much says that if you venture out of his ideal way of life, you're immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of SOOO many problems. One day in my classroom we had a substitute teacher, and we decided to watch TV as education didn't give us a job. And we (to many of us) watched the 700's club, and of course the jerk Pat was ranting and overpowering the Bible. And Simon said, "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard a child. go "Hmm I think he's right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a great sin, they should take the host seriously, take down their bandits and leave them in the middle of the Arctic.
