I have never seen much of the "student" when it comes to watching movies, I look at them, form an opinion and that's it. But Unhinged changed it all. This film is without a doubt the most relentless attempt to make a movie I have ever seen. Every child who stinks at the university thinks they are going to be the next Spielberg or Tarantino, this movie should be handed over with a handbook titled "How not to make a movie". Not only is there no story to have, the filmmakers were not even capable of making a movie worth watching. It was a while since I saw it, but all I can say is to see the overhead shots in the opening images. They never end! It's almost like pulling your teeth, just not so much fun.
