This movie was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama during the Independent War. It has memories of "Dances With Wolves" for the big prairies, Indians, military battles and of "Barry Lyndon" for the British and candles lightly atmospheres ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the writing is terrible: the continuity missing from the story (cut "5 months later"; "3 years later") and the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it: America is a big country, but the characters bumped together; Above all, wait for the end and you understand how to kill a story (think the same in "Titanic"). Sometimes a brilliant filmmaker saves a bad manuscript. Unfortunately bis, Hudson is a poor one. He has already committed Greystoke and I find the same mistakes again: no dynamic in scenes, in editing, in scoring: it's long, boring, flat .... <br /> <br /> I knew this movie was a disaster for Pacino's career: now I understand. Finally, this last movie for 2006 is for me this year this year: a painful one ...
