I saw every episode of this spin. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of such success, which is Gray's Anatomy. So I continued to look. I'm afraid the second season doesn't have the charm, chemistry and more importantly the drama of his predecessor Gray's Anatomy. The relationships seem confronted and the acting is so-so. The script lacks the intelligence and comic hints seen in GA. It has been shown that a formal but not formal and confronted feel, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.
