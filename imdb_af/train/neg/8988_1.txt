So far, the worst movie I've ever seen, Ben & Arthur. You really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one. The review statistics for this movie are positively skewed by a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it, evidence that is fairly easy to uncover online. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were honorable enough to leave it on its own shaky legs, instead of promoting it so willingly, that suckers like me would buy it. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music ... what's more in a movie? Whatever it is, here it is as bad as it gets. If it wasn't that unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I kept looking and thinking it should get better, because I haven't discovered that one of the positive reviews is reliable. <br /> <br /> Making a good movie doesn't cost a lot of money, nor does a low budget mean a movie should be bad. My favorite example of a spectacular budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant's wonderful Mala Noche, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets ?? Director's Track or Original ?? is bad because the people who made it had no money, but because they had great egos and had no talent for anything but self-promotion.
