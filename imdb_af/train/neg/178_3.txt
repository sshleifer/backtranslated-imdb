This movie is made-for-TV, so I take it into account, I'm not going as hard as I want a movie. The script is sub-par, but it manages to be lightly humorous in places, or so or not. The acting is mostly over, but it applies to many lower-budget movies. <br /> <br /> However, the aspect of this movie I really hated was that 90-95% of it was shot on film, but in random places there would be 5-10 seconds of video footage being shot. You can see because there is less contrast, the colors are less bright and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of the film's 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if these screens would have to be shot later and at the time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (that's why, anyway) but disoriented and really made the movie cleaner. as it had to look. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I definitely saw worse movies, but I definitely won't say I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend anyone to see it.
