City girl Meg Tilly receives a terrible call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns to her family's rural digs, just to be mysterious: why are all the householders in bizarre and disturbing ways? Radiant driller, with barely a nod to ecology, has berserked residents of small towns, who (laughing) publicly enter two women with a desire in a public place and Tim Matheson's oral attention from a girl at get office bank. The picture is too foolish for words, wasting Tilly's voluptuousness and silent intensity on garbage, forcing himself into a corner, can't possibly come out. Some of the movie art by Thomas Del Ruth is good (especially a fire set in a garage), though dropped by the tough editing - and a pretty badetic final. Simple script has no surprise or a pinch of originality anywhere. * 1/2 of ****
