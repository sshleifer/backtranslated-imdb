This film is actually just Bill Maher's interpretation of religion. There are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but not in the light of an even-handed discussion of religion. This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary. Everything is arranged before the time and in editing to give the opinion of the director rather than making your own decision. <br /> <br /> EDITING - It is very clipped, inter-split with clips of pop culture and the media to strengthen the point. The interviewer hardly had a chance to complete a sentence before being interrupted by the editing. The only people who have a fair chance to speak their minds are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. As soon as someone according to Maher deviates from the gospel, they are being edited. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWS - They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From TV evangelicals to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to a TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously a TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He chose the worst money grabs, the heavy extremists, and those who didn't have the budget to say no to pick up. And when he gets a good person to support, he changes the hell out of them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Especially difficult hit are the Muslims. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the chance to talk before he or she interrupts himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombings. ALL Muslims are depicted as extrasists by editing. None of the people questioned are being reasonably worked. ENDING - The message at the end is incredibly heavy-handed and while it's interesting. idea, it is not fair to the many people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while cuts of destruction are playing in the foreground. It literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the movie flaws it has good points, and the humor, while very unfair, is actually funny. But know this, it's a very one-sided view, Bill Maher's view of religion. He discovers nothing. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - A few good moments, but heavy-handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
