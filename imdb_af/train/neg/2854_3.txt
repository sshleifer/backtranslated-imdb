Dreyfuss plays a plow boss who has lost his head, but now he is "stuck." Lane is his girlfriend who breaks around with his number one (Goldblum), who is going to do something with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone can consider an all-star supporting role (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor), this plot can't help, as Dreyfuss proves he not "stuck" and trying to kill just about everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, it's not like you didn't know what was there. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys who wanted to tell Goldblum what was available to him when Dreyfuss came out, but I will save you all the trouble. Skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason I picked This movie is because I've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and tried to see all her movies. The actual download place for me was not just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she didn't appear until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear from her through the movie). Even a fan of more than half of the cast can't help me enjoy this movie. The parts where the tension was supposed to store made me laugh at what was actually going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
