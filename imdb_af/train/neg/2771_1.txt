The movie had to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed. <br /> <br /> Apparently the story writer just doesn't hold water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion, people should have a reason why they view it differently from historical views on the past. The accuracy of history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film has no substance at all. The only way to fix this movie is somehow a legend rather than just a story. And a legend will have some elements that tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. This is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie fails to answer, why would I see it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some weird legendary Flying Elephants, psychic king or eccentric king like "The King and I" would have been nice, something would have added a lot to the movie's appeal. I think there was no appeal other than an ordinary vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you have the appeal, the story is the next thing we focus on. In marketing terms, we call it "must see". At the trial of the title of the movie, people would say: Oh, I have to see it. Now where's the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just repeat the title and call it "How not to be a king?" and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days, according to the style of Dr. Strangelove. It would have been much more interesting. Narrative experiences of the predecessors of the King of the first persons made the film very funny. <br /> <br /> Today, most movies call to see, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they don't have familiar characters, some other movies like The Island had an appeal themselves when the ad asked, "Do you still believe there is an island?" <br /> <br /> For the movie, "How NOT to be a King", the question may be asked, "So you want to be another king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
