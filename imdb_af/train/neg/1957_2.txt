I enjoyed the movie most of the time, but I still got the feeling that I was watching a children's movie. I honestly think someone wrote a pg script and then decided to add blood, nudity and language during the filming. it was a great debauchery. There is apparently the children's magic that exists in movies such as "babe" (the pig) or "angels abroad" who defeat the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up with their daughter's ability to see the ghost and use this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie response to the terrible darkness falling; somehow managed to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they didn't. they made a worse movie and would probably lose the same share of money lost on the dark fall.
