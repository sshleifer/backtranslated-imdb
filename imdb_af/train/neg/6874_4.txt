Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) directed and interpreted this strange film, which is the second installment of a kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I don't think this movie's part of the Dogma'95 manifesto, even though it really looks like that. I'm not really sure what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They perform fairly well, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I don't know, there's something about the movie I don't like. The sex scene is far too long. It's from an interesting artwork to an erotic piece of crap. I don't know exactly where it stands. Sure it's not a bad movie, but I won't suggest people to see it, nor will I let them know. Do as you please. If you are curious, and you are open-minded, try it, you may like it.
