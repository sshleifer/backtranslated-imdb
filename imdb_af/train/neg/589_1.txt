Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but because it is here in Luxembourg 17 and a movie should be really brutal or pornographic in this category. Believe me I'm a movie freak, I've seen a lot of brutal movies in my lifetime (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply stupid, directing is terrible, acting was mediocre, even the music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some of the screens are really hard to stand. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and the baby is crying - terrible). I can't understand why the film in Germany was rated 16, where the criteria are usually equally harsh (eg a cruelty, but it has made fun of itself and has a big role in the Asian cinema and a wonderful direction). Similar state of grace is rated 18). No one can call it a horror movie because it was actually more to watch than to scare the public. (The "Creep's" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); to me (excuse my expression) it is just one crazy director who lives out his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence, which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, and also doesn't explain anything. The plot has holes and bugs, the dialogue is boring. Honestly I can't name a single positive aspect of the movie, except for the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would ban this movie from the theaters. I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to getting feedback on my thread and I'll be happy to discuss one or the other topic. <br /> <br /> "Livin 'the dream baby, living the dream" David Aames
