Where to start ... Oh yeah, Message to the bad guys: Once you testify the person you've found (to kill) a crime you've committed, don't spend time talking to her so she didn't have another opportunity to get away. Message to the victim: When the thugs speak and argue among themselves, use the opportunity to "AWAY AWAY", do not sit there and watch until they make a noise they hear. Message to the Director: If someone starts a 5 or 10 minute head in a vehicle or on foot, you can't immediately have the bad guys on their heels or bumper! time and movement do not work like that. It would also be nice to think that a woman should not (4) kill men cruelly to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home.
