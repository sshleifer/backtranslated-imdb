How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the real movie for her ... too bad, she's totally out of role. I didn't read the book by Jane Austen, but I can't believe it is so superficial and the characters are not much more than caricatures. It was probably not easy to reduce about 600 pages of the book in about two hours, but I expected more than just old furniture and tea cups. Every time I saw an actor who overshooted a few times, I took a sigh of relief.
