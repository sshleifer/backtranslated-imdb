The remake of H.B. Halicki's classic seventy-year film is simply awful. Along with the vanishing point, in 60 seconds, it left the distinctive motoring films. The remake takes the original and puts it on its head. While Halicki drives our 75% car and 25% support drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% car hunt and 75% support drama. Cage as superman, save his brother, kiss the girl. MTV changes, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least, Halicki did not see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed, and played in the 74-movie) in this way.
