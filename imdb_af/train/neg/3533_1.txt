Let this movie serve as the slap to the "big turn" movies produced from the 1990s. This spectacular light hand is known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, and has been killed to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation in a BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Madonna"), the Soze motif uses a much more obsequious way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with highly dubious hair hair) stars as Jack Green (known to everyone as "Green.") He may or may not Or maybe Mr. Gold an irritated spirit who can own the underworld. I'm not quite sure, but I don't care. REVOLVER is one of the most overriding examples of film surplus. I have long had the displeasure to endure. Testify of the broken time structure, the painful jerks, the incessant inner monologues, and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This "everything and the kitchen sink" makes straight style Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre looks soft. The movie and mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was so bored to tell this striking story while I saw it. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments of revelation that is thought to be shocking, but they come just like news to Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green, because I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone. Here, however, he struggles like a remedial reader in a university of English literature. His lack of whiteness is only consistent with the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Spit on scenery like a hungry man on a smorgasbord, spit, scream, and steam through the movie in an embarrassment of staggering and leopard printers. <br /> <br /> There are no reasoning properties for REVOLVER. This is another cinematic faux pas from Ritchie and can still be his worst remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie yet.
