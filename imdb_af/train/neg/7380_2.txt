I think his time for Seagal is quiet at night. What I've seen has made him known directly to the videos in recent years, resembling his early 90's smash hits. <br /> <br /> A secret bio lab creates a new kind of drug that makes one's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow, Seagal has to stop the infection or end the world ... or something. Seagal also went through hits like jelly beans. Every time I looked up, he was recommending a new face, so it also became difficult to follow character development. Steven's athsma prevents him from screaming at the top of his lungs. He is constantly baptized by people who don't sound like him? Usually, the plot's plot and action sequences can save it from a total waste of time, but it wasn't even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie with lots of blood and pound rather than fighting straight. The problem was it wasn't a pity and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have a speed of light movement, but the 40-year-old 280lb Seagal killed them all alone? I think the one-time highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits asked Seagal to come to the comic club. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
