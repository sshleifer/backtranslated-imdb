This movie was the most beautiful Mormon movie ever made. It has the RM & Sons or Provo looks like well done movies! It was supposed to be funny about what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the film Travis Eberhard. If he wasn't in the movie, it probably wouldn't be made! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It wasn't funny 9. It was a knock 8. It had Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character had no sense. 7. It was made in Provo 6. It didn't make fun with Brokeback 5. It did Larry H. Miller in it 4. It was 1st movie Clint Howard wasn't funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 as a return 2. They had to go to Surreal Life auditions 1. It's made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
