No words can describe my total hatred for this horrible version of the BTK killer. Rate this movie one in ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a movie. There wasn't a single highlight from start to finish. The whole thing was terribly composed; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, VERB, factual information, ACTIVE, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-hard-funny, for the horrific way the whole thing is composed. This review may seem like an unfair and fearless attack on a low-budget movie, but that's not the case. Just think of the movie I just saw, start cooking my blood. How this movie ever received rights for production I will NEVER know. I'm almost requested to actually recommend BTK because it's really a stance on how pathetic and disturbing it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of filming, it's the WORST. MOVIE. Ever. I wasted about this useless garbage over an hour of my life, and would have liked to jump from the nearest building, if I know what I was for. Zero out of ten.
