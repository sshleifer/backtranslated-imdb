Usually when I attack the local Hollywood Video I head to the B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principals behind a B-Horror movie are the camp value, Heavy Gore, Many Unnecessary Nudity, and special effects that anyone can bring with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I was a fan of the band since they released their first Demo in 1995. The movie started on an interesting note and when I saw Dani Filth hit a very obvious latex mask, I laughed. When I saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene, I was even more successful. I pretty much laughed at the whole movie and when I didn't laugh, I shook my head and remembered how a multi-million dollar rock star would like to make a movie that looks like a hundred-dollar budget was. . The whole point of this movie was for me the "Hardcore Goth children who think of death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan, are the biggest things found out since Lava lamps. It was really that. For me, this movie was 80 , 5% of things that happened in this movie just happened because it was satanic, this movie had a lot of potential and could really be a good movie, but ultimately this "Movie" is really just an extended Cradle or Filth Video.
