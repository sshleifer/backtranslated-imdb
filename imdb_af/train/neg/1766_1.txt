Baldwin really bent down to make such movies. The disc, the music, everything in this movie, is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The sound FX doesn't really sound like they are out of their way (technical gadgets, etc.) If they try to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get it really and let those extra beeps and beeps, because the gadgets don't make really loud sounds. Of course, sounds like footprints, and it doesn't exist, giving it a void atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Directing seems to be good for such a low budget movie (I hope it was a low budget production), although it seems almost amateurish. <br /> <br /> Most characters look nice and fake, they haven't thrown this movie very well. I think it would be a better idea to have Baldwin speak Spanish than to let Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that they are the language that is more vibrant and vibrant, and that is why the actors' performance can suffer. is largely used as a foreign language. I mean, can anyone finally realize how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? It must have been buried a long time ago in film production. The production team has ever heard of captions? This film again controls European police as lazy and corrupt, the societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean if the plot goes back like: "The Interpol can't do jack, so let's call one American to bring down this international syndicate" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures tread on the same path as Columbia before It just makes movies for hell of it. I can imagine them having self-respect. Buyers have to buy every dirty title just because Sony brings something good a few times a year? Maybe they should have used the same team as Di Que Si - I say do. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan. Do a decent job of keeping the movie. Look and sound much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
