Unfortunately, it's not "the best British gore movie since hellraiser," although the DVD cover claims it bought me to buy it. However, it is a tribute to many of the great horrors of the old, films of especially the Amicus stable. <br /> <br /> Cradle is shot on mini dv, which although we all know more about a TV feeling than a movie, can be done so much better. Each scene, set and shot looks as if it is illuminated in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear), which only enhances the cheap look of the final piece. The gore content is honest, laughing. From the opening shots where we see a man's obvious foam head, cut apart, through smaller inexpensive ram hammers, the creature effects and the terrible cg, there was nothing that impressed me absolutely. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible, from the nearby detective to the hummingbird, via Dani Filth, the least convincing horror movie bad guy I've ever seen. Each of the sub-stories is more formative than the last, and the sets are getting worse and worse than the movie. Look out for the 'Spiritual Asylum' - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad CG sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) stuffed cell I saw. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to get to the end of the movie, without throwing my attention at any available opportunity (no, running). I actually bumped myself at one point while the movie was running. <br /> <br /> It does notice one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I think is one (about two) things it is about. I have ever heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I would like to believe them, but this evidence is unlikely. to. If you want a decent tribute to Amicus, avoid it and rather go into the League of Gentlemen Christmas Specialist. <br /> <br /> Currently playing with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I have. ever seen.
