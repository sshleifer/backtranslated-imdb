Assuming that this would not be a live-to-video release, I would have to destroy this title at all costs. Unless you are bored with good, well-executed movies, it is. I saw AFI Dallas last night, and I stayed for 20 minutes just because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not the offense of the director ... it's uncomfortable). If you can only see 5 minutes in the movie (a shot out, a broken window before any shots are fired ... and then break the window with the first shot), things go bad. Let's just say that this is just an indication of the things that come ... unhappy. <br /> <br /> I'll save you all the details, but it's in every way, even the half-bag by Michael Madsen is disappointing if you expect him to act half-assed of him. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. NOW. <br /> <br /> 3/10
