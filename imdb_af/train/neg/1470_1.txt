I watched our DVD tower last night for something to watch. We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I took out one I had never heard before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket it sounded like a rip-off from The Big Chill, but with the all-cast cast it felt worth watching. Boy was I wrong !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill", it was a ripe-almost character per character. The Bill Paxton character was a copy of William Hurt ("where were you all this time role") - spoiler warning - and look behind him to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Jerk Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc. I found myself watching these people even. There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" even find these characters after 20 years? Plus it wasn't even funny, except when Perkins had fallen out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife, "Were there any intimate characters in this movie? Are you sleeping there?" She replied, "No, I still think ... No, no one I can think of."
