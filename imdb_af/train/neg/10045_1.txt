All the world said the movie Tashan would be a great fun, but that is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake as an actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable through the film. Her tom boy didn't really look good. Even the movie is not the story of the movie at all. Everyone said India's Quetin Taratino is Vijay, but it's not Quetin at all. The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this silly movie. Anil is a great caliber actor and this film is not. Akshay Kumar is also a victim of this movie because it is Saif. The style and the Phoormola are not really good in this movie, but I was disappointed
