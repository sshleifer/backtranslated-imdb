I'm a big fan of 50's sci-fi, but it's not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teenager sci-fi movie, the director counted too heavily on the movie. Obviously he has worked with no money, because the whole movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that is going on forever. I've never seen so much time in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is probably less than 60 seconds of blob footage in the whole movie, and most of the rest are people who get involved. in a very poorly written, start-up dialogue. It was nice to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good heavens ... How can decisive people think anyone in their right mind will believe them as teenagers?
