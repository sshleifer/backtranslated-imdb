Looking back at another bad nightmare successor like Freddy's Revenge, at least give credit to try something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, there are the creative deaths as usual, such as a child who is part of a cartoon and "Super Freddy" is facing, but even scenes like this are not to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are not boring. . <br /> <br /> It marked the official death of clumsiness in the series. Freddy now seems to be the comic relief ... but for what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
