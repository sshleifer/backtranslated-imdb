54 is a movie about a club with that much title around the 70's. It features the classic, beautiful bartender. The sexy women. The high-powered owner. The party. When all the chaos gets tangled, it seems that the barman (played by Phillipe) is in the middle of everything. <br /> <br /> I will be as blunt and honest as possible while avoiding any straightforward unfair or false comments (like an "ok" movie). I really find it a terrifying movie that is complemented by its deadly role. Every time I sit down to watch a movie visiting Salma Hayek, I always wait to see her beauty, which is simultaneously printed with a good performance, but the reality suddenly reminds me how completely talented she is. I mean, what did she ever bequeath the masses, except her huge table dance in 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who gives nothing on the screen, but his good looks and foolish facade, otherwise known as 'scene'. Mike Myers is not as bad as this 2, at least he gives the Film something worthy. Play the seedy, extrovert co-founder of the 54 Club. The type that would hate the majority view (ie work well done), puts a somewhat convincing performance that hardly enjoys the movie. But unfortunately, it's not enough to save the movie from its baseless and flat nothing. Most 'bad' bad movies I find something from the movie, but it doesn't really matter. Neve Campbell is not bad, but she's just there. The storyline is boring, the writer seems to be more bent on making a movie of this style and decoration and forgot to add anything else. Any meaning. Any class. Anything whatsoever. Because like most ornaments, it's just hollow useless objects that are just beautiful to look at, very related to the basis of this disastrous movie. <br /> <br /> Really, an hour and a half I could have spent doing something more exciting, like talking to 90-year-old relatives over the weather.
