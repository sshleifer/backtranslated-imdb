The movie starts with a nice song. It looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way, but then we are suddenly forced to make a comedy. With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like adults. Their screens are quite funny and get boring. There is a bored part of Tanushree's brother being killed. By the end, the film is trying to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes, but it gets stupid. Then a long, bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI awaits, there is also a long chase in Payal's house. <br /> <br /> The movie is so boring that it lets you sleep. <br /> <br /> Direction by Priyan is very bad music (Pritam) is routine except the first song <br /> <br /> Camera work is bad, the movie has a cheap look throughout <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he pays his rent. and I was glad the actor wasn't hard on top and like other movies. But No, he becomes his usual self and becomes mostly annoying. Tusshar shouldn't be in a movie, his wheel delivery is terrible. Sharman is the saving grace. He is the only actor who performs very well in this film. Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic movie as an adult, but does not impress much Tanushree is bad as always.
