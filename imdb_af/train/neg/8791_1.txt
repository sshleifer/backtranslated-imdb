Be warned! <br /> <br /> It's a crap that other crap won't even be in the company because it's among them! Okay, get it out of the way, let me say something substance. <br /> <br /> I saw Ashes of Time very long ago, but think it was a fresh assumption on the material based on a highly revered wuxia of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, in spite of all the WCWs, it has failed to fit the novel on screen, according to many wuxia fans. mostly it is just shots of drip water, beads of sweat, legs of horses running, etc. I couldn't sit by most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give the owner. . Wong's movies are yet another shot after hearing a lot of praise, especially from Cannes. I was inspired by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start Chungking Express because it's his most accessible movie. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I had spent time wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious. Some professional reviewers call it a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It's all good if the director has a point of view to say why these things happen and tell them. But no, he just shows what is. Faye Wong's play is very typical of Hong Kong's style: eclipse, deer in the headlight wide-eyed expression, trying to be cute and girlish-type acting; The rest of the roll is equally uninspired. <br /> <br /> I think the word, Author, is a euphemism for a director trying something new and different, which should be bothered, but not one that has mastered the art of storytelling, and that is what Mr. Wong the past 17 years!
