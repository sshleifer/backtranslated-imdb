I see a lot of movies. See the original wargames year ago and loved it. Computers where most of us and the movie were still a big puzzle were convincing, in their own way. <br /> <br /> However, this one looks like a low budget on Wednesday night special. Total crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak you won't believe it until you see the movie (which I don't recommend in the first place). I can't show one actor who really did well in this movie. But hey, with that writing I would be surprised if someone could do a good job. Many clich√© scenes. CGI seems to have been taken from the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood about just writing about it. Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste if you watch crazy movies.
