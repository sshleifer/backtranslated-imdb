OK this movie was really "unique" we will say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the movie, although it was said that she had a cooking problem during the movie. but she said she couldn't remember much of it. Well, it's her excuse, but what's different? I don't think they all had a coke problem. What wasn't that bad, I mean I think the plot was OK and it has some funny moments. Although the part where the man got that thing in his head was a bit too violent for my taste. Oh, I think I was disappointed, because Carrie Fisher is so fantastic and this movie has done nothing to her.
