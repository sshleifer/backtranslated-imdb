This overstated, short-lived (two-week) series is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver goes to a strip bar. I'm not quite sure what they mean by "pioneers" and "original" when they crawled on Lynch and his fool TV opus. What exactly are their criteria of what is original? Certainly, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" it is original. Definitely. Besides "Law & Order", TP says originality left and right. <br /> <br /> Fans of TP often say the show was canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough, open enough for the show's alleged "strangeness", its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. As a fan of weirdness myself, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing to do with the outside wall over TP; it is a mere vigilant, but foolish whodunit who walks around in circles, turns webs in every corner but (or through) ultimately nowhere. The alleged strangeness is always forced; The characters do not behave in a strange way as much as they act in an idiotic way half the time. There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> When I look at the "strange dream" series in "Living In Oblivion" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) to give to the tired guy , late-use-a-midget-in-a-dream scene clich√©, I think of Lynch. You want strange? "Eraserhead" is weird - in fact it's strange, it's basically abstract. You want a unique TV program? See "The Prisoner". You want a strange look? Felini and Leone's films offer it. TP looks like an exaggerated TV crime drama in which all the young people look like models. The throw gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies a lot. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the TP producers said Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle's? Sheryll Fenn's? Like this effect, "hunks" are straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not misunderstand me; There is nothing wrong with getting an attractive role, especially with beauty like Fenn (as Madonna would look like 1000 times more beautiful), but don't go around and say you're making a strange show with strangers. " I never understood Lynch's deceived fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I have to get a medal to fix his name). He is not unlikely, but does not have charisma, which looks a little too thin and shiny His character's ridiculous "eccentricities" were not interesting at all, but one of Lynch's attempts to force the strangeness, and tried hard to defend his reputation - he completely lost his edge but that time. was an "elephant man" who was very sub-par compared to his first two movies, which followed, was often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings in his poorly composed ve rhale that has no water on closer inspection. In other words, Lynch is every intellectual wannabe's treasure. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was murdered by her father ...? He was obsessed with the devil or so nonsense. This is the best thing this "big thought" can come up with ... You have B-movie horror movies that end up with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch isn't bright or hardworking enough to get a great story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and see my "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Nepotism Cases" list.
