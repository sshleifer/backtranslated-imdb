Here's an indie movie I really wanted, but eventually it couldn't. The lack of writing (volunteering in the capital letters) really shows off and kills the picture. The story is an awkward debris that's not worth trying out. I got bored quickly within 10 minutes and then suffered the rest of the first 40 minutes - hopefully for the best - before the chapter is stopped, stop (graciously) to the end. It wasn't worth it either. effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly trying too hard to be smart, to lift its best rows of EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has not been done before, and better. This movie would be much more fun than a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature it just feels filled and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I understand the financial reasons I have accepted motivated to extend it to 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I congratulate him.
