As a native film professor, I can honestly say that it may be one of the worst movies with indigenous content I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root canal than to see this movie again. The use of stereotyping, unconscious attempts to use traditional coyote stories and poor camera work has only been made worse by the glib uncreative storyline and bad writing. The author and director showed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portray indigenous people and communities. If this person is indigenous, they should go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and bad sense of humor they developed. If this person is non-native, they should seriously reconsider their white privilege and ask themselves whether they display uncontrolled inadvertent racism or if they are deliberately ignorant. My only hope is that the native actors in this movie had a good time and at least paid for their efforts. If you want to see good indigenous movies, watch: Christmas in the clouds, dance my outside, medicine field, PowWow highway, smoke signals ... just to name a few.
