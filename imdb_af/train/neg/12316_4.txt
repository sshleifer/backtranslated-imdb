Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underestimated comedies in the past, such as 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. More than a "Police Academy" movie as his inspiration, it puts Steve Martin in the old Phil Silvers role as an army sergeant who always puts scams under his nose. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon seem shaky when an old enemy visits the base, determined to catch Bilko. Nothing really happens, really. All this is pretty boring. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman are pushing some of their efforts, but they are all better than that and it is quite painful to see how they work with such thin materials.
