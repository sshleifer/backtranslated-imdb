I'll be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with a room temperature IQ. Sorry liberals, feminists, etc. No women will ever be a seal. They can also forget about the concept or in the battle. Don't go. You see, hard as it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that it is 2007, reality cannot change things to avoid people hurting their feelings. Men can't give birth or breastfeeding (Oh, I forgot San Franfreako.) <br /> <br /> Women don't have the physical power to be equal to men in battle or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Lastly, I can't upset a bloody hoot in hell than I just wrote. Think about it - if it upset you that it just warms my heart. I didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth. This imbecile movie is nothing more than a comedy and a common one.
