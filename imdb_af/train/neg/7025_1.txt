I wish I could give this movie zero or even lower, because unfortunately it is what it deserves. I honestly never walk out of a movie, but this one was so terribly terrible that I couldn't stand it for a moment. Please, please, please - for the sake of mankind - skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really drag in, it's not. <br /> <br /> It has unattractive, unattractive lead, messy structure, ridiculous dialogue, and it is absolutely unconvincing in every way imaginable. At an absolutely basic level, it fails to entertain. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is such stages, it's WORSE as any student movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if that wasn't enough, the whole movie relies on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) vote on narration. The writer could just have written such a novel because they insisted on telling everything, rather than showing it. We just have to accept that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have a special connection, although there is no character development to illustrate it. This movie is also introduced to new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but written in a freezer frame of the characters with their names across the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. We really don't know any of them. <br /> <br /> It's the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm a gay woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both saw this movie as a depressing performance of queer cinema. I start to think that lesbian and gay movies are much like Christian rock. No matter how horrible it is, people will still grow and camp through it, no matter how poor the quality is. Please do not rent this !! Let us rather encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by encouraging "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures" instead of swallowing whatever they are, without think of the gay community (ie Queer as Folk).
