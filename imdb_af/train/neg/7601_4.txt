It's a movie that shows that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good movie. Certainly, the viewer was treated to several fine scenes from Los Angeles in the thirties. I especially had the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram that goes up the hill, but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating because it creates a mood that 'something is going to happen' - and nothing do not. The writing also keeps track of a plot or action or trauma - and time and again it doesn't deliver. Not even the (I suppose) theme of the movie, the characters' essential misfit. The protagonists, both too beautiful for their roles, felt no repression or pain, and the writing did not expose us to anyone. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? It's another story. His character was so well formed, so perfectly played, that I wanted the camera to follow him.
