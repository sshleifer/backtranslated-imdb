My life is about saving animals. I do volunteering with a cat rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian because I couldn't kill an animal to sustain my life. I can't even kill a spider, I'll put it outside. The scene where the children throw dresses at the bird until it dies, with Earlier part in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, has become sick and has haunted me ever since. It simply convinces me that people are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The end - the foster parents take earlier - does not solve the portrayal of animal cruelty. Why would someone have their child see this movie?
