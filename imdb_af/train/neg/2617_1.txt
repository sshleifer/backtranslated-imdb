This film was pure pain. I went to the theater for a few minutes, and I wondered when the movie would start. All the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their badges, villain must come out, but none of them ever started. By the time these things happened, I was already bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that require enormous tension and buildup, it felt like the necessary frames were cut. Kid's stuff doesn't have to be that way. Children's movies can be as resounding and engaging as adult ones. The excuse, "hey, it's for children," is bull. I will take "Sword in the Stone" any day. It was terrible. I get the feeling that Disney will stick out today. And for the kids, the 10-year-old I saw here would agree ... pure waste.
