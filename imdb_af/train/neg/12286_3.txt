The summary made by my cable TV guide made it sound more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, a title previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From the opening scene I could say it was going to be really bad, but I was so bored that I couldn't care less. This film features laughing acting, especially by the man who is tormented in his dreams, unbelievably like in non-credible plot twists, and the crappiest music I've heard, and I live in a time when the likes of Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the airwaves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it is not funny. One would be a movie so boring and boring and therefore not scary because it would try to spit things here and there with some funny one-liners, but no. We tried stricken Guy's self-centered friend to be funny, but failed. (spoiler) And please tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self-sufficient enough to visit a creepy prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! Making a horror movie makes it at least credible. This one is all but.
