A propaganda movie for the Palestinian "cause". If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you would have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or just an anti-Zionist --- nothing wrong to plead the destruction of a country?) Or unfairly in support of Palestinian goals (eg mass murder, destruction of Israel) is the documentary for you. Must make for an entertaining evening at university campuses across the UK and USA. However, any informed and intellectually honest person will be furious at the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope those who are really unaware of the situation are being damaged by this anti-Semitic dirt.
