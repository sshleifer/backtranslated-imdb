Bo Derek's debut film has remained invisible for eight years? And that's how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director is he virtually the Ed Wood of erotic theater? not that it is especially explicit, since Bo (atypical sports dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! John also wrote and photographed; The latter leads to a proper footage of the Greek island environment over which the narrative is determined ?? but the plot is puerile and the dialogue is horrible! <br /> <br /> The character Peter Hooten played was raised with Bo's family: they grew up as a brother and sister, but in their teens, the couple discovered that they were attracted to each other (but, as I said don't expect any sexual fireworks!). Yet, the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each have an obsession with the film that is not only stupid in itself, but annoying in their relentlessness ?? Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and expects a vessel to appear (which of course does it in the final); Derek's even more fun? She's looking for a great antique bathtub! For the record, the couple are married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Also involved in the non-events is the mayor of the female city and a photographer lothario who is a model from Bo (and which of course causes the wrath of the jealous Hooten). Occasionally we are not really getting out of the show of old Hollywood classical artists in an open-air movie house to which the whole town meets (under the titles titled THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! By the end of the day, while Bo's naivete is undeniable throughout, it is not enough to compensate for the movie's overwhelmingly dull and amateurization.
