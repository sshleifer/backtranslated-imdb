As Alien, Jurassic Park and many other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add lots of sugar and you will get this one. The film starts around 1100ad throughout England and then jumps to California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new Security Chief and Military Advisor to a Science Laboratory 400 meters underground. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the chief scientist and we soon find it a cloning room and they have found something new to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the above movies, hell breaks loose and begins to pick up our characters. The special effects on the monster are pretty good for a direct video and Dean Cain does what he is paid for. But forget about the rest of the group if we find out why we have never seen them before. Again, don't go into high expectations and you'll be fine.
