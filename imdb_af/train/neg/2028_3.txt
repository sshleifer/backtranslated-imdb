On the surface, "Show me the money" must have completed at least a full season. You hosted the overall William Shatner, surrounded by a baker's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called the "Million Dollar Dancers". You had knowledgeable participants who had interesting stories to tell about their lives and who probably knew many pop culture trivia. And you had big money! So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was the failure. A good match show requires at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting pacing and the ability to play the viewer at home. The best, most enduring children already have three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had nothing. <br /> <br /> The rules for this game were one of the most complex of any leading game game in history. . Let's try to explain how the game worked as short as possible. <br /> <br /> A participant started with a single word or short phrase, followed by the selection letters A, B, C (subtle plug for the network?). Each letter was linked to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. Once a contestant has selected one of the letters, they could answer or pass the question and select a second letter. If they did, they got the next question and had the same option. However, if they had passed the second question, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After responding and before finding out if their answer was correct, they had to choose one of the 13 dancers. on stage, each with a different amount of money in a scroll next to it. They have revealed their dollar amount (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the participant has answered correctly ... or answered incorrectly ... that amount will be added to their pot or deducted. <br /> <br /> So far with me? In addition, there was one dancer who had something known as "The Killer Card." If you chose the dancer with the Moordena card and you got your question right, you were safe, and the game continued. However, if you were wrong, you had one final question to answer. If you had the final question wrong, you were out of the game. If you are right, the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no quit, no money left until you answered six questions correctly, or six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole that you couldn't earn enough money to get back. Have this? Okay! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was a complete lack of tension due to the design of the game. A contestant could answer questions they knew they didn't know and answered many questions they knew, which made the pressure even less. Then they could still find a low dollar amount, even after they denied a question, which meant there was not yet a "drama". And the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still had a chance to win was a big mistake. And the discussion of the questions was deadly slow: often the questions were so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there were any doubts about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The pacing, the lack of real stress at any stage during the show and the very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's terpsichorean talents.
