Well, I had to wait until it came out on the video to see it, and I wish I had caught scary movie 2 on the cable, and it fell in love with more of the same, which I was at CRACK ... I mean if you want a plane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicle, then you will probably be in heaven, but if you used to the usual WAYANS COMEDY, you will be disappointed, there were many more Eyebrows in this one that will keep the young hormone angry teenagers happy, which is probably why it was a box office that hit the first week. I enjoyed scarce movie 2 ten times more than this feed, and share one 5 times as much. Strange that the better of the 3 part 2, but then I always said Halloween 2 better than the original. But she's just me. The funniest part of the movie should be the way the Aliens Say goodbye. But it wasn't worth the $ 11 I spent on catching a matinee with my fiancee. Save yourself cash and take part 2 back on the cable until it is released on videotape, and then rent it, don't buy it.
