The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film could not embrace a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, the total revocation was released a few years later and it did a good job. Even a clockwork orange released in the 70's did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. The dark German expressionist colors, the black and white footage of the vision screens, are not a reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white-collar work, but he dressed as if working with oil and fat in a garage. This film decides to take a mock communist approach to design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel did not necessarily determine a communist, worship-humble-worker theme. This book should be seriously adapted to a modern context, as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is irritating, the lack of foresight is irritating. This movie looks like it was made to deny a sense of realism or credibility when it is exactly necessary to hammer the message of the novel to the viewer.
