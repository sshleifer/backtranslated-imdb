This movie may have poor production values, but it does so well. The special effects are great and well done. My favorite part of the movie was to play Chrissy by Janelle Brady. She is super warm and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, just like the other members. This film actually tries to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Just comedy, brutal movie.
