Even for a tired movie model like the natural and human cycle that dominates in the 1970s, ants fall miserably short to be even slightly effective (though for reasons they didn't). It's so ominous. Apparently, these ants, who have been bulldozed at an inn, have been poisonous waste for decades and have now been adapted to release poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are fatal. Looking at actors of a little familiarity, falling in the midst of small black specks, is painfully funny in a not-so-good but very bad way. So many scenes just look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a dumpster while being attacked, Suzanne Sommers crying in bed while sleeping in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey what rub a rocket and the list goes on and on. The dangers shown range from ants that crawl across the walls of a drain to black lines ants. The film for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seems to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy must sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope she got a good use for the money because it is clear that this was the only reason why a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense. Although it is quite a bad movie, it is visible - once for me, and many of the seventies have bad movie qualities - gifted actors who embarrass themselves, made for the TV feeling and the dreaded creatures of the nature that gives revenge on man. This time, the man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be touched. Actually very scary.
