After being pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss. Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. Although Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) leaves much to be desired, it's good. Her character is at the same time all-knowing, confused and sexually unfair (the subtotal of Sandra's past comes across as unnecessary stuffing that does little to develop her already shallow character). The two teenage boys have donated proper performances, although their forensic expertise and catch-my-can-attitude are trusted by turbulent mistakes that shout: "We did it!" Chris Penn as the all-obvious suspect is wasted here, such as Ben Chaplin's token partner / charity. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Forward *** Moderate action, the biggest mistakes can be traced to a TV-of-the-week plot that never buys you in the first place entirely in the murder motifs and, as already mentioned, the stupid mistakes (a rare food on the murder scene, a very convenient and framework of the schoolkeeper, the two boys who are in the public together, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc.) , the intention is to be intrigues to be bored and disappointed by the killers, the end being strict "At the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie, using the now-clicked tactics of the the scene, at the beginning of the film, and then fill the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and he did not lack the so-called intelligence that the film claimed. A somewhat promising concept r poorly executed and poor in almost every respect. * from ****.
