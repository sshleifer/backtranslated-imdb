This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Can someone please tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this fine should be adjusted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how can you possibly connect with Ask The Dust (the novel)? And if you wanted to make this story in a movie, why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production featuring Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I don't get it. <br /> <br /> Adapting the story has been poor, and if you read and liked the book, I'm almost certain you won't like what Towne did with it. . <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the movie you may find the decisive stranger, the acting bad and the cinematography just a little exaggerated. But you hope for the best. I hoped a lot during this movie. I really wanted to be good. But it just gets worse, and it's as simple as this: whether you're reading Fantes novel or not, it's not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - many shots of Colin Farells naked buttocks. <br /> <br /> I could complain much more about this movie, but why waste my time. I saw it. Alright. I had to see it because I liked the book so much and was curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for Colin's lovely little mustache at the end of the movie. So nice ... If he wore it all the time, I'd give it 2/10.
