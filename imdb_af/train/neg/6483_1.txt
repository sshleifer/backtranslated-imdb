It wasn't good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality was from the memories I had of the previous movie that was opposed to the 'new' personalities (or lack thereof). I seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by Ariel because of how absurd it was. It was serious. It just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney channel. Everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassment without any real connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was the terrible songs - not noticeable, not great. In the original Ariel has a wonderful and powerful voice and all the songs are alluring and fun. You remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not in the least creative; It's as if they are talking in an annoying song song, pretty bad, disappointing. I don't have that will-sing-they feel you usually come from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It is as if none of these movies wanted to do, so they hardly made any effort. . . this movie will need a new story line, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying "look at me! Look at me! I'm so annoying!" mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
