I haven't seen it for more than twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain, a natural. I think I looked at OJ again, which I saw Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a bit bored that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, it has moved plots. When reading other posts, I remember it was a plot that they were kidnapping a rich girl, but then that valuable stamp business came out of the blue. <br /> <br /> I was on my way, a seal? If it's going to be a later movie, I'll probably take it out to look it out again, but I won't be nostalgic about it. Not yet reason. <br /> <br /> There are better movies from the seventies like this one to find out.
