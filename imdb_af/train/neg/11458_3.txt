I can remember Bo Derek's boom time and the UK is pressing attention (the gnome Sun & News of the World papers in particular) - everyone follows her little role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, she was very upset by her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly shaped bouncing breasts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is never her forte! I think they should make one of the three-tiered collections you always find in the DVD-bakkie-Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero bargain. All these movies can be nominated for the "So Bad They Are Great". <br /> <br /> It should be a guilty "buy" from me! If you ever read your press, or this comment, Ms Derek, don't be offended. You always had a soft spot and there are more important things happening in the world to worry you than your acting ability. Many Love.x
