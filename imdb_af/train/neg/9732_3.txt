First, the chief, Brad Dourif is a COOK. If you try to take this movie seriously, I guarantee he will destroy it for you. If you don't take him seriously, he's really nice to look at. As with another reviewer, I had the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for one another - killing the flames coming out of his arm in the car. Another big camping scene watched John Landis as a whimsical radio program producer who was roasting and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the movie for the last 15 minutes to be an incessant laugh. I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it.
