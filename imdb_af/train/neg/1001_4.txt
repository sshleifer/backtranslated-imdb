I rented it on DVD and I feel so bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about it in the DVD comment. It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those movies that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature, while not realizing that his story is almost a genre. Plus, it's a bit simplistic about the problem in many ways, and the characters' behavior often leads to faith. I will tell a movie that you would get something if you didn't have much movie / TV / literature / life behind you. To be honest, I saw almost exactly the same story in horror strips even). Otherwise, his point is made before and more artificially. And it comes to the big problem, namely that it really doesn't have much role in the film. It eventually becomes a fairly mere movie that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay.
