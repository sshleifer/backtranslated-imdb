I got this movie in the $ 5 bin at walmart. I would not recommend looking at this move. I can give it to one of my friends if I'm angry with them and they want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and sank through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I knew how boring this movie would be before it turned on. It was my mistake to think that something in this movie would happen. It's just about a group of people going from one boat camp to another. The drillers treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people fight in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Well, here's my rant on this movie: For me this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies you put in and watched, because you want to turn it off, but you are hoping to get it up. That doesn't mean that. After the movie was over me behind the T.V, I was angry because I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life, and another 10 minutes to write this review to warn people about it.
