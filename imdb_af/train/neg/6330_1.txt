If you enjoy the original SNL cast and shows, avoid this movie at all costs. When it first came out, my friends and I waited more than an hour to go to a chosen movie house. Halfway through the movie theater 3/4 was empty. We refused to think it would be better. When the movie ended, we were the only one in the theater. The movie lasted only one day in all theaters, and then disappeared. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on this film. The film was a joke on the episodes of SNL that came out just after the film was released and closed. We've all been trying to mr. Mike "contacted by phone and mail to get a refund but was completely ignored.
