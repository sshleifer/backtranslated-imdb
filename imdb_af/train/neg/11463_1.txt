It's just a reaction to the yahoo that says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre that defines MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, big whites (and other species of shark, bull, black tip, ocean white tip, tiger) are known to populate areas where easy prey is found. People don't often make it on the menu, but the shark in the movie has been repeatedly pointed out that it shows abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The chance of a killer whale destroying almost a whole town, devising a human nemesis, sank a few dozen thick North Atlantic fishing boats and knew when certain people, all the friends of the aforementioned "nemesis", were near the water. To reach is so slim that it is lagable. Much like that of a Jaws knock. Laughable. Large white sharks are also known to chew regularly on boats, protective underwater pens and people on rafts and fire rigs as they look from below. A Shark, the size of Bruce (if you don't know it, look up) will be more than able to sink a boat like The Orca (that's the name of the blatant rip-off we discuss! ), As it will weigh up to 6000 pounds. I can go on, but I don't have to. Jaws are wonderful (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is shit (BLATANT rip-off jaws, lousy writing, horrific effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick). It does not take a masters of Columbia University to see it. See better movies.
