I don't know what you're talking about. The first time I watched this movie with two of my friends, we couldn't stop crying. This is one of the funniest shits I've ever seen. Those comments on the porn are so right, but hahahaha. Yes, this movie is actually worse, but it has caused tears in my eyes because of the false characters, poor dialogue and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it?! It looks like one of those movies from my managers, etc. class. The props look like they came from a high school drama exhibition. The music sounds like it's from an original Nintendo system game. The only thing that even came close to me was scared of this movie, that it had a killer gap, who, who is not crawled by fat, is lurking fools? hahaha if anyone ever has to look at it, they should look at the actors' oral errors such as letting on words and some of their facial expressions. hahahaha I'm dead. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
