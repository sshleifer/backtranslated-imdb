It was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar was until her old play of empty expressions of terror and shock. She couldn't sell her character, nor anybody else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought the Grudge was a good thing, you shouldn't see it unless you enjoy being wasted. time and your life. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for free, so I don't want it to be overcrowded as a ransom by a man who lost $ 8 on a terrible movie. It was free, it still sucked, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
