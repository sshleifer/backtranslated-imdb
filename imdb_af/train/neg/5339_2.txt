OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'm going to see most things, because the multiplex theaters are so good (I remember the old "flea pit" single-screen theaters and I'm the healthy side of 40 ). In England, this film is released as "Liar", it is a dog. This is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photograpie and set only.
