A good throw (with one big exception) pushes his way through Epstein's cleverly light satire. Mansfield was never better or funny than she was with Walston, who is a veteran determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his friends - including the suave con artist Grant - go on leave in San Francisco and start off with the city's heaviest party while denying the escape of the service entirely through industrial talk. The only thing about this movie that is not nice is Suzy Parker's one-note show as Grant's love affair, which takes too much of the movie's time and slows the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; The gimmick is that she intends to love every service worker (of course her duty for the war effort), but he is a married man who, however, loves his wife. They steal the movie with little effort from Grant (who is amusing in the first part of the movie, when he is not with his non-actor co-star.
