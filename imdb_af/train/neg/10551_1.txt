Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a man who destroys the country, showing self-reduction as a way of dealing with his abused childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading on the film before I look, viewers won't have an idea what it is about. <Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies can be attracted to watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh plays of devastating and disturbing real-life footage, but unless they also love pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art house theater, will find this one a real job to go through. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images accompanied by discordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, these sensible numbingly horrible drives are the perfect way to test your common sense. If you still have all your marbles, you will turn off this garbage and watch something decent (I watched the whole thing, but know that I was barking!).
