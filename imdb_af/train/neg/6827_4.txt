Dumb is so stupid, in this totally uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Essentially, it starts when Chris Klein tries to maintain a low profile, eventually in an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", without any laughter. To make black comedy work, it must be disgraceful, which is "Play Dead". To make black comedy work, it can't make sense, which is "Play Dead". What "Play Dead" really is is a town full of swamp. However, Fred Dunst does a fairly fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from a simple plan, while Jake Busey does a fairly fair copy of Jake Busey. - NOTE
