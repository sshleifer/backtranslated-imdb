What happened in making this movie so it ended up being the total mess it is? Just a year after the Breakfast Club, a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in St Elmo's Fire (acting and acting on the way, more as they still fail high school from the former but without the grip or discipline for their roles depicting. <br /> <br /> Was it directing or writing, as it was the same person (Joel Schumacher), it must be both, but since then Schumacher has us "The Phantom of the Opera", " Phone Booth, "A Time to Kill" and two Batman movies, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever" ranging from good to big. It has no genius whatsoever, no comedy is worth anything and is a lot far from the mark that is really valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Example: The character Wendy (a rich little daughter with a heart to do well and helps the less fortunate games by Mare Winningham) reveal to Billy (an irregular slum cheating on his wife and on his girlfriends, drinking far too much uh and he t no order of order in his life that is appropriately played by Rob Lowe) that she is still a virgin. Billy really sees a challenge and possible conquest, but Wendy is not right. Wendy isn't really right, it's hard to believe she's in this click of friends. Later in the story, when Billy's wife left him, took his child and was married to another, some of the strings of his life somehow pulled together. Billy leaves for New York, leaves and leaves all parental responsibility for his baby daughter, he convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect "gift" to her. And Wendy, who works as a social worker to help broken families, doesn't seem to be phased by this despot. Give me a chance. The one thing she can only give once, does she give up on a loser who leaves his family and friends? Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and enjoyable moment. <br /> <br /> There are many more examples where there is a complete breakdown between what is real and valuable and that the deeds are made to look like the virtue. br /> <br /> I suppose some might say "it was the 80's", but I remember it was in the 80's that men were held responsible for the children they were feeding whether they were in a marriage or outside . /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad because it is out of sync with what it's really valuable and right. <br /> <br /> As far as the technique is concerned (not the story), it was terrible as well. It is disobedient and feels like a 3-hour movie edited after 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and leaps in time simply do not make sense. Counting on what is in the room of the working room, put it back in and the movie will probably flow much better ... but it's still a horrible movie. Perhaps Schumacher has become a better and stronger director. since 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was over his head when writing the script for St Elmo's Fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way - that's what I really thought happened.
