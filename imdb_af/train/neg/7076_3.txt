Windshield drivers say that 100 km / h looks fast until you drive 150, and 150 mph looks fast until you drive 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> Andalusian Dog looks awesome bizarre until you see Eraserhead, and Eraserhead looks awesome bizarre until you've seen Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten looks awesome bizarre until you've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Race fans, there is nothing in the whole world of film like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> Alabama's Ghost comes as close as any of its films to a coherent plot, involving only hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, wizards, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants, and Mystery Gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, which of course crosses the Sunset District in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> What is really surprising is that someone gave him a lot of money to make the Ghost of Alabama. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow, this makes Alabama's Ghost so wrong. You look at a horrible cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least some of the strangers are excusable on the grounds that they make the movie from the main room on their Discover cards, of course. But Alabama's Ghost is made with a real budget, and it's angry. I mean, I have a script about a tribal cannibal living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the bush from Twizzlers, and no one beats ME by blowing a checkbook. How did the man get the money for FOUR of the most flashy movies ever made?
