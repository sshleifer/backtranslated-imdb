I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 holes. It's a mole every 5 minutes. Seriously though, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not have to be fixin. A streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'trouble'. Pure magic.
