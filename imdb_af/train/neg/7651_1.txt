It should come as no shock to you if I say Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it unpredictably, it was as if a sample sample had dissolved, had eaten the result, and then threw it. The final product will still be this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems to be based on an old (!) Atari video game, that the movie has something or something to do with a portal to the guts of the earth, the demolition of demons and ancient civilizations. Something about this is two worlds, the darkness and the light. (Guess who ours is.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a very super-advanced civilization opened the portal, demons were over and had an explosion, and then civilization wiped out. That is why we have never heard enough of them. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, who may be playing for Heathers and Pump Up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher who has done something bad. when he was 10 years old. He is hot on the trail of one of the artefacts of the advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, who tried to find out what happened to the long ago civilization. But Carnby believed he was not going to find the answers he was looking for. He left the group. <br /> <br /> But, look, these beasts are out, and they get their prey in different ways, such as cutting them, dividing them into the middle, introducing neurological control devices into them, or just to they kill the zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It's about as distilled I can make the plot. It's pretty complicated and incomprehensible. In similar movies one can see that the fearless researcher / adventurer portrays things one step at a time and when we are mentally minded by the researcher, it's great fun. But when the screens of attack move to attack without perspective or context ... not so much fun. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible, except for Slater, who (although almost embarrassed in the film) showed that he could carry the acting burden. He had to; get it - Tara Reid is thrown as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I saw the lick of a lifetime when Denise Richards was thrown as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here agrees with Richards, fond of emotion for the mad emotion. Highlights include Reid expressing Newfoundland as 'New Fownd Land'. Reid delivers most of her lines in a dazed, throat monotone (similar to the fact that she's been filming the whole week before the filming), Reid - a museum curator, do you think - spend a lot of the movie in a midriff wearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yes, she was as credible as Jessica Simpson to offer shares. Oh why should the beautiful be so stupid? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid is so nice. She looks like she needs eternal food.) Almost everyone else in the throw is completely forgotten, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played one of Burke's leaders. of 713. Dorff's character wasn't very well developed, but nothing in the movie was from the sets of characters to Tara Reid. But I'm going out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the annoying and completely passing storyline is hard to follow with the movie moving like that, but director Uwe Boll throws in a sounding, sensible soundtrack. it's so hard you can't hear what the actors say in some of the scenes! It can't be right. Given the acting level, but maybe thanks to Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a fun note. The opening hours of the movie include narration of the words that creep over the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You've heard the famous Star Wars theme while the prologue crept. There was certainly no narrative needed; Why do I need some deaf to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers just looking for blind people? Perhaps this also explains why the soundtrack was so hard - they also looked for hard-of-hearing people. The narrator inexplicably had a lash for the first few lines of the crawl, and it lost it. Odd. <br /> <br /> Only in the dark is a loud, dull mishmash of scary acting, an incoherent script and ham-handed directing. Almost no note rings. There is so much chaos that the audience just cares for the characters and roots for their downfall. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed than comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, as there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if your Boll planned it that way? I can't give it the lowest score, because I have little hope for it - and it never grabbed me enough to work on it. It's scary, even though Slater left him a little loose.
