This movie makes Peter an eleven in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably non-Robin-Hood costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a chat idiot. And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL CONSICE. And of course, like every Disney cartoon should have a character that had too many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys that one. The only character who was not ashamed of this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? The Darling parents don't even have the time to notice their children are gone !!! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and they ruined it! Also the well-known nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a beautiful piece. There are no drops and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It's a wonder he even lost his shadow and she helped him hold it. (Although with his shoes and it doesn't make me sense.) <br /> <br /> The destruction of a great story like this, just to entertain children, must be illegal. So now you know you didn't know it yet - this Disney version has nothing significant in common with the original story - it's not really a children's story, but a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> It just annoys me at no end.
