The film of this film contains some of the best actors of New Zealanders. Many of whom I have seen in wonderful roles, fill this film with a deep shame to be just from the same country as them. The fake American accent is the first idea that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. If another review is rather rather noticeable, the luxury cruise liner is actually an old car fighter, decorated with some of the multi-color flags stolen from a used car party. Most of the castings appear to be the big New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It is as if this movie was thrown on a Christmas party in the coastline, due to too much gins, and possibly some salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" adhering to "The Love Boat", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend you watch this movie, as a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
