"Smithereens" is the kind of worthless movie that just hangs out between the cable channels and takes up space like a cheese-like novel in the public library. A worthless piece of tension and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman, the film is full of bad acting, bad sound, bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the movie. Many better movies never make it to the market and why junkies like this one and never seem to be one of life's great mysteries. (D)
