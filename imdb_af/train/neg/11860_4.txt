If you haven't figured out what will happen in this movie in the first five minutes, give it another few minutes. Lilia is a widow. She was left on the shelf for too long and she wanted to erupt. She has a teenage daughter who just points out that she is not younger. As she looks up her daughter, she discovers a world she never dared to do ... the cabaret, where she can dance belly dance in sham-colored outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamistic. This is portraying men. It's rather strange like Lilia stoops to jiggle for them, not for money, but only for hell. When she succeeds in raising them, it makes her again like a woman. She didn't want to contact them, but she was addicted to the attention. The other dancers are mostly aging women who look like men and realize that their time is in the spotlight, short-lived. Not short enough I do not say. She finds romance, but short, with you guess .... No surprises here we haven't seen. Although the end is good, you realize that it could not end in any other way. Perhaps this movie is not aimed at my demographic- 30 Man
