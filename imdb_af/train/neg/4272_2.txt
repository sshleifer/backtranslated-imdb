This kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another is trying to damage (and ultimately eliminate) the reputation of a naive person to take over their lives. Deadly attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Crib Rock, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some of these. But while some, especially deadly attraction and Pacific Heights can provide at least some extremely paranoid, thrilling characters or a few plot twists, illegal access plays everything in the book. And it wasn't for the celebrity of his stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe). This movie would sink faster than mediocre Danial Steele miniseries. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, a ceaselessly naive man who calls for the help of an officer when someone breaks into his home and attacks his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he escapes silently his anger to feel helpless in the situation of the wrong policeman (Ray Liotta), a typical psychopathic villain without limitations to his power. Initially with Carr in empathy (probably just pretending to do so), the police were friends with the couple. But soon the police want Carr out of the way, so destroy the guys' lives, almost any way he can. (It's pretty easy if you're a policeman, and if you're the policeman taking over the man's security system in his home) and presumably getting his wife. It seems less purposeful, and more like police just wants to prove its power. The woman is more like a trophy, in other words as an end. And the story is completely out of the book, you can probably predict every look before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our most important naive character realizes that he is a victim of credit card fraud (committed by the psychopathic villain) to the reverse-his-not-really-dead final.
