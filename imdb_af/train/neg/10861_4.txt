Maybe I miss something because I read more positive things about The Man Who Hates Himself than I read bad reviews - and I just can't get it. I love my noirs to have a little style with them talking, watching and acting like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or what you want to call. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His rolled, rolled-out bed look is so far from the dashing, smooth noir archetype as you will find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases I have seen for a while. She is not convincing in the role. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it is tired and there are no real surprises or something new to the genre. I could have predicted the result of the man who had been deceiving about five minutes. And the final cats-and-mouse wallpaper is simply old, boring. Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined a pacing.
