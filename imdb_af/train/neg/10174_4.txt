I saw it back in '94 when it was finally released. Apparently, because Orion was in bankruptcy, I think the film wasn't released a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> I have difficulty remembering details, partly because I haven't seen it for long, but I remember it as a very dim movie. I debated if I had to walk out of it. The shop was neither interesting nor engaging. Was a 3rd rate America Graffiti imitation. <br /> <br /> None of the shows also makes it worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer has given it a high rating.
