This movie is not stupid. <br /> <br /> From Ralph Meeker's cast as Mike Hammer to the greasy climax, the film is an exercise in wood predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put together pieces to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... too stupid to get away with anything. The one was so badly drawn that he was subjected to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the movie are right out of the Play Stooges book. Velda's dance at the barracks, for example, or the bad man who accidentally stabbed his boss in the back. And the continuity interruptions are scandalous: Frau Blucher walks down the middle of the road when the camera is fastened to her lower legs, but she is right over the side when the camera returns for a bigger shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad man hammering Hammer passes a second to our hero in a bell, except that the bell shows he was seven minutes behind our guy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the big final is so bad it should be seen, which is the only reason it gets two points out of 10.
