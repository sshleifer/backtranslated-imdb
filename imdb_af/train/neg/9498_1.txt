If I'm looking for new cars, I don't expect to show boats. If I drink Coke fountain, I expect the drink to contain Coke. If I watch a movie that adorns him with the name of an excellent scientist, I expect it to be somehow relevant to that person or their work. It could have been people who discussed my grannys diary. The material being covered is only important because they are vaguely damaging science. I fell asleep for the first time, and the second time I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I'd rather look at the latest blockbuster. However, it is far from providing anything worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
