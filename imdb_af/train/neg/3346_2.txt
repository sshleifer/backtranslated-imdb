Cheezy action movie with Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a once-off military man who has returned to a teaching task. But the changes in the environment and the student body left him frustrated and he decided to hang it up. Things get dicey when they look at a lot of students in custody, some robbers take the school as a basis for operation for an armored car robbery. His Dolph is facing the bad things in battle until death. Jaw dropping back to the late grindhouse era mining films where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had glowing hair day by day. What a silly movie. Waitable in an I can't believe people have made such a way, it's an action movie that is probably condemned by the draw before the low budget, fake breakpoints and poor action was even a twist in a produsentoog. See how late in the movie as cars drive through the school (don't ask) they invade the security turret (don't ask because it looks more like a prison than a high school) and breaks the barely shaped shape apart not as it did in previous shots). What did the gods of bad movies do? Actually, I'm confused as it is directed by Sydney J Furie (Sydney), a really good director, who made films like The Boys in Company C. Did his ability fail, or was it hopeless and he didn't even bother? It's a turkey. A viewable one, but a turkey no less.
