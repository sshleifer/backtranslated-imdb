Well, since I saw part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they should never make part 4. Everything from the tough, and I mean a tough score for the very bad play. I dare anyone to watch it and not get bored of thoughts. <br /> <br /> I think sections 1 to 3 kept the strength of Damion's plot, but without him in this one, it's just not the same. Certainly at the end of Part 3, I got a little tired of the persistent story line, but it was a good conclusion at the end of the third. Again there was no reason for a part 4. Even though there was a lot better work than I had to sit down, lol. There will be half an hour of my life I will never see again.
