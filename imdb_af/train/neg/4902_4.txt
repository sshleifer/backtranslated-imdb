Almost in the same league as Yonfan's rather horrific color flowers, Spider Lillies turns the point home to make the premier cinema without the edge, or much in the way of cutting. It is a Taiwanese movie, which at this day and age becomes a novelty in a disturbing pace, but more than that twist, we can find very little in the way of the notable here. <br /> <br /> You should know that apparently Spider Lillies is also a lesbian theme story, but in every way it's nothing but a plastic jersey to lure into the easily seduced and gullible. In several ways we have here a repeat of co-recent Taiwan release Eternal Summer. When gay men received the short-term treatment, now we have the same with women. Zero Chou offers, for your non-existent build up, a story probably a fifteen year old. They did some of the artifacts, but eventually led to a most unpleasant, uninteresting foray. <br /> <br /> The Hongkong corner comes in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here her sport butch most watch. Although somewhat past in her previous work, Isella in Spider Lillies is listless and lacking in most departments. Her heart was not in it, or the whole lesbian drama pitch didn't quite appeal to her sensitivity. <br /> <br /> She is doing a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy, withdrawn and in control of a mentally challenged younger brother, played by John Shen, who gratefully grants the movie the only thespian-related salvation feature granted. Isabella's character, strangely called Takeko, but presumably originating from Hong Kong, soon hooks up with undivided youth Jade (Rainie Yang of the fine-repealed Meteor Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to the abandonment of her parents and life in general. Certainly, the grandmother component works well and touches, but otherwise Jade as a protagonist is just as disrupted as her counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> The two women share a past and very inadequately covered anxiety, with Jade working. As a webcam girl while Takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique spider's tattoo placed on her arm. Jade also wants to acquire this lot of design, resulting in Takeko investigating internal feelings of the issue through flashbacks and minimal discourse with the spooky Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is little discourse to write the home base, at least the intercourse is memorable? In a word, no. They kiss and close the end, but just as the eternal summer did not remind us long ago, there is a gorge that is measured in light years between sexual content and making ticket buyers think they will see sexual content . <Br /> <br /> This cynical expectation build seals Spider Lillies' destiny. With a bad story, ho-hum acting and a complete lack of relics to take away from the theater with you, this one kind of color flowers look good, think about it. At least there is a bit of Teresa Cheung's mammals. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and needs to be hit from the playlist of even the most mundane and rogue CAP festival. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for a pseudo-indie release, the soundtrack and cinematography don't even produce moments. of inspiration. It's just as good because it makes Spider Lillies much easier. Believe us, avoid it and you will not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
