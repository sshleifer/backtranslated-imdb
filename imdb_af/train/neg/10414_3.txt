It's a very stupid and low-profile movie about slavery in West India and it's Puddy's stars of the Seinfeld show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this contacted movie and he is noticeably slimmer here. Oliver Reed got the best bill, but he is not in the movie at all. Warburton plays a white slave and it's funny to see all the young and horny women of the rich old men praying for him because they all want sex with him. Eartha Kitt owns a bordello and they are so much nudity in the movie. If it is not drunk at the bordello, then it is the young women they turn with him. Then, of course, the slaves will be rebellious at the end and there is the bloody apostasy. No real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another confronted plot device to move the story together. Incredibly, they made a successor and Warburton and all the other role players came back! I hope they paid a lot of dough because this first movie is very bad. The nudity keeps it awake and Warburton's lack of any accent sometimes makes it ridiculous. Very bad movie, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
