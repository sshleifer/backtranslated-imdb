Bring out every stereotype and misrepresentation you have heard from demoralized Mormons, and you'll see they all died in this ridiculous apology for a movie. Eventually Kurt Hale's fortunes changed (thank you) and hopefully it will take a long time before we see any of his features in theaters. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amateurish (I think they have a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). The plot was limp and very rude. You really didn't understand why anyone did anything. It was as if I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this movie was a negative rating, because the scale won't allow me.
