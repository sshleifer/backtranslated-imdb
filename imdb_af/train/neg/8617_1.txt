After 10 minutes of watching this movie, I was confused. After looking 30 minutes, my toes curled. I simply couldn't believe it. The movie is really awful. In fact, it's so terrible that I have to look at it all just to be convinced (!). During this I realized that it reminds me of a lot of Danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. The pattern is as follows: Take one extremely popular comedian, make a script that makes this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible instead, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners) and decorate it with some beautiful young girls - movie, and you have a success! I will not know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that has become silent (with some great comedians), it seems there is a market for this kind of film in the US.
