Honestly, I don't know what is more beautiful, this horrible remake or the commentary on this board. Masterpiece's review had me in tears, it's so funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst movies ever, and definitely the bottom of the run for prosecutions. The Omen name on the title has stopped me and watched it on HBO this morning, but it is a slap in the face of the other three, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite is the guy who escapes the juggler on the psychic shoulder! good times! This movie is for the Omen series that is "Scary Movie" for the whole genre. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
