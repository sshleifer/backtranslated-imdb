Guy walks without motive ... I'll never get those two hours of my life back. The man continued to accept identities and fraud on his pregnant wife. What did I think? How did it win a prize anywhere? I understood he loved his father, but otherwise the movie was completely meaningless to me. What was the purpose of walking so much and for a clear reason to go to the funeral of a stranger. How did it enrich his life ??? Why did we see the dying old lady on her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> But I'll be deep or something more interesting. I don't even recommend the movie to go up while you sleep ...
