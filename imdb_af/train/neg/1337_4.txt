Yes, you guessed it. Another movie where identical twins switch places. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older, they must try to make the plot less predictable and less like a complete home of a new home. If you plan to watch this movie, don't do it. Instead of 'The Parent Trap'. It's more entertaining.
