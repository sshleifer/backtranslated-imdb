Sorry, but besides Kim Basinger doing a good job that was scared, it was one of the worst thrills I've seen in a while. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside of a busy shopping center and then shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to be seeing. Then, instead of shouting for help or driving back to the mall, she drives off and ends in the middle of the forest with the guys in the pursuit. I can't even describe how stupid it is that this woman of 4 disadvantaged boyfriends flew, wearing a red toolbox, and shouting to God to help her, and then having sex with one of them after they brutally murdered others . Please believe me, it is bad and also tasteless.
