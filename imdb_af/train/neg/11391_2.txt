When I first watched the movie, I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphor, but I soon saw that this movie was about people on a train. The interactions between people are like those you can see on the street any day and when there is a bit more interesting situation, the dialogue becomes silent and boring. It's not that I don't understand how this movie is trying to portray the way people interact, it's just that it's very boring in this movie. If you want to see and analyze this kind of relationship, you will be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train. It's realistic, but you won't go to a movie to watch a movie about you sitting there watching the movie.
