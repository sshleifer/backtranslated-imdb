This silly, indisputable story is only delivered by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some almost audible lines confirming our greatest fears. He's dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director forfeited the brilliant force of A. Martinez in favor of this sad anonymous actor who filled the screen for a short moment. The fact that an unknown hack from the street can save such a dish water film is no less likely than a villain who commits murder by dropping stones in a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; His promise is great. Perhaps through this dark nail, we will be treated at more screen time if there is ever a sequel to this unsaturated film.
