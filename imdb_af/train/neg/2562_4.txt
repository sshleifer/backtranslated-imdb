Let me start by saying this movie has a funny point at the beginning of the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who are you? George: My new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: New George, just happy, I think. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only funny part in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... But then again, I'm easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen not (the title goes to the terribly unruly Disaster Movie ...). This movie falls # 7 on my bottom 15 list ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small kid that is easily entertained, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a movie keeper who wants a good, funny movie, you will eventually shoot halfway through this one.
