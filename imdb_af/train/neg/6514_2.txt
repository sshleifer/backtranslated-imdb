The film attempts to be a mockumentary - shot in documentary form, but with many clearly written parts - but fails to provide the public with characters that can create the illusion of the mockumentary. The film also aims to find true love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur movie maker trying to make its first "big movie".
