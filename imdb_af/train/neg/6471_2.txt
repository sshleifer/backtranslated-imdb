This is a movie that is bad in every way possible. Certainly, we want to know what happened 12 years from the previous movie and it works at some level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is terrible! Unfortunately, while the logic that people cannot keep forever underwater, it is maintained. Other basic physical logic is ignored. It's cold if you don't have cold weather when you're in the Arctic. I don't know why most comments here return from Jafar rates worse, I thought this one was more horrible.
