OK, probably, honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It had absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no acting, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I first saw, May 28, 2003 ** Warning, it's a spoiler warning. It's also a lot of me to complain about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> So the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there is no character explanation. as far as i knew the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. It also turned out that he had lived himself ... then he was a foster child ... then his mother was an angry alcoholic who still lived with him. even though his friends apparently had no parents and lived independently. <br /> <br /> Now we come to a main graphical point, this insane man broke out of the mad asylum and ran running. Now our main character is obsessed with this man and focuses on him on the need for the movie. I think I had missed a main plot element here, there was no reason for the main character to get stuck. even if that's the point, for no reason, why do all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues and it gets all right. they are ruined at school, blah blah. but wait a moment ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is performing the show here. Wait a minute, did the madman not specifically tell the main character to do it? It was supposed to be anomalous. <br /> <br /> Another important plate element was skipped ... the madman didn't have to be mad ... everyone said he wasn't mad. but as the story goes on, he is very clear from his heart. but I thought the news people said he wasn't ... hm ... <br /> <br /> now the movie is over. THAT WAS THE CLOSE? WHAT DOES THIS HELL? Not only did the end not answer any questions about the main character, it did not answer any questions about the madman. Are these people in the same situation? If so, then there are some very basic story lines that are not prone to this. if no, what is the point to say, "You're in two weeks?" <br /> <br /> * End of the thing ... * <br /> <br /> That's what I thought. That's pretty much what I'm thinking now. It's been six months, and if I can get it for free, I can give it another chance, but I doubt it. I doubt it very much.
