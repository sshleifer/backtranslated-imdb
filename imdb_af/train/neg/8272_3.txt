At the end of the "Dragon Heat" everything I could think of was why I was bothering the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The performance of the movie is interesting and it - and Maggie Q - is the one who lured me. to the movie in the first place. But I was ever disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee can't hold a candle like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use the phrase unbelievably - that he fills the movie with completely unnecessary black and white stills, freezing frames, slow motion, fast movement and other visual nonsense. I suspect he did everything to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and play like a made-up music video more than anything else. There is little caring for any of the characters - including two so-called professional snipers that can't hit the wide side of a barn! - which is then loaded with some of the baldest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is undoubtedly and swirling - from the initial set-up, everything unfolds into predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to remind us of the characters' storytelling if we don't turn it on for the first time . It is terribly amateurish writing and film processing and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although I am honest, I find it difficult to remember Biehn in any good movie not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a great Hong Kong action, you're much better off holding some of the staples. John Woo's The Killer (1989) and Hard-Boiled (1992), Ringo Lam's "City on Fire" (1987) - Quentin Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs (1992) - or his "Point Blank" (1967) , "Full Contact" (1992). Or even look at Yuen's "So Close" (2002), a highly entertaining but preposterous, popcorn movie. And there is always the tremendous French police action, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> Wherever most, if not all, is a bit top-notch, but they were thrilling, exciting and even exciting movies. They have characters that care and act wisely. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat, on the other hand, is just terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee didn't make a bad action movie, he made a dull one.
