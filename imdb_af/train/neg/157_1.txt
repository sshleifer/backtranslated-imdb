OK, first of all, it looks like it was filmed in the 80's. I was shocked to find out that it was released in 2001. Secondly, the plot was all over the place, the story was confusing. If there was a short presentation or introduction, the story would have been better. I also appreciate fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes didn't flow at all and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow and maybe it was the translation, but it was even difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you are looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I would recommend the promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development), not this movie. Beware, you will be disappointed.
