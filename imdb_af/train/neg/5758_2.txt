You can say that the actors will make a movie, but it clearly shows that the statement is wrong. Most characters in this movie have nothing to keep. They play the part of cardboard cuttings that are shifted in predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It can be summed up in a few words, but I will hold back if someone who reads wants to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to pass those sections where Jack showed us how to potty eat. I have to say that 70% of this movie spins around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. Honestly, I'd rather not spend my time watching Jack listen to an open mouth. Personally I could have done without the shoe references and jokes also peppered the first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> Outside my own personal dementia, the movie really did nothing. There were numerous scenes and camera shots that felt dragged. When something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It is better not to look at this one.
