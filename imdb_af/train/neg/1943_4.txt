What a lie! It started with an intriguing secret and interesting characters. Although it moved at the speed of a snail, I was still gripped and watched. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always good value and he has a good lead over Suranne Jones. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We are armored with possible terrorist ties. <br /> <br /> But then Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring and boring. The whole thing seems to be very small beer and the refurbishment was incredibly poor. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for it? My advice: look paint dry instead.
