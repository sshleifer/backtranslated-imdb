Now I haven't read the original short story to get to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going down here. <br /> <br /> But I have learned for some time that Stephen King's movie is simple - non-horror movies, with some exceptions. It wasn't one of them. It started well enough, and for once I won't complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful. Also, I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as it was necessary to move the story here ... <br /> <br /> But there was one consistent point I couldn't help but I was irritated. And it came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters participated in the stupid stupidity activity. The moments I refer to are: There is a small zombie running around the house. You suspect it's under the bed. Do you <br /> <br /> (a) as close to the bed as you can before blindly increasing the duvet cover and exposing your entire body to any damage that can cause such a weed cannibal to you , or <br /> <br /> (b) move a little away from the bed so you can sit under the completely open end of a slightly elevated position of safety, or at least see the mini-terror at you come, give you some reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel the victim today. Stay <br /> <br /> Fun enough movie all ... Just not very scary.
