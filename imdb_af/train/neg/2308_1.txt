OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg stands beside Danny Glover who parodies the famous farmer and his wife's painting. Then you pop this baby into the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. Must be a comedy. And I must admit I once laughed about ten minutes before the end. This movie has the following elements: An abused and abused neighbor, a boring legal trial, racism, talk of lynchings, and death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, if you never listen to someone's reviews, please do here. You can't even force this crap to look. CRAP! I said it, CRAP! Anyone who names this must indeed sue.
