It's not really a proper review, as I haven't seen most of the movie. I stopped watching. The film is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street dots, but that's not why I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem: I just watched enough to introduce several characters, all of whom were not interesting. Everyone was a boring, despicable psychopath, with no engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look forward to. I don't have the least bit of curiosity about what they would do next or what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> If even one person was interested, and I don't mean good or beautiful person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. See "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In this movie, the Gary Oldman character is a complete madman, but he is * very * interesting. Already Pacino might have done a good job in Scarface, but his character just didn't address me.
