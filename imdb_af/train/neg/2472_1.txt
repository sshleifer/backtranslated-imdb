Anyone who actually had the ability to sit and walk through this movie, feels like a good movie, doesn't appreciate quality movies. This movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school movie class quality as well as cinematography. The Blair Witch Project has better filmmaking and I hate that move with a passion! The storyline has the potential to be a very intense, very good movie, but it fell flat through the rest of the movie for the first 10 minutes. Someone mentioned that this film is about a child's imagination, okay it's good and good. But they could have done even better things with this writing than they did. I mean, the Indian comes in the store. Did the child look at the little idol and suddenly present the Indian and the whole story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? What they call the shopkeeper and she says incidentally there is no one except me who works here, so you think everybody's uncomfortable ghost scenario, but then she just smells for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little child this man see. . It was so lame, it goes beyond pathetic. The end has surprised you, not just what happened to Otis in hospital, but also with the sense of OMG !!! Why the hell I just wasted my time! It's a move I recommend not to watch, there are definitely better quality movies out there that will not offend your intelligence! Thanks, I never paid to see this movie, I would have claimed my money back! For those who are easily entertained by this movie .... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of movie entertainment to actually say it was a good movie.
