It was the worst activated movie I've ever seen in my life. No really. I'm not joking. All that "based on a true story / historical reference" aside, there is no excuse for such bad acting. It is a pity, because, like others, the sets and costumes were large. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was typical "Asian style" music, although I couldn't figure out where the "modern" Love song came when Fernando was lying in his bed and thinking of Maria. I don't know who wrote and sang the beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones was suddenly transported to the 1500's. <br /> <br /> The Hershey poaching blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup produced during the Mercury n-EZ screens. <br /> <br /> But the play. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines rendered like a bad junior high play. If Gary Stretch had a potato costume for the County 4H, he might be more credible. By the end he sounded more like a Little Italy street thief. Sometimes I expected half of him to "Adrian!" Shouting. or even "You want a piece of mine?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen tells her lover, "I'm going to have a baby." He responds to a child? I expected her to return "No, jackass, a stool! Duh."
