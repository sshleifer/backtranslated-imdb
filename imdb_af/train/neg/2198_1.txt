A scientist and his girlfriend are driving when his speed causes a car accident. He escaped unharmed, but she was beheaded. He saves her head, brings it to his house and keeps it alive (!!!!). He then continues to look for models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant looks over the head that starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathic) link to a distorted sample held in the cabinet. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's pretty stupid, but I had some love for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local TV station showed this movie about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They always showed TV on Saturday afternoon - unmoved. Watch it on TV and then it was wonderful! Explicit blood and gore with a horrible monster and messy gender exposure - who cares if it was good? If I see it now, I realize how common it is. <br /> <br /> The acting is completely miserable, the production values ​​are non-existent, the writing is pretty stupid and (besides the rather disgusting gore) it is boring stuff. There is also a soft cat fight between two women and the great monster at the end. Also, put an end to tons of loose points. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation movie. On the other hand, it's totally trash. Anyway, it's not a good movie, but is a must-see (for once) horror and gore fans. <br /> <br /> The head's laugh is pretty scary. Note the end credits that the TITLE gets wrong (call it "The Head Who Wouldn't Die")!
