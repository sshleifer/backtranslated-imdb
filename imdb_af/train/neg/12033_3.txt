Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. New family moves in, calling the excess dialogue, mediocre acting, green jello salad with carved roots, and every other "in-Mormon joke" known to men. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will find this movie difficult. Anyone in the Mormon culture will be slightly amused here and there. You'd better look at Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than to try this one. The acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has his hands on many more quality films such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend both movies about this groaner.
