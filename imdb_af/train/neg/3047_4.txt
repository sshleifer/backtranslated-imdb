I saw this movie many times in the late 60's / early 70's when it raised. It was like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matinee kiddie show. It was always stiff competition for the Christmas that was not (oops - I can say "Christmas"?), Perhaps the biggest, most iconic Christmas season movie of all time. But it's another review. <br /> <br /> Then I marveled that the SANTA CLAUS screen tone was almost "pink and white", so much has the color of the chain-torn prints changing color. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit creepy! I thought so - and still, actually. I was very entertained when I was still! It's amusing in a "retarted-eleven" kind of way. By the way, the picture quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than in the theater, about 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you expect the lost RANKIN BASS Christmas Specialist, forget about it! If you want FELLINI DOING CHRISTMAS - read more ... <br /> <br /> Of course, duplication of these foreign films (the original version here in Spanish) is always "bad". It also adds to the film's inherent strangeness. It's also quite scary because a "naughty demon" (as described in the original American trailer) uses the whole movie to try to "make" decent children. One particular nightmare scene has a young "a boy who wishes he had parents for Christmas. Suddenly the" port-a-family "appears from giant" Christmas gifts-of-the-spirit "until he realizes he is just daydream See it, Christmas lovers - and if you're a stoner, save your stash - this movie will make you think you're hallucinating ... without drugs!
