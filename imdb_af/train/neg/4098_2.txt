Although it's better than the first Mulva (which doesn't say much, I'd rather see paint dry) it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these Low Budget Pictures guys. I was suckered into buying some DVDs to support some indie filmmakers and boy did I regret it. Some have not yet been officially "released" (not self-loading from the filmmakers themselves) and I can't even figure out how bad they are. Avoid anything with Teen Monkeys or Bonejack in them as they appear in other little indie movies with which they are friends. If you are friends of these guys, chances are you were in their movies and made it fun. But for those they had to see? Not at all. Bad video, bad sound, bad acting, bad plot ... etc. It's not even funny. I gave this one just 2 because Debbie Rochon is in it and it's about it. Maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2. To show a 1 / 16th star, it was slightly better than the first (which I wish I could have classified in the negative). If you want a decent no budget movie, get something from LBP's "friends" at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. This is actually decent.
