One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obliged to express even the least pleasant films in the TCM library, as it would explain to him that he was extinguishing the "virtues" of this "charming" film during his introduction I saw it on cable TV. As an old movie on IMDb received a classic status from a number of recipient reviewers, I thought there was an urgent need for an honest review of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not your dad's 'Shop around the corner'. For all my quibbles with 'You've Got Mail', it's still being remake in just about every imaginable way. For those who have seen the original, the mistakes will only be clearer. <br /> <br /> From one of the lambs Meet fun rows I can remember seeing (a sad lapstick attempt at humor), this movie is on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. These 'musical' qualify only as one in the least sense of the term. There is a sprinkling of instantly forgotten musical numbers and then Judy sings: "I don't mind" as she flies her arms around as if it's in a seizure. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here. Miss. Garland was wonderful in a number of music films, but here it looks terribly bad. The role was originally filled in June. Allyson and Judy are definitely not able to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan's old part. Van Johnson is also in a rather dim performance as a second-class Jimmy Stewart type. The leaders never reach Stewart / Sullavan's chemistry or even that of Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that knows the (some of) the notes but not the music. It doesn't really matter why the original worked and even felt the need to add another possible love interest to Van Johnson's character to make things unnecessary. The remake's replacement of the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device with a valuable violin. It is almost embarrassing to look and feel as though it was being lifted from an episode by Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flow monitor. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton talk. Even the great resolution scene between the romantic leads is being abused. After watching both movies, you'll understand why they called it the 'Lubitsch Touch' and NOT the 'Robert Z. Leonard Touch'. <br /> <br /> Avoid it and revisit the original movie or one of Judy Garland's earlier films unless you are an iconoclast who likes to see a once-off star falling on the Earth.
