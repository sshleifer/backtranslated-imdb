Although THE FLOCK did a bit of good by veteran Richard Gere, and some good photos that might return the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days, the film draws credibility to the breaking point and destroys it against a plot that goes nowhere . br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) working for the Department of Security and is preparing to retire. His office pushes him his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his work. And that job is not much fun. He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are parole in his jurisdiction. Allison calls Erroll on many calls to look at his "herd" of offenders and learns that he has desperate need for retirement. But Erroll is good at his job, even if his methods aren't. He attacks sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by picking up the descendants of these apostates. It is this "good justification" that challenges the audience on one level or another, and shows us how cruel Erroll is and how out-of-touch he has become (too close to his work). <br /> <br /> When a teenage girl in Erroll's "area" is missing, she immediately concludes that she has been abducted by one of his herds. But how can he know? Is Erroll so good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll returns. Their battles are as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl. <br /> <br /> Although the storyline was good, it didn't have umpf! However, I will give Richard Gere credit, which plays the Erroll character very well. Struggling retirement. Worried about everyone who is near his flock. Disgusted with those responsible for supervision. Mess with himself because he has to do something he does. Totally a change in character representation for Gere. But above him there is not much else. Some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous), but there are so many other problems than being ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that suspicious disbelief is a requirement when watching movies. But the suspension has limits. The biggest push against the limits is the destruction of extremely important crime scenes. Someone as accurate as Erroll will know that moving a body will be a great no-no. Or trampled by a crime scene. Or move evidence. It went further and hit the film to no end. <br /> <br /> The other harmful part of this movie is that we never enter Clair Danes' character, Allison. She is almost dropped on the side of the movie and we are never busy with what her intention is: Will she stay or leave? Will she eventually end up like Erroll if she stays? This is not a horrible movie, as it touches on an awkward moral ground, but the story as a whole must be strengthened.
