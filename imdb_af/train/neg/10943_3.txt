It's a very bad movie, with a bad play and a very boring fit. However, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters are just annoying (except Lamas), and there is absolutely no one to root or care about, plus the action is very boring. The movie gives us 3 villains who were supposed to be threatening and disturbing if it was actually boring, laughing and just a bunch of morons I wanted to lock! And it looks very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can't save this piece of shit, and believe it or not, the opening was really cool, just like the end, but the waist is incredibly boring and has the urge to push the fast forward button! Plus the dialogue is especially laughing! There is a cool bar scene I really liked, but once Lamas goes to the cabin, it falls apart, plus the scene where the villains kill Jennifer's family and kill them. It would be disturbing if it was actually laughable! It's a very bad movie, with a bad play and a very boring fit, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool, though not enough, is not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, working with a mediocre camera, barefoot, and keeping the movie in a boring fit. The act is pretty bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is wonderful here, and while he should not act, he is quite fun to watch, and he has a very cool character and has a lot of charisma, but even he cannot save this one and he has no chemistry with the cast! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is horrible here, and while she looks decent, she is not very convincing and has no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is warm but doesn't have much to do, but screams and scares. She did it well. Robert Scott is unfairly annoying as the chief villain, and was not threatened at all, he was laughing like the other 2. The rest of the role is bad. Overall Avoid! Avoid! Even if you like Lamas (like me). * out of 5
