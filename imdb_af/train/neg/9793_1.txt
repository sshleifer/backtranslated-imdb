Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst television program ever made. There is no plot, just a bunch of silly, dressed children using martial arts, while wearing second-class spandex outfits. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like they are from the 70's, the costumes look like something <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the television program is the toys, but the second Class plastic garbage given to our children. <br /> <br /> There are much better performances for your kids to watch! <br /> <br /> Try to give your kids something like Nickelodean, these shows actually have intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers.
