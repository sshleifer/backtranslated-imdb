This film is a travesty and is not suitable for keeping the company with the superior original. The plot is an absolute mess, and the movie is far too long. Each time they struggle, they desperately spray a sentimental memory from the first movie. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the top 10 British movies of all time. This one is terrible.
