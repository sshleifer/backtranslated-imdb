All I can say after looking at Snitch'd is please Cahill to stop. It is painfully clear that you have no understanding of what you are filming about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters, I ask you to do research. It's funny to see movies with absurd gangsters who sound even more absurd when they talk. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the side. Cahill goes to school with only 3 students and continues to build a king-kicking fashion. This movie was tough as a post-school special. Who had the idea to wear hats that say where a particular gangster comes from? I suspect real gangsters do not wear hats that demand gangs. It would be silly considering new laws that add length to a prison sentence if a person is gang-related. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made.
