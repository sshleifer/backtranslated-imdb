Contains decay The film plot can be summed up in a few sentences: Three guys are hunting in the forest. Two of them are shot next to other people in the head without explanation. The last man can stand in the clear, scream and do anything without being shot. He gets through an old factory and the evil people run without his fight right into his work. The villains are comfortably dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> It's the whole story, not summed up, but in detail. Everything is pulled out with a man ringing a doorbell. We're waiting with him. Long shot of guys get bored in the bush and sleep. We can take a nap with them. The one who pulled out to follow a female jogger could have been redemption if we could reflect her buttocks or boobs. <br /> <br /> That dialogue is less than Terminator and that's not because there is so much action. The characters just don't speak. And then they don't even have a crown to say like "I'll be back." If my friend shot it this weekend, I'll have the courage, because it's quite a thing to find out the camera controls. Paying money to rent it as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The one thing a little funny is the extra that the director tells, how local police didn't realize they were shooting and treating them like a random man with a gun running around. If they filmed it, I would be sure it would be better to watch the movie.
