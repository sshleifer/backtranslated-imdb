A beloved American family, living in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little do they know that this ghost town once was a testing ground for nuclear bombs and a deadly presence stole them. I usually like mystery horror movies like this. "Cube", Spielberg's Duel and Birds are all good examples of movies that give no answers, but we leave our intrigues and wants more. Apparently, "Disappearance" writer / director Walter Klenhard tried to make just that kind of movie, and whether he was both successful, is up to the viewer. Personally, I think he's about halfway there, then the movie just sank. <br /> <br /> The actors are all kind of just "ho-hum". They are not very bad, but we as an audience never feel their fear and respond to situations in unrealistic ways. Is anyone else absolutely SIK characters who just run out to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least they give some kind of justification to do it!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As far as TV films are concerned, it's a top average fair. Director Klenhard must be commended for the truly milking of the desert environment for all that it has presented and the environment was striking. There is a very cool scene where two characters get an old core test ground, where the sand is completely melted for glass as far as the eye can see. I wonder if it really was? <br /> <br /> No gore to talk about, and the "creatures" ?? or how hell this is to these people is never shown, not to mention we are never even given a real idea of ​​what they are (Mutants, strangers, ghosts or ancient evil spirits? O, it really cuts us off!) or where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There are also many clicks here. Why is it that towns in these movies are really stupid? Why is there always an old guy who thinks it is crazy what seems to be? Why? Why? Why? How a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" is trying differently and intelligently, but ultimately fails to be known in many ways to our fans of direct-to-video horror fever. Hey, I've seen a lot worse movies, and disappearance isn't bad, it's just too ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
