First of all, I'm not easily scared ... Anything but for my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. It is not suitable for children! I opened my mouth all the time. It just shocked me. I couldn't believe how crazy it was for a children's movie, while the bunnies were brutally murdered! It is just unnecessary to be so horrible and to be G. I recommend being more than 8 to see it. But don't get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I wasn't mentally like a child. I can't believe a parent will allow a 4-year-old child to see it. It's just too intense and complicated, not to forget, for young children. I'm over 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend it
