Even if it was just funny, this crazy movie waxwork would still be negligent. Just stop short of digging the boys' bodies and reviewing 'Weekend at Bernie's'? but not just ?? producer Larry Harmon and director of the frickin '' Ernest 'films use the copyright as an excuse to rape everything about Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does an honest Ollie personalization, but Bronson Pinchot won't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike match; even if they were both on the film, it would be no less horrible. The less said about the surrounding disaster, the better. Make 'Utopia' like a worthy swan song.
