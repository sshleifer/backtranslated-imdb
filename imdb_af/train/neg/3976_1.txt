The plot was boring, the girls were sick and the so-called Italian male head had never heard an Italian accent. Some said the boys were cute in this movie, but it just looked like mediocre people. There was literally no redeeming feature on this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is a cemetery for actors who will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who, for people who do not seem to have a clear cause to fascinate people . <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the way to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
