Look for a few years or so. I've never been moved to place here, so maybe this movie is worth it, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD because I missed it in the movies because of illness and never came around to watch it until now. I didn't expand on reading it, probably not even thinking about the movie in a few months. That was exactly what the buddy picked up in the store, so it looked. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The shot I was talking about in the summary at the top of the trailer and the poster. From then on, Jason Statham has hair. Like no other GR movie. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities shown here. And Ray Liotta in underpants must be warned beforehand. It's scary and funny, but not in a ha-ha humor way. It's more in an almost-TheOffice-but-slightly-muted-and-so-failed-kind-of-humor way. They all say the same: "This movie is not like anything you expect from this movie." <br /> <br /> Now, based on past, extensive, cinematic experience, I expected this movie to be a few things. Like: <br /> <br /> () Coherent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () Not a complete and complete farrago of nail look, < br /> <br /> Something more substantive than a foolish bunch of poorly realized fables that are just a standard oriental mystic ideology dressed as a "cool, modern, self-conscious art form", <br /> <br /> () Hopefully better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed, it has failed to check any box above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Poor editing {watch over the store, 70s amateur high-8 style jumping cuts, incomprehensible "" plot! through chopped flash-back settings, I can go on ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shoot as if by a depressed 14-year-old goth who just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with the curtains drawn <br /> <br /> (x) So its own back with the whole "I'm very clever, I" motive / message, it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that the stupid people (ie anyone who doesn't like it) in the audience make sure they get the point. <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> As to the undisputed ability of some people to get some of this, well. I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster said something that caught my attention: under 25 it probably understood better because of the editing. Maybe, but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible, no less. As the "Genius is only recognized by the enlightened" brigade, an onion will suck and grow up. There is nothing more presumptuous and self-service than people who say why another person does not know good art is because they do not understand the 'craft / material / lunar cycle / filaments of highest rational thinking', which the author / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant 'explain his or her vision / grand scheme / unit with Gaea / big big bucket of dog disease. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, his garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, anything designed to be viewed by another person is supposed to get involved and move. In one way or another it is metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you have. <br /> <br /> The only way I was moving was ahead of time, two hours closer to my own inevitable downfall. "The biggest trick he ever pulled was to make you believe. Any part of this movie meant everything to everyone. <br /> <br /> And now, please.
