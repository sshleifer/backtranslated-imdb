It's really a horrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is at the same time thin and abusive, with nudity and much violence. The nudity, however, is not so exciting, and the violence is repetitive and dull. The plot is also in its best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's not. I didn't even laugh while I watched it, and I didn't even smile. The creators of this movie have tried to combine a comedy film with an action movie, and they both failed. <br /> <br /> Some weak movies are funny because they are so bad, but not one of them.
