It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing positive about it. Some of you guys really like this movie! I saw many Dracula movies and I loved everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie, I told myself, "What is hell?" What a silly movie. Now they have become Dracula who he is because he is Judas. For those who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty that he was hanging himself. You gotta joke me. That's the dumbest reason I've ever heard why Dracula got angry. Who in any case asked a reason? What a piece of this movie is. Who has been sorry about this, must be hit by a movie. Even the Dracula is terrible. If you ever saw this movie, you wouldn't even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should the title impress me? Don't waste your time or money on this trash.
