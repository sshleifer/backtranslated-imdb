I'm glad the people at IMDb were able to decipher what genre this movie is about. I suspected it was a comedy, but because it also wanted to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I wasn't sure. For a comedy it is incredibly robbed of even the slightest gamble in the field of humor - up to the ridiculous "twist" end, which confirms what a total waste of time the whole movie is actually. It's just hard to describe how amateurish the DANGER really is. Did anyone involved in this movie have any idea of ​​what they were supposed to do? Actually, it's worth watching so you can stare on the screen in the unfortunate disbelief about how terrible it is.
