If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, there is apparently a movie called 'Reload' in production (from June '08) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever make a successor ... and secondly, Sebastian didn't kill at the end of the "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I watched it in the early hours when I was struggling with insomnia, and so I was driving in and out while it was on. I'm sure I've missed a few plot points, but overall it looks very poor. Groot's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people who comment on the beautiful girls, as I thought Brooke's actress was beautiful but not exceptional.
