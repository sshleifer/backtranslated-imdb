Do we think of the same movie? This movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. It's a typical straightforward DVD / TV movie that contains all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience. Overworking doors are actors, side steps from the plot that are left inexplicable. THE GIRL SHOWS HIS T * ts (why, god, why?), People do not respond to things as they would in real life. I won't even bother you with details, it'll take all night. Well, okay, just one: If two people were murdered in front of you while walking down the street, one of the victims dies almost in your arms, his blood comes from his head wound over you, your first concern will be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
