It is hard to believe that David Duchovny was aware of his fame in 1997, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever on top of the glory. Nine years later, he was almost forgotten, and his tentative to make it on the big screen failed. I can't even explain why he's a fair actor, but probably his moment of celebrity has cast him into an eternal role that breaks great talent. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less known. , and she was very happy that a movie such as 'Playing God' did not end her career. Fortunately, her 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl Interrupted' waited outside the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was launched. <br /> <br /> There's not too much to tell about this. film. This is Andy Wilson's only big screen movie, and there has to be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what is happening on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar just trying to work for the crowd. The off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shadow of cinematographic experience of the movie. You probably won't find the movie, but in DVD rental stores, or on TV. Try to look for something better.
