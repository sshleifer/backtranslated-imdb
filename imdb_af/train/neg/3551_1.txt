This movie is just awful !!!! Slow acting, slow to reach and timber characters who just didn't have to be there. The best part was the performance of Iron Maiden in a video at a theater, and that's it. the end was worth watching and waiting for it to be !! The characters in this movie almost slept me. Avoid it !!!
