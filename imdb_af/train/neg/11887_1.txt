The world may have ended. Unfortunately, this movie survived as another test for Canada's inability to make movies that go beyond the excrement. Maybe that's because all of our very good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short et al) go to Hollywood.) It's actually too bad. Short was not thrown into this far-reaching pretentious and banal movie. He may have given it credibility. The Canadian government must realize --- and this movie is a great example --- moving money into the trough does not lead to good cinema. If the emerging people had to compete with these public funds, they might have been forced to do something worthwhile. As it is, they have produced another sneaking embarrassment.
