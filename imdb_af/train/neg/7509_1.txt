"Why?" <br /> <br /> The simple question had to be on every New Yorker's lips during the 12-month terror created by David Berkowitz in 1976-77. The same one word will certainly be the same confusing question 22 summers later as people leave the theaters and exhibit the "Summer of Sam". <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee seeks to find the story of a packet of deceived thugs looking for the celebrated psychopath - more than a year of paralyzed New York City - with a sharp and graphic representation of the murders, demons in Berkowitz's head and the frustration of a futile NYPD manhunt. He offers an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own "barking dogs" while they live, without love, honor and humanity, unlike Berkowitz. Lee browses the audience in almost every frame with "none of us being what we look like". He is often a critic of the white establishment. Lee maintains the stereotype by including a scene where Mira Sorvino, a young man with a fake man (John Leguizamo) plays, hopes to have oral sex with a black man "in the back of a big black Cadillac ". An Italian Mafioso tells a black detective that catching the well-known Willie Mays' over-the-back midfield was "happy". Lee even makes sure the racist mockery of a black woman in the middle of the year states: "I'm glad it's a white man who kills all these whites, because if it's a black man already killing these whites, there is the biggest riot in NYC history. Welles 'The Third Man', this movie has no soul, purpose or passion. He deprived parades of characters on the screen of human decency. Although we learn nothing about the true victims of this terrible spree, it seems that Spike Lee says that New York City has earned it during that frightening, boiling summer over two decades ago. <br /> <br /> "How can someone give revenge such destruction on his beloved city?" "How can one show such hatred to his fellow man?" <br /> <br /> Are these appropriate questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
