... then you better not watch this movie. They completely destroyed the prospect of the show. In the movie the Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos is so close. <br /> <br /> At one point they open the doors to get into General Lee. Nuff said. <br /> <br /> The original show may not be big TV. but it was entertaining and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets the Simple Life.
