This movie was absolutely pathetic. A spicy screenplay and a lack of a story just showed me that three losers are wandering about bikini kids. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappointed, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley wasn't bad. The only valuable part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession with Shayaris. It was rather hilarious. The songs "Sini Ne" and the remix version were really good. You can always rely on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, Emran doesn't seem to have a good Bhatts writing to stop him.
