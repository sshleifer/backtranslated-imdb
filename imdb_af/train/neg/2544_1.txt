Gung Ho was a good idea, but it's too much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of US work and foreign competition. In this movie, the main character, Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese car company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town. Two things come to you. First, why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do, and so well with them? Secondly, anyone can understand that American companies from all sorts to third world nations are making their products to escape US labor costs? This makes the film's prospect that the number one manufacturer of cars in the world will go to one of its best competitors (except Germany) and set a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy by this time. But he does give a credible performance the same as he can prove he can go to drama in a matter of seconds from comedy and not be ashamed, but director Ron Howard doesn't like being a TV movie. Anyway, because they have to give the unlikely story, a happy ending to politics and problems of Japanese and American relations. Gung Ho has a happy day and Laverne and Shirley feel as if the producers of both TV shows have made the film and then made the TV version of this movie that gives the film a light feel. The Japanese driver loves his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learn from the Americans. His No.2 man, Saito, who apparently doesn't like Americans, thinks so much. I would have preferred all the Japanese characters like Saito as the soft goofball to be the characters they made the Japanese. That would have made the movie more interesting.
