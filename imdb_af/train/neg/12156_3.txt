Jesus Christ, I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I just watched because I have such a loved one on Jordan Ladd. But look at this movie, almost pushed me off her. It's absolutely horrible! I could watch Survivor Series 93 about this. <br /> <br /> The chief in this was so dirty and generic. I would love it if the big Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove had flown his ass through a glass frame. I was furious every time he said "more" and "cabin". I'll kick his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she can't even save the full joke of a movie. Unfortunately, she can't even act like she was from her nut when she took those truths. It looks hilaries. <br /> <br /> I also loved the little thing that Jordan accidentally threw on her. It reminded me of a time when ... never. <br /> <br /> Anayways, look at this movie because of its horror.
