I saw some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so horrible, so NO, that I looked about halfway and couldn't see the rest. Pity. Exciting talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story of John Grisham, which went wrong? Branagh is a great-time lawyer who flies a one-night flight with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hung her cat, etc. So Branagh sent him to a rhinoceros, and he escaped quickly. Somehow (I couldn't figure out how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed up in the slow-moving story. I wanted to like this, and, as a great Grisham fan, everything read about this movie and I (foolishly) expected something interesting. It is honestly the WORST movie I have seen so far and I wish I could refund my money. * From *****.
