This inferior successor based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) relates to a marriage called Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They take a little girl named Delia from a monastery. Gene York on the re-election of the congressman and he is the chairman of the finance committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be when inexplicable deaths occur. She creates devastation when a metaphysical bursary goes, as shops of numerology, therapy, counseling health, yoga, tarot, are destroyed. Karen York hires an eye-private (Michael Lerner) to investigate the strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequel shows excitement, cold fever, flu events and gory kills. Delia, like Damien, seems to be sending out murder every few minutes. The great excitement lies in looking at what new and innocent victim can be made through special effects. In addition, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, were a gunman, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S Davis. As always, excellent musical score of Omen I and III taken by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The movie is exclusively for hardcore followers Omen saga. The film is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Previous and much better versions are the following: The excessively original 'Omen' (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; 'Final conflict' (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Evaluation: Below average.
