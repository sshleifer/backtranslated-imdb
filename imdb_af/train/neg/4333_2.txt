Quote: theurgist: Anyone with an I.Q. more than 50 would have seen this movie what it is, an intelligent, well-known prequel for a contemporary classic, yes, it does not have a big role or a big budget, but it is still very well done and has chopped me for the full duration <br /> <br /> An IQ Over 50 says you. It usually means that you have an IQ. lower than 50 .. his name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! which means it must have something that the first one should do. <br /> <br /> all its an OK movie than ... YOU CHANGE THE TITLE AND NO FEATURES NAME CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps comments not on a movie if you don't know about movies. but I think an I.Q. Under 50, you don't know what the hell I'm screaming for. <br /> <br /> Peace!
