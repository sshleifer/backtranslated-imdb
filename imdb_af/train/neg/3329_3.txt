Take your basic Frankenstein movie, spray some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Certainly, it was, of course, inspired by the aforementioned films, but it is never realized as something special in itself. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place in the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut off body parts from some women who are stranded, and coincidentally decide to stay at his place at night. <br /> <br /> I can't really say the acting is bad. and not directing. Everything here is just too standard. What little effort there is on humor actually works (look at the scene if Hackenstein is hiding behind his deaf assistant, as she will undoubtedly be very upset if she sees how a woman and a needle are trapped), but it's rare enough to recommend this movie. The music is decent, what blood is, is decent, and the throw looks pretty good. And for half the time, I was even entertained by this movie. But I never felt that it was anything more than a time warmer. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker.
