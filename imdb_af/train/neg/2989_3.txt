Although the chance of someone commenting on this comment under the other 80+, this movie is low, I feel I should say something about this one. I'm not the kind of movie watcher that pays attention to production value, thoughtful dialogue or brilliant acting. However, I claim this movie sucks. I don't know why I don't like it. I mean it has almost everything I want from a horror movie: blood, cruelty, inadvertent humor, etc. According to this evidence, it should be my favorite. Yet Zombi 3 is a bath movie. <br /> <br /> There are just too many things that force you to scream on the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army when their car breaks down to find water (it wastes nothing so don't worry). She walks into what I see as a deserted hotel or something. Didn't she see that there was a friggin lake in the middle of the building? Yes she is looking for water and succeeds. Why? Cuz she wants to know why the people (who are not there, leaving the place) will not answer her when she exclaims: "Is there anyone there?" Oh, it's just a tiny, insignificant piece of the big picture I paint. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a reason why I gave this movie more than 1 star. This is one of those movies. If you forget how bad it really is, as I have several times, you will want to see it again, because it is just like that in every aspect. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore. In addition, it also has very strange creatures: a zombie baby (with an adult hand ???) and a magic-flying head to name just two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you're trying to think of the worst and cutest movies ever made and come up with a 50-year-old sci-fi movie? I believe that Zombi 3 and movies should be like it. It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting monsters, and so on. This is the Plan 9 of the 80's! While I won't say it's a waste of money if you want to buy it, you just expect the worst. And if you find out that the worst is the worst, underestimate Zombi 3, it won't be that bad. You might like it, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Don't think I hate this movie, I don't ... really. O, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! (Did I just blow my credibility?)
