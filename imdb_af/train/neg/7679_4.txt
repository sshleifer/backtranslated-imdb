Snow White, who just came out in Locarno, where I had the chance to see it, obviously refers to the world-famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays its part. <br /> <br /> All three aspects of the title are addressed in this movie. There are many baptisms on the scene, and there is also a pale, dark-haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kinds of trouble to save her. <br /> <br /> But: It's not a fairy tale. It is supposed to be a realistic drama in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the Tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is close to perfect. Unfortunately, a poor plot, predictable dialogues, a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed play do not add up to authenticity. So as a spectator I stayed untouched. <br /> <br /> Then there were the cliches that made me one crazy one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled top girl. Of course her parents were divorced and she never had enough love from them because they were so busy all the time. Her best friend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steel worker and a housewife) live in a small apartment, poor and happy - and unaware of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The good man (= prince) is a musician (!) Of the French-speaking part of Switzerland who is considered the economically less successful but emotional physical fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain who do not seem to accept his wild life - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so it goes on: Of course, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, though a woman (!), just her career in mind when she uncovered Snow White in pornographic photos on a show. <br /> <br /> This review doesn't need a spoiler to add these pieces to an obvious plot. Like I like other movies from Samir, eg. "Forget Baghdad", I was disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.
