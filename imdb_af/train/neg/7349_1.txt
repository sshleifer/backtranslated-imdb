Polyester was the very first John Water movie I saw, and I have to say that it was also the "worst" movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Water's talent team includes several people I have been working on for food, and was prepared to say what Waters wrote. Every thing of the movie is horrible, acting, camera, editing and the story of a woman played by 300 lb transvestite was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That said, I have to recommend this movie because it's very funny, and you won't believe the shit that happens with poor Francine. Her son beat solvents and bumped unnecessary women's feet at the grocery store. Her daughter is the worst slut in town. Her husband is a cut A-hole from a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress ever. Edith looked and sounded like she was reading the lines of a cue card and had never seen the script before she filmed. <br /> <br /> Despite all of Francine's travails, Waters cooks a fantastic Hollywood end and everyone (who survives) is happy to stay.
