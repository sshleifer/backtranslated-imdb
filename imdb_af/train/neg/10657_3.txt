I had a lot of hope for this movie and watched it with many expectations. basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is a wonderful actor who has marked his footsteps forever in the sand of the time. But this movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching the movie, the cruelty and violence in teen and watch orange look much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring police officer. Who is assigned to an investigation into brutal serial murders. Raghavan finds the jumper effective in this case and is close to the murders and the soul killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, sit behind bars, but escape and re-enter a deadly spree. Eventually, Raghavan both kills them after they have saved many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> Those two murderers are those who will prevent the audience from going to the theaters. The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly, which the film could have survived without. <br /> <br /> Even to suggest that teens and kids watch this movie in the theater and the kind of picture they have to paint in their minds is definitely not pretty. The director, Gautham, must realize that he also has some obligation to the community and to her. Certainly I'm never going to watch the movies like Gautham's name on the production list.
