I want to make a "Holmes with Doors" play, but I can't quite pull it out. Suitable, rugged and overworked WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that Morrison can channel simultaneously .... but how nice this movie is about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films flash it all the time, hitting the graphic violence instead ... as someone once said about American cinema double standards: "kissing a breast and that's an X, hide it and that's an action PG 13 ". . WONDERLAND is also 14 minutes long, and at the end of the tawdry spiral we were all happy to escape the theater. How many films called WONDERLAND will we get? There must be six in the last decade. The clipped violence and muted color set the tough tone, but the wobble cam becomes tiring, as if we were gnawing all the time. To form a few clues, the doors and taxi driver the next day form the next day.
