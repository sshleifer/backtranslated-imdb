I visited an Athenean cinema today with my two children (6 and 8 years old), paying 3 x 12 euros (about 45 US $), not to mention gas, popcorn and soft drinks. the theater and was "forced" to watch what could have been a wonderful 3d movie masterpiece, but just proved it to be a bad "cold war like" propaganda movie, like no one I've seen in the last 20 years . AND THIS IS PROVIDED To be a movie for children ... in heaven's name! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average working Greek doesn't make more than 850 euros a month (about 1050 US $) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My kids love it ... but again they are no more than babies> in Greek: mora, morons> like the one who wrote the script and the other who made this "3d shame". <br /> <br /> PS 3 3D animation is fantastic, but what a ....!
