Danie tries hard and is too bad with all her screams and goes crazy, spills water on herself and rolls on the floor. Too much. Calm, get yourself together and let us laugh. I didn't understand his comparison with comics and rock stars well. Just because both are on stage or something? He said every comedian wanted to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really up to it when he was alive. He had some good jokes like the Burger King joke where people scream at the ride. I also love the Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane did not act so mentally, he might be more beautiful and I could have given it a higher rating, as high as maybe eight.
