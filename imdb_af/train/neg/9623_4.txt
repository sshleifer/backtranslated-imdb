Ben Stiller doesn't work as much as responding. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy that goes around him. In There is something about Maria, the standing hair scene just works because Stiller is trying to keep a straight face. Confronting Maria's other two suitors, he is the most uncomfortable man in the room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Quieter is surrounded by a variety of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. Hoffman said this, a bit too much on physical humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to the jokes to make a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman jumps up is completely overplayed (though it throws one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent who delivers a smile - noticeable by Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Stiller's characters could have played a lot. Aniston repeats her Rachael role again, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more of a "Joey with a loved one in Rachael" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is a by-pass rom-com and it's his failure - it lacks heart. You should not root for the characters. With a little more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the movie's failure comes down to poor writing. It's worth checking out on a slow night on TV, but you'll regret looking out for cash.
