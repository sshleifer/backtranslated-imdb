I saw this movie in 1959. To "Howard the Duck" I saw it as the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie tried to combine all the genera into one; comedy, horror, teenage anxiety and the hot rod that "My Mother, The Car" had to have. Perhaps it deserves a second show to see if it's an accurate reflection of time.
