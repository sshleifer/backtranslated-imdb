A disappointing end to a season that started so well. <br /> <br /> Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were the best seen on television in any series, where it was rather bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was the disappointment that was a disappointment, but the cheesecake that went with it was ridiculous and would have been more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if corporate executives didn't like the low key notes and wanted to jazz it up. They failed and spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> We hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> However, we have seen the return of a certain person, even if it is bizarre and neat.
