Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about this movie. Is it because it is from 1975 and Chamberlain and Curtis have it and therefore sometimes forgive the very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people become sentimental about this movie because they've read the book? (I didn't read the book, but I don't think it's a problem, filmmakers never accept the viewers reading the book). <br /> <br /> Is this because I am unknowingly irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors are trying to act on their French counterparts?
