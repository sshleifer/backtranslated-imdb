A plot that has focussed and irreconcilable differences of opinion was a condemning destruction with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. The horror was omitted and replaced with an overall dull effect, which was probably intended to be horrible, but instead showed a bad dose of beliefs that killed each other, despite the title itself. Being a fan of Masters of Horror from the beginning, this ridiculous plot with his sordid depictions crashed like a brand new rock chair after sitting. I saw this episode as thrown from the beginning, never really other places than seeing it through what it was worth and relieved when it finally came to an end.
