I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is "TRASH". The play was done so badly. I saw high school children doing a better job. The whole favor seems to be just reading their lines, no feeling, no emotion. , and no room to catch the viewer. On another note, the special effects were insane and the whole thing looked like it was shot with a camera. Anyone can buy a radio hut. <br /> <br /> The clown itself doesn't look like the one on the video cover. He doesn't even appear in the movie until the end and all he does is hum songs and go around to stick a few characters. There's no real murder, so it's not a real treasure movie. Since I saw it, I questioned a few things. 1. As a Serial Insane Clown Killer, wouldn't it be a serial killer who didn't kill fools? 2. If your friend is missing, why would you go out in the bush to have sex rather than look for her? Really sorry. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it the only real acting suddenly suddenly ominous? Did the cast definitely decide to show effort in their work? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid it so you don't waste an hour or two of your time more than shouting.
