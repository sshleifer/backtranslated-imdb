Generally, I don't do minus and if this site I can give this movie -3 out of 10. I hated this movie very much. I thought your Boll's alone in the dark was the worst I have ever seen, but I gave it at least one in 10 in my opinion. (Stephen Dorff did not shoot anything, made me laugh so I stepped up the ratings a bit). Hell if it was compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for the best movie if they competed. <br /> <br /> Now after the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer which is good, but they could have done better. The beginning looked, but it was, I had to make the most of it ahead because death is so boring. I like killer movies and even if they suck, they can still get some cool deaths. I'm not a fine movie expert, but believe me he'd shot himself if it saw it. Sorry, but it's nothing good to say about it, as someone seems to have taken a camcorder and film this .. this thing of disaster. Your Boll movies are no longer on my worst movie list. It took the cake. <br /> <br /> Well, sorry, I couldn't explain the plot (if there was one), but it was the best I could do. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to crawl in a corner and move back and forth and remind me how bad this movie made me scare me for life. OK, not for life.
