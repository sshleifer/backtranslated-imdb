The movie is pretty confusing and ridiculous. The plot is terrible ... but on the positive side, the play is pretty good, with a few good screams and laps. Sharon stone is OK this time ... not even as good as the original thoughts. The murders aren't as stingy as the first one, it's a shame. It's not the unpredictable mess that everyone says it is. The sex is sometimes graphic, while others are clear, it is fake (they are fully dressed). The script is mostly poor, but the screens with banter and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot turns a few times, but the end is terrible. The tension is always constant with a big doll of "O my god!". The pursued rows are brilliantly directed, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a little class to another rabbit movie. Sharon stone is also a bit old. The pieces where we see her breasts were in the first one nice. This time, they are too terrible to describe. The movies are self-average, but it's worth it. Mainly because the movie deserves some good buzz ... with the opening sequence highlighted. Not to be critical, but if you like the first one - leave this one. Don't ruin the run. You will be glad you left this stone untouched.
