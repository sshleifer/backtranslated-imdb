We have reached the ceiling of incompatibility with this movie. Basically, Dinosaurs boarded this ship launched by some strange old fart called Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides to give the wish of children that dinosaurs are brought in modern times to be seen by all for shameless exploitation. The dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter. (Bad the authors didn't have it). Incidentally, does it seem strange that Neweyes, from all the wishes of the children in the world, wants to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not allow the wishes of children to stop starvation? Disease? War? I mean, come on! Does Neweyes have nothing better to do with all this power he has? Finally, when the dinosaurs come to modern times, they start singing, dancing and destroying (basically the kind of thing you can see on a bad LSD journey, I mean where else can you see a T-Rex what golf jump and on a balloon jump from spider man?). They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) signed the kids who were the dinosaurs to sign an empty contract. Why? Why would children sign an empty contract? Screweyes say that if the dinosaurs take a little ... "Brain-Drain" that he will let the children go. The dinosaurs instead of secreting the evil Screweyes limb from the limbs give in and agree with his terms. What ?! This is stupid! They could only have threatened him, dropped the contract, ate it and then walked with the children. I think the filmmakers have tried to show that violence is bad, which is a big point when the dinosaurs finally escape and a bunch of crows surround Screweyes and believe him to eat completely. Oh yes, it's not violence at all! We're back, don't make sense, it's not fun, it's goofy, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever dedicated to film. Even for a child's movie ... it's BAD.
