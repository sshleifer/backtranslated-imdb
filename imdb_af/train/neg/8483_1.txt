I normally only write reviews for movies that I really liked or wanted. And, as you probably can tell about the number of stars up there, I didn't like it. By now, I assume you've read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie, so I'll hit the summary. Let's break it down, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The concept: The point of departure is set to be interesting. The use of Chaos theory as a theme was interesting. However, this was not done so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that Chaos theory was kind of wrong. The event that took place in the movie looks more like a confrontation coincidence than anything. I think the Butterfly effect is represented by the whole. "God (s) cause Tsunami to bring the image back." The performance comes off as really messy. Some people call this intelligent, but it seems to be another soup film. <br /> <br /> Storyline: Is it just me, or does it seem like Kamal just throws it together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The plot is extremely confronted; Govind lost the bottle so many times in dark accidents (his friend just happens to mix the jar with a packet he sent to India, a crazy old lady just happens to throw the jar in an idol. Unexpectedly meets in the same hospital, and the case of the idol has just happened to the one who belongs to a famous singer.) CGI: Oh god, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 and sucked it. I can immediately tell which parts are animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like that. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yes, I am now that action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stunts in this one were awful and actually distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Make Up: I have to admit, they have a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido man set me up. However, it was pretty bad, I could easily tell who wearing masks. <br /> <br /> The songs: The music was distracting and out of place. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her character may have been the most annoying one in the movie. She was hard, silly, and obsessed with this idol. I actually found that I wanted her to die. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and fridge logic: Let me get it straight: a lab appliance was smart enough to get past a password lock door, but not smart enough to tell the difference between a chocolate box and a jar with a deadly virus in it. And then, an ex-CIA agent coming out to the bottle, is heading for India. Instead of following it immediately, he first married a pantsdancer. A well-known Pandjabi singer with cancer checks in a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment. In addition, he was shot with a bullet in the throat. You'd think he'd be killed, but instead the magical bullet cleaned his crop. You read it right, a BULLET knocked out the crop. <br /> <br /> Before ... The Naidu Character: Perhaps the only nice part of the movie is his comedy.
