It's a very bad movie. I pulled my brain and I can't make one positive comment. The play is horrible. I saw more credible cable access performances. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president and a shark that attack anything that comes close must have made the worst of fun. Night of the Sharks isn't even that bad, it's good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it was filmed. And to remove it, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding out of the 80's techno-synthesized sounds someone actually bothered to record. <br /> <br /> Of all I read, the Italian film industry was dead by 1987. The Sharks night is like a final nail in the coffin.
