*** SPOILER *** Don't read this if you think about the movie, though it would be a waste of time. (Incidentally: The plot is so predictable that it makes no difference if you read it or not) <br /> <br /> If you are wondering if you want to see 'Coyote Ugly', you shouldn't! It's not the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" can be said. The plot itself is as level as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young pretty girl from a small town is a great success in New York. The few desperate attempts to give the movie any depth, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "problems" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness. There is no chance in this attempt to succeed due to the bad writing and the levels acting. Especially Piper Perabo failed to convince one of Jersey's fears of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and very funny thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer made this movie. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what happened to movies like The Rock and Con Air? That was where Bruckheimer things. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a superficial movie with pretty women just to have a relaxing evening, you should be better off Charlie's Angels (which is much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two inches off (3 out of 10).
