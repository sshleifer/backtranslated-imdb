Yeah, I saw the rough cuts. The unsaved sex scenes. The terrible cuts. Almost on the same scale as the movie 'The Need' for terrible acting. This movie is as bad as bad movies get. The bad writing, bad acting, bad effects, bad places, bad stunts, bad things. The best actors in the film were the shot dancers who hired them for the vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the "quick actor" as someone else put it, makes a match here talented. Its unbelievable ability to drive a car when it is shaken naturally by people on the bonnet (see the reflection in the windshield), its inability to turn left, which is the class. OH and don't forget the sex scene. plus his notable use of a toy gun that even failed to disguise the props as a real gun. The other actors on the screen could hardly deliver their lines. It was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there! <br /> <br /> The 'special effects' were so good to the point that the guys who did this took their real names off the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want a party then rent this movie ... then there are many good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve it.
