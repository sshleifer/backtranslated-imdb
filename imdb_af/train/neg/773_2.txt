No, not the administration of GWB, the Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove." Life must have realized what a dog was like because the series was burned two episodes at a time. Most of them broadcast between 11:00 and 14:00. Friday night and 1 hour Saturday morning. What I looked at the whole thing, I can only plead for weekly sudden attacks of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast is unknown which is likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who only act properly (Jones doesn't make it through the whole series - happy woman). Ward has been obsolete since her "Thorn Birds" days. <br /> <br /> The one masterpiece on the plot - killing the heroine's father who was wrongly convicted of Dad's murder but released after six years in the slam - has been stretched for so long and so hastily that you don't particularly care who makes it thin. There is a great deal of "steaming" sex, multiple murders and all sorts of rude behavior - virtually none of them are interesting or credible. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and certainly not talented. The writing and direction are on par with the shoot. <br /> <br /> If you are stuck in the end, the postcard is a (very small) hoot. <br /> <br /> BEWARE YOU!
