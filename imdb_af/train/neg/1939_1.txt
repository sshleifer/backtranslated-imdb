Come on! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys. Not only can Bollywood make brilliant movies, but can seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I'm a BIG Bollywood fan, but anti-Pakistan movies just make me much to enjoy screens, cinematography, sequence-everything action. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy to see viewers rejecting propaganda on either side of the border and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that did brilliantly, not just because they deserved it. thanks to the quality of the Bollywood Masala but also because it is trying to say: give peace a chance and show that both sides are mad who do not represent the masses.
