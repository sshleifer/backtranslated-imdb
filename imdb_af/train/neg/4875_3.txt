My grandmother found me and my sister to see this movie when it appeared in the theaters in 1998. Luckily we bought the tickets, the popcorn and the cool drink, and went straight to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not welcome much. I remember hearing that some people say they didn't like it at all. I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and not worth it. see. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this, but apart from him the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the parts, and I also remembered that the other people in the theater were barely laughing. And what I really thought was bad talking to the animals, because talking animals are only in cartoons, in live stock movies, they are quite a joke! I said that apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist, he is not worth watching this movie, it's pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I watched Eddie Murphy in various movies and I thought he was funny in those I just said he was the only funny part of the movie, neither did I really have Eddie Murphy "big" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, not seen. This movie is not a movie I would really recommend you to watch, because besides Eddie Murphy, you're probably not going to like that, especially because of the many animals that talk about it! <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a 3 star rating from a possible 10 stars.
