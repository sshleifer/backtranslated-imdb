Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" I bought at Walgreens for a big big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a well-spent dollar, or a dollar is a fool. <br /> <br /> Very wonderful set designs and costumes. Apparently, many thoughts and efforts have kept them busy. The set of designs is very Mexican in styling. I liked them very much. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom. <br /> <br /> I guess the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something exciting and cheerful for a child. But, somehow, it gets totally confused. In fact, I'm amazed at how confused it is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is the English dubbing that looks so sweet and bizarre. One of the reasons I chose to experience movies in the original language was made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintentional strangeness. The children are at least baptized with real children's voices as opposed to women who claim to be children who tend to sound very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that devils in hell spend their free time dancing ballet in their long years? You didn't? Neither did I until I watched this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Now, it's a tossup. I cannot recommend it to anyone in good conscience, as it is quite worrying in its own bizarre way. Yet his unintentional bizarreness makes it worth looking at. You decide what you are going to do. I didn't ... for myself it made me feel uncomfortable, as demons were constantly doing ballet movements. Now it's just wrong ...
