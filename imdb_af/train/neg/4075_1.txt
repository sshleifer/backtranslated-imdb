I'm a horror / gore movie freak and this movie was so bad, I felt ashamed of not only the "actors" but also the director and the poor juice of a producer who actually put his money for this shock. /> <br /> Of the title you expect a great massacre, a bit of a storyline and at least a little direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. Watching this, I switched on another TV and watched Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I watched Stern. <br /> <br /> Watch this "movie" I realize I can produce a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in loose change and a broken computer. This film is my inspiration to come in no-budget movies. Look at this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is nothing in it but much talk and very little action. It makes "KaZaam" like a Meryl Streep film. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany hasn't banned it because of sex or violence. Other countries must take into account.
