As Mr. Cranky rated it, I would be requested to just copy his review and paste it here. But as he didn't, I had to let go of it myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing to give this movie 1, instead of 0, is that Malcolm McDowall's play is excellent. But even he can't save this movie from a disaster. The director really had to be distracted when working on this one, because it is just a combination of scenes that are cast with very little continuity, reminiscent of the bad 70's. Worse still, the actors and directors seem to have put it to the test. They probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth discussing the story, although it is a futuristic corporation called the Proxate Corporation who has put together a crew of unavailable people for a dangerous cargo on a old container / slave ship to Nigeria. This boat's computer is a baby held in a glass bottle and connected to one of the crew members via USB 12 or something. The company had to be called the Prostate Corporation, as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an investigation of the same name. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't find one scene I could say made and made real sense in the context of the movie. I just looked at the end when I had the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people actually worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I will not like it because he is a big actor and every big actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a dozen. <br /> <br /> So, unless it's the only movie your shop is renting or you're male and your doctor doesn't do prostate exams this week and you feel that it's a bad thing, then give this one a very large herd, unless of course if you're really community minded, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink print.
