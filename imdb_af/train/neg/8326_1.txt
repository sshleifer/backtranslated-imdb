It's the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh, .... where to start. <br /> <br /> Plot (there is little): Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart, desperately needs a transplant. Clay is secretly involved with his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. In the night these two are going to marry in secret, a heart donor with the same rare blood types happens. Go and determine the chance of that one! Once on the operating table, Clay finds out that the anesthetic is not working, and he can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay looks like a razor sharp shear cut makes his chest open by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha, which we are told is making an annoying voice never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you haven't burst into laughter yet, you'll surely start watching the surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How can a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon, one nurse, a doctor, and a drunken anesthetist? There were more people in the room when I was drawing wisdom. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too important to be taken seriously. The operating room is not even kept sterile ... people can just walk in and out of the room without first washing up. During the operation, the viewer gets Clay's thoughts, which are not too fascinating. Oh ... but here's what it's about ... the doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. To believe that he is unconscious, the villains speak freely. Wow! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... there is at least no interference from anyone in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has been running four misconduct procedures against him undergoes a major heart surgery. Not even Clay's overprotective mother looks at his status. The only one interested to stay up to date is Samantha ... but oh no ... sweet Sam can be there. You will quickly find out about some Scooby Doo dialogues ... <br /> <br /> In the end it won't even matter if Clay has undergone anesthesia awareness because the end would be in both cases the same way. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of the patients who have become the victim of anesthesia awareness, maybe there are some dumb fun to have ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
