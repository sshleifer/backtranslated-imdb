Does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or does it just make the people who see it angry? when I flip through the channels and come to this show, I'm half to look out of morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. What I don't know is whether his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he should say. Pat Roberson is in bad shape. He is an old man who thinks in an old way. Fear of damnation no longer has the same consequences as it ever did (thank God). Now if somebody will answer my answer, I'll get lightning for the rest of the eternity.
