Don't bother looking at this horrible mini-series. It is a six-hour urge, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It is dry, boring, pulled out and uninspired as they come. And it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical skill. Take those six hours of your life and use it for something more worthwhile.
