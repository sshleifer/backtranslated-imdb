After a series of power failures on a remote island zoo, genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the island's detached inhabitants. Man, the sci-fi channel made some bad "original" movies, but I think it's probably the worst so far! This badly written and directed "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all the usual clich√©s (angry scientists who think that people killed by the monsters are "lost losses", characters who walk long dark corridors alone, brain-like teenage characters just the film is dying of a terrible death, etc., and, no matter what, no tension whatsoever. The special effects are frightening ?? The puppets in the close-ups of the title beesties are bad enough, looks like tight soft puppets, but the CGI ?? what makes the computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" look lifelong By comparison ?? is just horrible. There are a few gores, but most of them look pretty unconvincing. Oh, and the death figure of the scientist at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen for years. I couldn't even laugh, it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, this one is just straight. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting triviaes for you? This movie lends music styles to the 2003 scientific film "Alien Hunter", which was much better than this piece of crap.
