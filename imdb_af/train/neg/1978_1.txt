Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic script, cheezy dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what was the hell with that? The director of this movie is as bad as the movie he made. If someone had made time and effort to process the whole thing, it might have had a chance. Bet, the studios are still trying to figure out how to screw up so badly. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian chick wasn't too bad either. These gals carried the whole movie. If it wasn't for them, I'd have destroyed my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If any of those who haven't seen it and had an idea, don't waste your time ... you'll regret it only later.
