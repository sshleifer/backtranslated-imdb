Robert Armstrong (as "Doc" Rogers) decides to take drastic measures. To preserve the criminal continuity, he recruits the environmental boy, Richard Cromwell, as the Edward "Baby Face" Morgan, to run the family business. The naive Mr. Cromwell is taken to the city and installed as president of his father's "Acme Protection Agency", a front for gang members. While Cromwell sold innocently, he sold an extortion rocket. Cromwell falls for beautiful client Mary Carlisle (like Virginia Clark); And the duo find themselves in great danger? "Baby Face Morgan" catches the star Cromwell and me. Carlisle approaches the end of their once "promising" film career. It's a fast, light and unconvincing little crime drama. <br /> <br /> **** Baby Face Morgan (1942) Arthur Dreifuss ~ Richard Cromwell, Mary Carlisle, Robert Armstrong
