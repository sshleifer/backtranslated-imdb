Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads out with his local Jindabyne, Australia fishing friends for a weekend of rest, relaxation and relaxation. But if Stewart swings a native woman's body into the river, it looks the worst. The biggest accident of the weekend is the men's communities. They do not walk out of the gorge, and instead end their fishing weekend with some big catches. Then they go out and report the body. <br /> <br /> The town and the men's lives are rapidly becoming a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of indigenous prejudices that come from local natives. Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney, EMILY ROSE EXTENSION) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but must fight with her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, the life of this young woman, now a media spectacle, is spread out on a candlestick. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water is symbolic of what lies beneath the village of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and wiped out. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young children: Stewart and Claire's son, who is a half-breed Aussie whose mother is, are also some murdered years ago. The young girl lives with her grandparents and tries to release her mother the best way and look for a new body? funny enough ?? a method to achieve this (again the underlying stream of Jindabyne is suspected). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne village feels like falling below the surface, but no one is willing to dive into the dark waters and look around (the symbolism is seen here when a nearby lake is for relaxation and swimming are used, the old city of Jindabyne under its surface). No, that is, until Claire forces them. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting to confuse a little. There are far too many story lines that need to be explored and this is just not done; too many loose threads. The play was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a general messiness hurt overall production. <br /> <br /> I enjoy symbolic movies, NORTHFORK is one of my all-time favorites in that year. But Jindabyne had to pick up his head above the turbid water so that his own problems could be seen, which simply didn't happen.
