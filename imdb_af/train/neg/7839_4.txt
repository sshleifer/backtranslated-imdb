Serge Farnel has made a lot of accurate critics of this movie in the review "The Rwandan Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> Critics showing how France was behind the situation of the United Nations undergo it in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide. <br /> <br /> The previous day, ten UN soldiers were killed by genocide. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers therefore decided to protect their own lives by driving the French trucks. <br /> <br /> By doing so, they gave up the Tutsi which is unforgivable. Of course. <br /> <br /> But we need to keep in mind that the French soldiers organized this situation.
