Wow. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many good actors playing such an important role. Justin Timberlake may be the only worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the strength and money behind what Edison had. <br /> <br /> His play was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors. Very even LL Cool J was good because he had many small parts to cut his teeth. How the director and film company figured out that Timberlake was ready for this role, there is no way to understand. <br /> <br /> His character ruins the whole experience since every time he is on the screen, you're actually cruel to the corrupt policemen to chop his sorry ass and he must be the hero ... I won't don't waste money on this one at the theater or on video. Maybe if you have HBO and do nothing else at 2:00 on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, it may be. <br /> <br /> Seeing Timberlake in this role was like watching one's Kermit. Frog 'acts in a Hollywood Blockbuster, didn't work at all.
