I can't believe that in the 34 previous remarks nobody mentioned that this movie is a blatant rip-off from Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring a seemingly stupid blonde who meets the requirements of a gunman. Hired rifle and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster has been abandoned. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment, while it's just as much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is regrettable. Natalie Kalmus will roll over in her grave. Check out the paper hunt. Recognize him? But it's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is Ewell's introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
