The social commentary was over and the mystery itself was built and solved by a series of incredible coincidences that were totally incredible. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life over the past decade making it remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had trouble understanding why he complained about his stay in Australia compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries he has in England. Can't he insult him on Australian police? It seems to be a very artificial plot point to get involved in a crime investigation. <br /> <br /> The latter episodes of the original series were fairly melodramatic and unreliable, sometimes of psychology, and this one attracts the mantle. rather than returning to the focus of series one. Heart broken.
