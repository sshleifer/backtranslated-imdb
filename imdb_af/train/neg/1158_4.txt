Tenants Two authors struggle to complete their books in an empty apartment. They help each other first and then the tension between them starts to build. <br /> <br /> It is based on a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone is talking about being in that novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, its purple and full of meaning. It was as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions had written the script. It's terrible and I immediately got myself immune to everything the film had to say, which is a shame because the movie is populated with good performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down is fine form, unfortunately none of them can pass the fake of the words and the assumption. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this movie. While it's not really bad, it's very preachy and pretentious to let you go. I lost interest less than one third of the road and had to struggle to get to the end. If you are interested, I'll try it on cable, but I won't explain good money to see it.
