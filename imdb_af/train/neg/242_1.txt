From a poorly confronted plot line that makes almost no sense for bad dialogue and irreconcilable scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way). Mrs. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion, just like her fellow stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as Noah's love of love. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single-parent Noah, is almost unbearable to watch, let alone sing. But who can blame them with such material. Michael J. Murray's script is at its best youth. <br /> <br /> Every year I search TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday movies to appear on the small screen. Films like Miracle on 34th Street, Ernst Lubitsch's beautiful "The Shop around the corner" and of course the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There is Frank Capra's classic "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget about the classic. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a good performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you is advice. Your time will be better spent searching these movies than finding John Art. Merry Christmas!
