I heard this movie was much more stylish than movie director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had previously directed. The problem is that it may be too stylistic. Actually, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released in the single for seven years, and within two years he plays a lot of his money. He is ready to take revenge against the violent casino owner Jake sent to jail, Dorothy. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors tell Jake that he is three days left to live if he dies of a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha puts men on him. Loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) claim Jake repay their money and do some strange work for them. The film is filled with Jake who tells some of the flashbacks and through his last three days before the great revelation about Zach and Avi and Macha, I assume it is so. Also with Terence Maynard as Frans Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences that involve a bit of animation, lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speed for moments, and annoying to the point of confusion and boredom make it a stupid crime drama. Nice arm!
