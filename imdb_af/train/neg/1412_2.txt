Watching this movie, I got a movie for a movie called "Making 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Author: It's Fantastic! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only afford to rent him for one day. I think we should get someone else. <br /> <br /> Author: So we rent him for one day. A movie is an hour and a half long. A working day is eight hours long. I don't miss a problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... he'll have to spend time in character. <br /> <br /> Author: We therefore have him a character who is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he will still have to understand his motivation and everything. You don't say we have a big name actor doing a low-budget movie, are you? <br /> <br /> Author: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: It's ridiculous! Well, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we should also set up the movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Author: Of course. <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: This font is a load of crap. We can make better money on this. Just in case, Morgan Freeman's character stop is Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Author: Sure thing! <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: Wait a second ... What about a small bodega with a "ten items or less" highway? <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, I think it's pretty strange. But we can't change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt my writing has many similarities to reality, but also "10 Items of Less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see it. Looking at an independent movie, you expect it to convey a kind of message. I think they might have tried to leave the tired guy "nothing to keep you back" message killed in much better movies. Anyway, with '10 Items of Less ', the only message I got was,' Look! Look at Morgan Freeman! '
