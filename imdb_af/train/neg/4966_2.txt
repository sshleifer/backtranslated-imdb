I understand this movie was made on a very low budget, but it is no excuse for the monstrosity that Grendel is. Deathstalker, the throne of fire, barbarous queen, conquest, the incomprehensible barbarian were all done on scant budgets and poor special effects, but they still managed to create cult-class experts by some brave dressed women warriors and a good sense for humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and magic film, but the makers totally ruined this event by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this film with Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi / adventure movie can be made using credible special effects and attractive characters.
