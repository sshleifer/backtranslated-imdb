The movie never becomes unbearable to watch. And to tell it straight, it has nothing to show, except perhaps sexy sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing pretty sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see in some way. There is no tension, little action, unimportant dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same boring places and very mere acting. Kevin Dillon is completely worthless. Silverstone. Well, I didn't focus too much on her acting, I confess. But as I said earlier, if one has nothing to do except watching a movie, it won't look that bad. 10/04
