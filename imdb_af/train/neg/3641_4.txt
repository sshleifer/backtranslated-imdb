Review: According to legend, Valkyrie Brunhilda tested Odin and is chained to a rock surrounded by eternal fire. Only a boyfriend who is pure in heart can go through the flames, free Brunhilda, and release her from Odin's claim and have her for himself. Now the war is breeding in Norwegian countries, and the King needs an alliance with the Berserkers. The Berserkers are warriors who are claimed by Odin's falcons, who are robbed of war, blood and flesh, and therefore outcasts, but better in battle. The leader of the Berserkers is a mocking son of the King, Boer, and his prize for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after the king conquered in battle, he refused to give up his only remaining son, to break his oath to Boar and betray him and kill him. Farmer is only saved by Barek's call on Odin. But this is just the beginning of the fight between the brothers, and their last battle will start now, a millennium later ... <br /> <br /> Comment: I was hoping it would be a movie based is on some Viking land, too much quality film about Viking was done. It also started very well, with detailed longships and armors, beautiful and appropriate sceneries and an OK battle. <br /> <br /> The foundation in the Aesir myths is thin and very corrupt. Odin is much more avenged, excited and absent than I remind him of the school, and the falcons are changing in some vampire demons. I'm not knowledgeable, but it looks completely wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal error made by this movie is shifting the timing from the original time to today. If the two brothers fought it in the right time, with some decent battles, this movie would have been much better. Now the environment has suddenly changed to today's Stockholm. Yet Odin is present and sends Boar and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek, who give dull screens when armor-clad and painted berserkers make sword fights with Barek among the industries. Beautiful mountains and bushes were exchanged for cement. And when I was allowed to focus on one-shot, rather than massive battles like in the beginning, I quickly saw that the actors' fighting and skills were slow and clumsy. <br /> <br /> The end result is thin story, sometimes difficult to follow and other times just stupid, and the only thing that can save it, the action, is drawn from slow, dull and clumsy swordsmen. It draws very little from Aesir myth or Viking tradition. So both story and action fail, and the movie is just bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swedish, this movie is a bit confusing. Supposedly filmed in South Africa, it still contains well-known Swedish signs, records and looks as if it were an authentic police car. However, the effort is poor and goes so far to really put it in Sweden. No names are Swedish (maybe with Anya as the exception), no known scenarios are Swedish, they (believe) speak a little (ancient?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And uniforms, both police and medical, are clearly not Swedish. If they can't do it right - and really give it the illusion that it is in Sweden, why? <br /> <br /> 4/10
