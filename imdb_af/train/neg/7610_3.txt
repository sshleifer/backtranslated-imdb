In general, I don't like films directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is a bit of an exception) and I have never been a Robert Redford fan. Yet I thought "Three Days of the Condor" should be good because of the number of praised comments it received. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow is a great work as the sinister professional killer, I found the whole thing very disappointing. The film unmistakably unleashes the paranoid atmosphere, but everything is destroyed by the hidden plot that doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The movie also features one of the most unsatisfactory ends I've ever seen that really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can one say about the absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I will see any of Hitchcock's movies five times in succession than putting this piece of waste again.
