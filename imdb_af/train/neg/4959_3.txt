Remember the good o 'animated 90's bat show? The one who praised people? The one who can appreciate people of all ages? The one who showed batman as a true detective instead of the Hulk in a bat suit? The one who had your villain, can you relate to? The one who had villains with real motives? <br /> <br /> Clearly, Warner Bros. no. So this drink. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have they even looked at a batman comic? Do they know Batman intended to be a "detective"? Gathering two clues doesn't make you a detective! It makes you a slightly intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic explanation for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Credit opens'. Batman finds dead giving away from where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds clear / stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes. Penguin is doing something again. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and I mean everyone knows kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch's penguin. he gets knocked out. go to arkham. (Note: this is usually another rogue every episode) <br /> <br /> Well, as you may have noticed, Batman is not a big detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's at the old amusement park"! Yes, maybe, he was the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I already mentioned it, but everyone knows KUNG-FU! Even MONEY! what they think? (probably because it's the people who made that Jackie Chan animated series). <br /> <br /> What is really upsetting is that the show is just action. No smarts. None. If batman has to think, he will use technology, and then do kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, let's not forget the villains. Afterall, what would batman be without his rogues gallery? <br /> <br /> First, I must say, kudos for originality. I don't think other batman media would joker and a terrified monkey, riddle like an emo and poison ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing if you think, isn't her sexuality meant to be her greatest strength? ) <br /> <br /> However, even more crap is that each character is now a 2-dimensional, stereotypical crook. <br /> <br /> EC <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham without any reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a powerful, mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for unexplained reasons. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> Notice the pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting thing is Mr. Be Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy award winning 'Heart of Ice' episode from Batman: The Animated Series? The one that Mr. Freeze motives for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in comics about its original back (crazy scientific)? The one who made him a victim with a purpose? Hell, even Batman and Robin admitted that, by using it as Mr. Freezes' origin in that P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr. Freeze a jeweler robber before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold. He then goes on to steal jewels for no reason, while he says songs like an ice day. <br /> <br /> Maybe they were watching Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> But Hey, look at the shiny side. This series makes you feel nothing for the villains, which means you are a good person. Good for you.
