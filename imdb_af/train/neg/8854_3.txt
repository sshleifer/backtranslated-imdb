We had STARZ free weekend and I switched on the station to see what was going on. It was this movie Howling II: The acting was terrible, but the eyeball was wonderful. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eyeball. I laughed a lot at the few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never want to go to Horror movies. If they see this movie, they will know why. <br /> <br /> Just a few trivia notes: Reb Brown playing Ben White played Captain American in a TV movie. Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers' inspiration for the song. "Brown Sugar" Mick has a good taste for women.
