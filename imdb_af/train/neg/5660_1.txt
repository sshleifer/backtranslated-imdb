I'm happy to read so many negative comments about the Tritter plot. Everyone I speak says the same thing. They love the abomination of the house and its intelligence, but really like the revenge of this ongoing plot. It cuts into the true nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry with the police. It needs a more caring nature instead of the revenge of everyone in the hospital. There are also many questionable legal issues Tritter actually does. He alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to prevent doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. Much of the vengeance he shows also hurts the very sick patients in the hospital and it is not a good story to portray. I didn't vote the episode terribly because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor piece, it turns me off and the rest of the plot hurts through it. People say they hate to see the story lines. Please change it. Get out of Tritter.
