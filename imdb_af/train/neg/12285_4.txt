The storyline is absurd and crippled, also sucking is action and the dialogue is hard to keep your eyes open. I encourage you to have a caffeine-powered friend to wake you up in time for some Gore effects. Why bring them Alcatraz? In this case it becomes more difficult to swallow. All the time I wondered who the movie was about. Chock full of lame subplots (like the Cannibalism US Army captain). This is low grade in every aspect. This movie was banned in Germany !!
