The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricature rather than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo since the series in 1969. I didn't think much of the Scooby Doo animated movies (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full-length movies.) But some of them were pretty cool, and I like most people who found Scrappy Doo has to be an irritant, but this series is pure refuse. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters (and I used the term loosely), I spoke. Also, Mystery Inc. was a team, and without the whole crew complimenting one another, it just looks like a box of chocolates opens up to find someone has eaten the best, and the only thing left is the one one that no one wants. . What's New Scooby Doo was better than that. If you are going to have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that have endured the series for so long. The whole cast of characters, and quality animation. They need this one back under the rock from where it comes.
