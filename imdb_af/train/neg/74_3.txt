They built this one as a kind of fantasy. Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance child and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe can play with high-class talent, the bored young women of wealthy older men. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts, which still provide space for artistic creativity to deliver a good historical dramatization. I mean, it's not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life has been shrouded in the ditches so long ago, that the rest of their lives and times are 99%. guesswork is. It's just a few years ago. My own grandparents were already at school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So it's stupid for me to think this movie was imaginative, a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel "The True History of the Kelly Gang", I eagerly expected it to be on a similar level. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger walked about 70 years ago. Kelly was probably much closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which doesn't say much about it. <br /> <br /> It just costs me two dollars to rent the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's just because some of the beautiful shots of the Australian forest make me feel merciless.
