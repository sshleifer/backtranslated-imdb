I think I agree that many of the comments should be fake here. Even if the movie isn't necessarily bad, it's definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost Movie depicting your own ghosts and bad emotions. The movie already starts with two stories that have been detached, which are not even tied together later. A couple lost his child who was found cut in his bed. They move to a country house to flee their past and guess what ... the house is ghostly, kind of. From here, Dark Remains starts very slowly with a few scary moments. (The first ghost actions are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very well). OK, then ... Woman sees the spirit of the daughter, other ghosts of people have died in accidents or suicides, man tries to solve the secret of homes, the woman becomes depressed, strange neighbors appear. It's pretty much all there, but the assumption that it's their own emotions is nice, so you're waiting for the turn. There is no quarrel, you are just confused by a haunted story, the strange neighbor, a completely useless, shameful prison, and the dead girl thrown with a photo idea reminds me of the shutter. The end is ridiculous, because when you start a movie and end it is slow and with keyboard music, it is a beautiful lame to immediately include a few spirits of ghosts that look like a zombie girl, of course just to go back to slow pacing and keyboard music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... Dark Remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script doesn't try to get anywhere and get anywhere. Many stories have merged which just doesn't feel and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie. And next ... please never use abandoned prisons again. It is so worn and in this case it makes no sense at all. "Hey, there's this creepy prison uphill, we can shoot there". I think many ingredients in Dark Remains were thrown into the mix.
