After downloading the overwhelming reviews, this movie came to my country, but I wanted to see it. But - what a disappointment! Seeing a bunch of one-dimensional characters in a plot that doesn't have originality is not the money and time to spend. I sometimes wonder about the film critics in Switzerland.
