A craven, cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows Cahill burglary rich homes, but the male resident apparently is unreliable with the nanny, that's right. The forensic scientist who investigates Cahill has been blown up in his car, but he has a while on the acid pussy, and does not look like a pretty man. It's also right. The Beits, owner of Russborrough House, made their money by digging out darkies diamonds. It is good to rob and hide valuable art from them in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The Garda kills his ferrets and is involved in his murder. The moral equation is sick, Boorman is looking for a hit, but does not have the guts to stand against the delusions of the general gang, who made the neighborhood terror, and unleashed another golf runner on Dublin. He even phoned the generals boy while making it. Disgusting. Sorry for his cowardice.
