I watched this movie for a love project. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it feels like to be his character, and then read the lines he says. My life can't go on ... I accidentally cut off my own hand ... my brother was close. Obviously he is his fault. And since having included happy ends, the good guy who cares for Ma has sad and alone. No closure, bad writing, and not enough extension of underage characters. Save yourself unless you're a good laugh. Costumes were done properly and extras did a wonderful job. I'm sure it would be a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific. I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual movie. It's not a chick spot. It's not a strict romantic. And I can't leave children because of the sex and questions that follow. All in all, just not a good movie.
