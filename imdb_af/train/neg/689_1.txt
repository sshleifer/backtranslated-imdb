What the ........... is that? It must undoubtedly be the biggest waste of film, institutions and camera. I know you can't raise your expectations for an 80-year-old treasure, but it's too stupid to be true. I asked this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel the urge to claim my money back. Can you imagine how difficult it is to STINK? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what is his motivation? Well, actually, you can't care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage certainly didn't mind. They didn't try to create a little bit of tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's much easier to get money with such a name) also made the Kindred (1986) which was quite nice and recently he did Soul Survivors. Also complete crap, but at least one has Eliza Dushku. This litter has Daphne Zuniga's debut !!! (Who?) Yes, that's right, the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. to the opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies right in the first minute, but nobody seems to notice it, so who cares for him? The rest of the actors ... they do not deserve the term actors, is totally uninteresting. You hope they die a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters. <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
