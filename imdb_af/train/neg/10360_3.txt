I was all excited when I saw the ads for this movie, because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. After reading the book, I recently prepared myself for major deviations that often occur when stories are translated into movies. The characters don't look very good with the book. The direction was poor. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not adequately explain what was going on. It just sounded and ran through. All in all, I was very disappointed with the movie. I think if you didn't read the book, it might be good. At least you can read the book, which you will probably enjoy more. <br /> <br />
