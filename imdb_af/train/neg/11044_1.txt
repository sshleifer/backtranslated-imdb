Seen in Australia as 'Hydrosphere', this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you are being hypnotized and must see it to the end, just to see if it can get worse ... and do it! The storyline is so predictable, it seems to be written by a high school drama class, the sets are pathetic, but perhaps better than the miniature, and the acting is wood. <br /> <br /> The baby's muppet looks stolen from the 'Total revocation' prop prop. There wasn't a single original idea in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed most of the way. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame. Of course he needs the money!
