There were a few scary scenes, which I have always kept more than just straight, but otherwise this movie was pretty poor. There were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was rather unclear. After watching this movie, I still got lost in several ways. It reminded me a few years ago of Silent Hill. The movie was also unsatisfactory, but still better than that, because it tried to work and the story made sense. This one, not so much. <br /> <br /> The play for the most part in the Desolate was decent, but the movie dragged on and never really gave any satisfactory conclusion. As I mentioned above, there were some creepy scenes, but otherwise this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can't recommend it.
