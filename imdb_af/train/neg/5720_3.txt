Some Gorehound friends have recommended my 'Live Feed', and I can't really complain because the movie definitely doesn't deliver a huge amount of brutal tracks and buckets, but of course it's not a very good movie. . More than anything else in the latest trend in horror theater, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson, tries to outdo every other movie in this subgenre (and includes the role models "Hostel" and "Saw") with his sick & distorted makeup -up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked fellow eds trying, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no real summary to describe. Five completely mindless twenty-something friends travel to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but otherwise I don't really know why they decided to travel there instead of to Cancun. They are clearly not interested in continental culture and even cause a hectic scene when they see a local slaughterhouse a cute puppy on the market. The quintet then dives into the crooked night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal tribe. Clearly, an apology is not sufficient, as the gangster follows them into an adult theater and is gradually subjecting them to evil torture. One girl chased her chest and another poor tip even cut off a poisonous snake in her throat; Yikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite all the bloodshed and the amateur-like production values ​​are pretty hard to watch, even if you're used to watching independent fan-boy scrap film. The fat block depicted on the cover, an Oriental S&M officer, is quite cool and he is also the most talented of the whole lot, as he has been silent all the time. I will not recommend this pile, but hey, if you like hard and boring metal music, tortured failure and dull losers, go straight and look!
