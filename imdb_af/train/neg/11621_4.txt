I was interested in this movie because I knew it was Christian based. The director had a good idea / intention to make this movie, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still has feelings for whom they believe is the greatest love of their life. However, I didn't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character apologized to his friends when they were the one who meant to him. They understood nothing at all and they used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, or anyone else did not know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, but they were against him who resolved old feelings to be treated. His friends were supposed to be Christians and had to be seen as supportive of whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life where we do not apologize to those who injured us in the past and when he tried to do so, they were all against him. The ironic part was his new female friend who had accused him of having an old friend just looking for an old friend when she did a very strange thing to hold his name, address and phone number. She was the stalker! She didn't look like a friend at all, but was just looking for herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be and I feel the movie has done a terrible injustice by making it seem like God doesn't care about true love . Just that you stay with someone with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps you take to make compensation. As I said the movie has potential, but I was tired of the one-sided standpoint that is constantly being repeated and nailed by so-called ... benevolent friends. This movie did not adhere to the Christian faith of love, but I give it a C for his effort.
