After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the stranger is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is inexpensive), the play is over and the story, oh boy, what story? <br /> <br /> The story doesn't look in a direction, first they stuck to the stranger (after 7 years!), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to to release it (why did they catch it?). Then the girl, whose play is most up and running away from this madness, then suddenly she does not, then she does again and then she does not. Then they come to the conclusion that the death of the alien will kill all humanity (and remember, in all these years no other person has seen these permanent strangers) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a lot of strangers to it. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move isn't worth your time, don't see this movie .
