I didn't see it, and didn't plan to see this movie or anyone else including Lindsay unless up to and including "poor little rich girl" fixes her life for a 2 year period that most recently began with her arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I don't know anyone who saw any of Lindsay's recent movies. Rather, I propose that 2007 will be the high watermark in her film career until she cleans her deed. All of the recent publicity just kept her film career out, if she still has further aspirations to make more movies <br /> <br /> So far, movie producers Lindsay have been actively seeking roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions and actually compete for any role. Her reputation is currently 'poison' and may well have a negative effect on selling a checkout ticket on any movie she is in. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... now Lindsay goes with "<br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno wants Lindsay back on his TV show. <br /> <br /> All the foregoing is merely my ADVICE, I have no inside information.
