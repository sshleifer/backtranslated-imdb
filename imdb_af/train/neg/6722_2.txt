You've ever been through a movie and after it's over, it's like a big "wtf!". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another live video action movie, you can immediately forget that you've watched it or haven't watched it yet. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick's stars are quickly wasted in this process. Now, there are quick mercenaries for rental action where the story is pretty bad and the action sucks and what is the point to watch an action movie when the action blows? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new layer in an action series that shoots him a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus. Co-star surrounding Charlotte Lewis and Canada's own Scott Hylands (from TV's Night Heat fame).
