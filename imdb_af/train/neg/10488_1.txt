Elvis left the building and he is happy because he doesn't have to look at this stinker. Scene after scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an unknown writing, even less amusing. Filled with intact deaths, trite gay characters, and hack jokes, this movie is more desperate than amusing. This is the kind of movie that makes one hope. Kim Basinger follows Doris Day in premature retirement. Let's remember her how she was (talented) and not what she became. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to reduce their talents every turn. The old Elvis plays more like Gomer than the King. The only very good piece is the young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to watch the Tom Hanks cameo. The cameo isn't that funny, but at least it's not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick is incriminating photos of Hanks or something that will make him do this movie.
