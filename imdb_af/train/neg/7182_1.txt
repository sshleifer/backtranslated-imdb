I couldn't recommend a Christmas movie any more than this worthless piece of fun (trust me, here are double negatives needed - it's so bad). This film was in trouble with the opening credits when it was announced that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The music numbers are all too long and none of them are good ('Thank you' has a decent melody, but the lyrics are dumb words). I would like to wear the chains worn by Scrooge in the bizarre hell sequence of the film, than to go through this insult to movies. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining part of this movie (totally unintentional by the way) involves Alec Guinness like Jacob Marley. Dressed in a dull powder white costume, Guinness gazes into his screens briefly, trying to make it look like a ghost, or showing his total contempt for being in this horrible movie. Albert Finney meanwhile mixes the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly horrible character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is so terrible a person, it is impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> Get rid of this horror of movie entertainment at all costs.
