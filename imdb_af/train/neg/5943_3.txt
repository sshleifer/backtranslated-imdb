This film reminded me of the Sopranos, and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's main opera operation ever puts his foot twice wrong, the most irreconcilable and inexplicable event that occurred in his fourth season when Junior Soprano was tested for his life. Rather than following this heavy (and swivel) plot line, the authors preferred to completely ignore it. Instead, they focus on Bobby Baccalieri's constant twist on his recent late wife's frozen pasta dish. <br /> <br /> When something of fair interest in Notorious happens - for example, the first, mysterious murder attempt on Tupac Shakur who lit the entire East Coast / Weskusseer in the first place and eventually led to death. from both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as just a little plot to go through. Why was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out of his own people? Did he just cherish his later affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil 'Kim's transformation of the primary office drunk in sex obsession, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here? <br /> <br /> None of these questions are even briefly addressed by the film's authors, who are far more interested in depicting Wallace's turbulent love life to zero which makes compelling dramatic utility. These sequences (including a brain-frazzlingly clich√©d groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only true comparison is made with a network TV movie. <br /> <br /> The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and thin. But more fundamentally, than a biopsy; as something designed to celebrate his subject and educate the uninitiated about the complexities of their life and work; the movie is almost completely worthless. The confidence in meat-and-potato genre plot, along with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a movie like this should swear) leads to a movie that appears to be designed to satisfy only the desires and demands of those . involved, leaving Wallace's dubious status as a giant in his field as the preservation of the easily persuaded and formerly transformed. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity was broadly painted as that of a latter saint, made me really honest that I came up. <br /> <br /> At that point, much like any other, Notorious is crass, calculated and compromised.
