There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are quite nice. "Criminal Insane 1" was one of those flashes. It is so bad that it was nice and appreciated. "Criminal Insane 2" must be one of the worst movies ever made and come from me, it says a lot because I'm not the kind of person who says the worst is. But trust me, it was just awful and running for only 1 hour is 1 hour too long. <br /> <br /> The movie has a rather incoherent story, but caring for a story when everything you want to see is a big fat woman running to kill people because she's not fed. Well, you don't see it in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences coming from the first one. The new storyline could have been very funny to Ethel who was sent to a halfway house and murdered everyone there, but nothing happened until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that stage you fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this movie is just horrific. It literally reminds me of something I shot with friends from my back when I was 15. The sound quality is something else, because you don't understand most characters. To give an example of how bad it is, go in a New York Subway and try to understand what is being said about the speakers. That's how this movie looks. Not that it matters what they're talking about, because the actors are as dry as a dead piece of wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know it says it's the worst movie out there, is tough, but words can describe it not just how bad this movie is. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself. 10/01
