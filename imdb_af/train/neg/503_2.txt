After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to scratch the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I did NOT find any blood vessels in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious score invites several actresses to his castle for a small holiday. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans, the girls are attacked one by one. Who's the killer? Who knows? There is more red herring in this one than on the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pass is stupid. The story is stupid and the skins are not that great either. <br /> <br /> Give this one a miss.
