Rosario Dawson stars as a girl dating rape and then starts a decent in the dark for a chance to revenge. While it's clear why Dawson played the role, it's a chance to show her plays and make a small, independent, un-Hollywood movie. It is also clear that Dawson, apart from a beautiful look, comes out of the place. Forgive me for not getting her. It's not a mistake, that's how I felt, I didn't know where she was. Yeah, I know she's on the screen, but even though I watched the better part of her two hours, she didn't leave me that far. I blame the writing for this since other than the end, not a whole bunch of screens that happened on the screen was really meaningful. The people look more like real and what does not seem to fit together. Forgive me that it is vague, but nothing in this movie, except the end (which I would like to talk about, but it cannot spoil) and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, remained with me . What can I say, it may click with you, it may not be time for me to return. For only Rosario Dawson fans, though warned, there are several real reasons why it is NC17. (And Rosario-please, you're a better actress, choose better scripts)
