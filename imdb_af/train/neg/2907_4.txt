Often China's biggest film ever voted by Chinese critics as well as outside Chinese film lovers, and honestly I don't understand it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, suddenly directed and acted upon, with a complete protagonist screw. Wei Wei (don't laugh) is the cleft, a young married woman who has been suffering from her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi) for the past few years. It is after World War II, and they live with the husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house with little money (the man was rich when they were married). Along came the man's old best friend (Wei Li), who used to be the woman's boyfriend. She thinks she's running this man away from her husband, while the man is almost unaware and thinks he can involve his little sister to his friend. This is the setup, and it is not everywhere you will not expect it. I actually saw the remake, director of Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It lasts for half an hour, and is actually boring, but at least it was beautiful. These supposed classics are pretty unbearable.
