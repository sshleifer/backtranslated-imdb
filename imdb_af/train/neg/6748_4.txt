Let me say by saying that I watched this video by watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the very best horrorflick ever, even though I thought it was pretty good. Blood is pretty bad. The best part is to see the female throw naked. The gore is very fake and over. It has its funny parts, but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to see the terrible end. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses. The only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) is in more than a hundred other videos and I also saw two other members of the equal or worse movies. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
