Really? Really ???? I know if you make a political war movie, you'll be noticed, but this movie was just rubbish. Terrible in every way. Terribly inaccurate in so many ways. I have an easier time believing that the president of the United States is gathering, flying a jet plane and shooting aliens. It is easier to notice the few things that are right. My khaki dropped when I saw someone say this movie was the best for the past 25 years. It was exaggerated, seemingly senseless plot changes, and at the same time had questionable cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities ?? Did anyone check that these things didn't exist in 2004? It's not as if you had to do extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am an Iraqi war veteran and if you spent ONE day with an infantry platoon or an EOD team, you would realize how B.S. this movie is. Comparing this with Platoon or Private Ryan saves is ridiculous. Why don't you just throw Commando and Red Dawn into it; I think it can be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see the incredible plot, historical and factual differences, then this movie might just be OK. Nothing more. If you continue with "Oscar buzz" and add your own pompous review, go straight. As far as I'm concerned, I write the director to see if I can get 131 minutes back.
