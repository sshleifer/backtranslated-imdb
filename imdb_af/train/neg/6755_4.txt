Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with an upset past who gets more than what she had negotiated if she went to a pool party with an attractive colleague. When her date and friends say they belong to a 'murder club', Maddy takes it seriously and moves straight to 'Level 3' by tapping into the brain of a woman in a parking garage (to get her car drunk!). But is Maddy also the one who donates a plastic mask and kills other members of the group or has lost someone else? <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly designed, full of holes and spirals completely out of control for a ridiculous, left-handed, field-turning end. Some of the dialogue is straightforwardly ridiculous. I didn't have a problem with Rochon's performance, but the supporting role was frightening. However, I managed to thoroughly entertain this Full Moon release. There is lots of skin and blood and this is the perfect type of movie to sit down with a group of friends and fall apart. Horror fans can also enjoy the cameos of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
