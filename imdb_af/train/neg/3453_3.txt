It seems that more consideration has been given in the IMDb reviews of this movie than in the source. <br /> <br /> Here's an overview without pretensions: <br /> <br /> Just when you think nothing is going to happen it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Dress it any way you like, it's a dull movie, full of unrelenting characters that makes very little interest. <br /> <br /> One if you want to convince an impressive emo chick that you are so deep, man. <br /> <br /> Not something to watch for your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless. </ br /> <br /> You're. <br /> <br /> Pretentieus.
