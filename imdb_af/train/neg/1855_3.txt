This is the crappiest movie I have ever seen, but in all fairness it is visible and funny. I don't think the filmmakers meant it to be your typical Hollywood blocker quality. It's just a silly movie about a serial killer that is flowing into a load of toxic waste, causing a reaction with him and the snow (as in mid-winter). He then turns into a killer snowman enough to make you laugh. This movie is really stupid, but it's funny. The murders are hilarious. I wouldn't recommend buying it (as I did). The cover looks good!) But if it's one night on TV, and you're on a laugh, hold it.
