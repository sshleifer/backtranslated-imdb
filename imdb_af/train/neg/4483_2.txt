I will admit that I liked the first one, and was really looking for the successor. <br /> <br /> I was lowered. Certainly the special effects were technically wonderful - but they weren't credible. It looks more like a cartoon. All right, I admit I want 80% of the chase - but the battle with all Mr Smiths? It was too naturally animated. <br /> <br /> I can accept it all. What I can't accept is that the non-action parts were crazy. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in for a speech that went on forever and didn't matter. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the little plot that existed. What this film did was to us that in the first movie there was no truth (except for the existence of the matrix). This movie was a bit like seeing the episode of DALLAS where you realize that the whole previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want $ 7.00 back!
