Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent for your sins. Then things have to turn around the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie only plays a bad reminder of a drunk's crazy life. His mother died. His stepmother is a b_tch. His father died. He drinks. He married. He has children. He drinks even more. His wife gets angry. He defies his children. The woman threatens to leave. He calls for b / c late night he wants to kill himself. Then, after the repetition, it's when we get the "Left Behind" -like subtle message. <br /> <br /> "He needs a salary". This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over once credits started rolling so I would not lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen falls on his knees and begs Christ's forgiveness. As soon as he does, he walks outside and actually says he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he has found God and that is good enough for her. Flip the scene four months and the woman is tired of going to church. Take the film down as Madsen walks at the bar and give a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He gives a little wave of dismissal to the bar (that is, sinhouse) and gives a gay, Miami-Vice, a special school gratifying leap in the air as the room vases. See why I had to repeat the phrase? "He needed a salary." <br /> <br /> Man this movie is bad. The B-grade 80 production values ​​do not help much. The writing could easily have been a "Touched By An Angel" episode. It could have been poured in 30 minutes plus advertisements. The acting is wood and never credible. Even Madsen, of whom I am a big fan and the only reason I sat down, made it clear that this was his first acting job and he didn't know a $$ of his elbow, but of camera. 45 minutes later I began to discourage. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to throw it away and say it well, I saw half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I was sitting by Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit through this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don't give this thing is 1: 2). I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Michael Madsen launch". Summon me. 2) Some of the Dialogue is so bad it is classic. At the end, I'll keep some quotes so you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> It's about it. To raise this, this thing is a piece of shit that has to be flushed with the rest of the villages. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (Also see TILT, EXECUTIVE PURPOSE, MY BOSS DAUGHTER, etc.). Now I have to resurrect Reservoir Dogs and torture Madsen to torture a police to get my respect back to him. See you, children. <br /> <br /> "These things are going to make me blind, but I'm going to drink it anyway." - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I don't understand! Everything looks so beautiful!" - Madsen walks outside to confess to God <br /> <br /> "I'll go later in the center and pick up a bible and I will also get a haircut "- Madsen after the conversion at the table, because Satan lives in your hair
