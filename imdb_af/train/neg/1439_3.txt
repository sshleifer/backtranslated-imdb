I only give 3 stars for the beautiful photos of Africa. The rest was ... boring. For about 50 minutes we have the plot of the plot. In the World War, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10 minutes? Then was true action! It's something like, "Let's walk in the savannah and wave at the beautiful sunsets!" And maybe deliver a message, like "Don't kill elephants!". Very ecological. I would have expected it from a "new" Steven Segal movie, not from this. The leading actress reminds me of artificial tan, colored hair and too much foundation! And I didn't see one scene where her hair was messed up, or her sweat or her clothes were dusty. She just doesn't look like a 19th century woman! And in the bar, where they are looking for our hero, Swayze comments on the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published in 1896. It became known in the next year. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So, unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a good impression. As a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I hug with a nut, but you get the point. He really managed to see the beaten puppy on his face several times. The movie stinks. Way too long and increasingly boring. don't see it! Don't buy it! It's a waste of your money!
