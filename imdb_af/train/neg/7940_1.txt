Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any moral attributes. He just wanted success in a society where all the people, the politicians, the businessmen, the journalists, the women were corrupt. The only king is MONEY. The Maupassant hero, Charles Forestier, goes higher and higher in the social scale thanks to his temptation post. He is in love with all the women who can help him in his step-by-step society. At the end of the novel, he married himself to the largest daily paper owner's daughter, in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a member of Parliament and later a minister. The "useless" women are out of sight, but he always keeps in touch with the beautiful and useful women. The picture "THE PRIVATE BUSINESS OF BEL AMI" is a story of MORALITY. It's all but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why did they put "BEL AMI" in his title?
