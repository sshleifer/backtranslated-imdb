In 1988 Paperhouse was considered a "think man's horror movie." Wow, you can say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It contains a once-off young actress who has a range of 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (dented) accent, and a story with no chills, excitement or spills. <br /> <br /> It's not This is not an interesting psycho bubble. One will just laugh at his cheap effects and long for a show of Leprechaun 5. <br /> <br /> The story involves a girl with glandular fever escaping in her dreams. What you get is not good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after the two hour point said. Where did I go two hours. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired and I wish it could even be pretentious ... something interesting. It looks like the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the dream world, things are boring. <br /> <br /> A short no on this one.
