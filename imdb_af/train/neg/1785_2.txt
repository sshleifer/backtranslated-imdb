.... And after you see this stack, you won't be surprised it's not published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie by any standards, but if I point out that it is one of the worst movies titled Stephen King in the credits, you can start thinking how bad it is is is. The movie starts with two characters opened on a horror scene: <br /> <br /> "My God. What happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I don't know, but they are certainly hate cats" * <br /> <br /> The camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are killed and mutilated. Boy this guy is right, someone hates cats and with such a deduction he must be a policeman. Oh, wait a minute, he's a policeman and when a movie starts with a policeman who makes an oh so obvious observation, you just know you're going to watch a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it is very illogical and confused. We finally find the samples of the title must survive the blood of virgins. Wouldn't they be better off looking for a virgin in the mid-western bible rather than a US coastal town? In addition, we at least knew about the monsters' motives - that's the only thing we learn. We never learn how their shape can change or cars can become invisible and these pots with the end apparently stolen from the TERMINATOR. Monster mom walks around and watches several police with her bare hands or blows it up with a police handgun (!), But if her monster race is immune to police fire, why do the creatures have the ability to change shape or invisible to change? The demise of the beings was thought as ill if murdered by a mass attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, why didn't the monsters kill all the cats lying around in the garden? There was a whole horde that could have been set, but the monsters never thought they should kill them. I think it's so that the production team can come to an end. It was that they started the movie. My complaint lies <br /> <br /> We are treated to various scenes where famous horror film directors such as John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make make-up. I think the reason is because when a struggling unknown actor reads the script, they immediately decided it wouldn't matter, they wouldn't appear in a movie, so bad that Stephen King had to pick up his horror friends to fill out the saucepan. This is how badly the TROUBLESHOOTERS are <br /> <br /> * Incredible, as it seems it was not the worst line in the movie. The worst line is - "The cat saved my life"
