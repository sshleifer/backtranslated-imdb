it's probably the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what's with the casting. The front lady in this movie has a kind of nostalgic figuration and is almost impossible to watch for any period without tying her nose. You can go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and can easily find more than 50 qualified, better-looking front ladies. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This movie looks like it's just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I'd rather have been the hour or so that this movie was accessible to television on television. At least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this movie.
