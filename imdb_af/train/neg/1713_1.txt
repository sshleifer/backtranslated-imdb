If you didn't see ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you didn't. A match like 'make your own horror movie one day' may not result in an entry as this outrage of an insult to any viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets have forgotten a story, a plot, proper dialogue, the fact that people need BASIC acting talents and have of course forgotten the credited lighting designer to show up. It appears to be recorded on the crumb of handycams, and copied on even worse equipment. Makeup effect consists of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt thrown over people's heads to simulate their skin melting. It's nothing more than a home movie, and also a very bad one. Just fun to watch for the friends, relatives and neighbors who were ready to show up for the filming. I can't understand for my life why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious movie magazine or website. I have home movies from wedding parties that are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The successor ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just about the same rubbish.
