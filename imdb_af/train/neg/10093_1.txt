I can't believe blockbuster carries this movie. It was so bad. I was totally deceived by the goat art. DO NOT BE COMPLETED !! It's not worth your time, I promise you. I don't know if the positive reviews for this movie were joke or what. I'm so disappointed. : <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box doesn't even fit! The girl who did the voodoo on her is a stripper. The summary on the back says she's just 17. Has the people who write the movie description even make it hard to see! Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be. If someone really likes this movie, I have lost all faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> Not even did I start the story compared to the title. Or the fact that the whole movie was done in 2 places. Or that the police didn't even have close to real uniforms. Why would I even say this? Who cares about police uniforms! Compared to the rest of the movie, the uniforms were on the point. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans.
