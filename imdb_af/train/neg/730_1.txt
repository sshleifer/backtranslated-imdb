I didn't see the first movie and if it didn't have such a great desire. <br /> <br /> After watching it just a few hours ago, I struggled to remember something about it. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, it's mostly a group of very annoying people, staying at a home with a dodgy old woman from Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I start a law suit against the person who sold me this movie, because I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this movie out of my hands ...... oh wait, I've already given it to a "friend."
