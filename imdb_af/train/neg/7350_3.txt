Despite nice bad reviews, did I just have to give this movie? it does star HK superbabe Shu Qi plus 6 other Oriental loves as a team of all-action cat burglars. It's probably worth checking out? Well, like going to babe festivals, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye cake is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang have caught my eye. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if someone judges this movie with any other merit, it's an absolute stinker! The story is poor, the action is slim and the special effects are straightforward. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing gave us a photo shot and a little different. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you're considering seeing this one, you'll be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again!
