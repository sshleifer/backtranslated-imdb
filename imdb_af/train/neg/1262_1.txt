This film has a poor plot, poor characterization and very poor special effects that I question why I lost valuable life by looking at it. It has random characters that add nothing to the story and looks like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the movie. The robots are sad and the main "hero" boat is switched on by a large knife switch. If this movie wasn't that bad, it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. It is sad when you are rooting for the bad man, because he is the best to brave. When all was said and done, this movie was better on the cutter floor, or never funded.
