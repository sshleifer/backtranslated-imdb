Everyone just looks noisy about the subject, and doesn't really notice how the film was made. The deaf, dumb guy is good, the suspect wins - it's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is average overall. I think it can be made much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a movie not based on an actual event. I'm sure the movie can be made more interesting. The songs were just filled in there, and I had to literally present the screens where the same thing would be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good, but good. Watch Portable.
