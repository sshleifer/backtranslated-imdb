What a Leftist Hollywood load is. This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble as it is for pacifist principles. The fairy tale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, who is actually promoted for his betrayal. What about these Hollywood tools? Is it still a refund for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I sound cynical, it's because I'm full of movies that have a political agenda. The military buyer in this movie is portrayed as, what else? Gung-ho war mongers. Sounds familiar? Do you ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not angry? Think about it. Again, Crimson Tide emphasizes that point. The Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, comes across as a rogue, to the end, of course, he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his bloodlust, advocates the treacherous Ron Hunter, and repent by retiring from the service. A man abuse, take command of your boat, put the UK in serious danger of receiving a nuclear first strike, and you promote him ???? What is swinging!
