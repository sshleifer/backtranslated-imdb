The championship game is just a few days away, but things in New Orleans aren't as they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdosage to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life gets in the way of what an unforgettable, wonderful time should be. Can things be put right again and a killer stopped before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think about reading Superdome, it's not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a plot device and an afterthought. Instead, Superdome is another of those mean soap opera-ish 70's made-to-TV movies populated with Hollywood's legs and those who will never be. The towed sleepwalkers go through the thing, with no one really looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role and usually looks at why he is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills as a hit man? Yes, right! It's about as credible as the case she has with the liquor, David Jansen. The movie also has no speed. Try to get all four or five story lines in the movie, regardless of the flow that Superdome might have had. With no drama or tension in sight, Superdome is ultimately a very poor example of a 70-year-old TV movie. The only outlook for me was the voice of late Charlie Jones - a sports opportunity I didn't listen to. The eloquent way in which he overestimates the plot and overheats, the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its best. <br /> <br /> Like most others who saw Superdome, I also did so much at Mystery Science Theater 3000. This could be one of the KTMA access departments, but this is one of the best examples of the early start. Although I only classified Superdome 2/10, I will give this episode a good 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
