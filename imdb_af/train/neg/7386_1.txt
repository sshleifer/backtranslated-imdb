I tried to start the movie twice again. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Did Steven Seagal's vote change? Did he die during the filming and the studio had to express the sound with someone who didn't even look like him? Or was the sound destroyed on the DVD? After about 10 minutes you finally hear the actor's real voice. Although it looks in most of the movies, it sounds like the sound is recorded in a bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill if I own a copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will check this database before renting more of his movies, which were all (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you got when you watched a Steven Seagal movie. I think it's no longer.
