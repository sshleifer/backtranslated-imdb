I didn't expect much from a movie directed by Sidney J. Furie and played Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected more than one. A one-liner user comment - 2nd action action movie - doesn't seem to depreciate me for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, if the score was below 5.0, I would not have hurt this movie, but hey, the movie scored 5.9 out of 10, which was pretty acceptable to me for this type of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that the 37.5% of people who judged this film were 10 (excellent), clearly a publicity stunt, because DETENTION is the regular Nu Image garbage that you have seen before. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince as a former military who assigned a history teacher to a rough school. His acting is just terrible, emotional and confronted. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent children. Whether they are good actors or, compared to Lundgren, they seem to be great actors - just because they look natural and credible. DETENTION has a few elements that may have been possible for this low budget film - a closed for high-school high-security weekend, four teens in custody with a war veteran teacher and a group of relentless criminals trying to come in - but the story (something like the Breakfast Club meets THE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, lots of clicks and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget. Dolph Lundgren is the lead actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play a Bonnie and Clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie, even though he looks like a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and his , a Milla Jovovich wants to be. In a movie where everything fails, their madness and style provided enough fresh air to prevent my interest from falling.
