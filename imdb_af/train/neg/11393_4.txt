Wow, I can't believe people consider it a "good" movie. Now I have seen much worse, but there are many more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> It's a mediocre movie at its best. While the play was not terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose points that did not appear or addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters come out as full cowards. They do not know themselves well enough to realize that they do not love the people they are busy with. How do we know they're not in love? Through the total lack of repentance, both characters left their finances. I can think of some things that are more romantic than the constant escape from devotion that these two show. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, both will get cold feet and drop each one. Others like hot potatoes are once a commitment. This film is really about two people who can't do anything, unlike Cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt they didn't have a highlight in the story, which basically fit the whole movie: boring. No tension about whether the two will end together, no joy when they do, no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are so blind to the hardness of this movie, that they simply rebuke any criticism with "Everyone is too cynical!". Criticism of this movie is not cynicism, merely unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, try these movies, your hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything Grosse Pointe White, High Fidelity, Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North at Northwest, or There is something about Maria (which is a good investigation into idealized romance vs today's society).
