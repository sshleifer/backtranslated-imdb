Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips had to leave alone enough when he made 'Criminally Insane' 10 years before the release of this godly waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" was less than an hour long, had to get him into the fact that he had probably mumbled this story for everything he would get out of it. But he prefers to use TONS. of footage of the original in this one, even to the point of regaining the original opening credit line! Unfortunately, the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden held back. What a bit of original footage was in this movie, it looks like it has been filmed with a rented hand camcorder! If this movie costs more than $ 100, I'll be very surprised and I'll be equally surprised if it made something close to that amount! Avoid this one and look at the original one!
