I watched the original Batman Animated Series, and am an avid Batman graphic novel collector. With a comic book hero as iconic as Batman, there are some features that can't be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when it's completely changed, it's too far away. I bought one of the seasons of The Batman in the hope that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators' reasoning to make this show such an abomination. In an interview about "The Batman", one of the artists or authors (who is uncertain) said: "We felt we shouldn't mess with Batman, but we can mess with the villains." So, they continued to make the Joker into an immature little kid who was asking for attention, the penguin in a few anime knockoffs, Mr. Freeze in a super-powered jewel thief, Poison Ivy in a teenage hippie, and many other shameful acts that make Bob Kane roll into his grave. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up: I wish I had more hands so I could give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. It pushes through my rating of 2 out of 10 just because it uses the Batman name. Warner Bros ... reconsider! Please!
