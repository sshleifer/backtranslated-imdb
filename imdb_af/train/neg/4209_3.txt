"I'm a cartoon!" "You're an illustration!" what does that mean? This plot can't be any worse than a boy who's scared of everything, being very brave at the end of the movie because he went to a library. The only purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper and more efficient way to do so could have been a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (like the child), Christopher Lloyd (like the so predictable "he is a Library of the Page Master), can save this useless movie from the boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or the Hollywood God of Voices, Frank Welker as the cartoon characters never saves it, I can only describe it as a nineties equivalent to the equally terrifying adaptation of the Water Babies in 1978, because the mere animation makes the movie worse and the dull plot does not improve!
