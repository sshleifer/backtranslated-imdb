This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And it says a lot, as I've seen such stinkers as Demon of Paradise, Lovers Lane and Bloody Murder (who are close second). However, I like bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really stands out. Sometimes there is nothing more entertaining than a weak slasher movie. Regarding the film, the openingstone in which a woman is fried in a tanning does not seem to affect the movie, especially since the film does not tell that the event happened 2 years before the rest of the movie. The play is non-existent, and most of the camera shots are from women's spandex-wrapped areas. The policeman was the most stone-faced, monotonous actor I've ever seen. However, the best / worst part of this movie should be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What do they think? Who's the killer? An unhappy "Huggies" employee? I will have to give this movie an overall zero, but at least if I don't have an explosion
