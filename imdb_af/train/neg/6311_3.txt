It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> For people, a realistic movie is a good thing. It's not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, senseless, sometimes. Maybe that's why people say this movie really is. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are doomed and cursed, whatever you do end up shooting or shooting; don't let the kids play with the weapons, it can be dangerous; And then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Previously, I didn't see such a bad movie. This is perhaps the reason why I have never noticed the importance of photography itself in a movie. In this one, every scene that is shot out in the day is clear and annoyingly blue. They didn't even fix the color balance. Oh! I have so far rated more than 300 movies in this database, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
