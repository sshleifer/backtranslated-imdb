It's a movie that lets you say 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than that (acting, writing and directing). 2) It's so bad. I have to leave a review and warn others. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been shot with my flip video. I also believe my friend who told me to see it has a vendetta against me. I noticed that there were some positive posts for this home video; Must have crew or people with something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. Hopefully, the authors and director leave the business. Not even talented enough to do ads !!!!!
