Hmmm, a sports team in a plane crash, is stranded on a snow mountain and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions to survive. Does anyone sound familiar? I am referring to "Alive" from 1993. The only big difference here is, of course, that a large, white, drunk, scary raven of a Yeti appears a few times to pull out the dead. I think people taste better than fox. <br /> <br /> Dumb: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely bogus. It would either explode in the air, explode when it fell to the ground, or be destroyed. The people wouldn't have survived, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Mute: They've survived, and they're cold. It might be a good idea to use the burning debris nearby so it won't freeze to death. Fire gets hot as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot formed frost over his face while he was alive and talking, but strangely enough, no one else did. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts of the plane on the fire around them. <br /> <br /> Dumb: They find coats and hoodies, and yet there In the cold of Himalayas, they don't fail the hoods! <br /> <br /> Dumb: They stare at a stack of sticks when I repeat, there are pieces of the plane IN BUREND. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are notorious for its storms. It will be common sense to collect the debris to strengthen their structure rather than to sit outside. There are many pine trees, the branches of which make excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: Use a dead man's arm as a splint. If in doubt, use WTF: If one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels, trees and leopards in the Himalayas, doesn't he know enough to make shelter and fall from the beginning? <br /> <br /> Stupid: If you want to attack wild animals, the thoughtful conversation around the trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it will be to look frozen with a glass tin? <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and ready to fight the Yeti while the other two were defenseless. The Yeti pulled the boy's heart and knocked the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever ... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in more idiotic, but most action takes place in the last 15 minutes. Think of the spear and the chain, although it is a little ingenious (with the magic-appearing chain) that they lacked at the start of the movie when they couldn't even make fire, despite the fact that this is all about they were. br /> <br /> As usual for the Sci-Fi originals, the loving couple at the end kiss like nothing terrible, it just happened to them (not to speak, they ate human flesh and got them not brushed in a few days.). <br /> <br /> At the end, however, are quotes.
