Now I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the physiological meaning of the movie in the movie. WOW some demented Pokémon show up and multiply I can get a seizure from it. Animation is useless the makers of it are pointless. This is a great marketing scheme. Just look at songs and they'll get a good score. I think this movie would have been good if they sent out a message, you should see all the Pokémon episodes. understand what happens and it's not a movie. It's just an animation that should be on video. <br /> <br /> PS: I'll give it a 1 because I only got 5 bucks. I couldn't give it a half, because there are no halves.
