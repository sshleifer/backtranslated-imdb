Yes, there are good performances here. Unfortunately, this happens in the context of a movie that has no idea what it does. During the first 45-60 minutes, all the music takes place as a realistic show. Suddenly, about an hour, the characters who have always talked to each other suddenly started singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further in, from nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of conversation dialogue, it seems to drop the idea and move on to other things, like a number starting in a jazz club with A drummer and two electric guitars are suddenly in a fully orchestrated piece with a massive invisible string section. In addition to all this contradiction in how music is used, the composers' distinct inability to actually write music is in the style that is allegedly portrayed. While the first few pieces of the Motown sound of the 1950s mimic, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there is the pure folly of shreds of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation, and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he began to channel Stevie Wonder, I couldn't help laughing out loud. It was obviously one of those movies that made me appreciate how little time I had on earth and that I had been damaging for two hours to watch this movie.
