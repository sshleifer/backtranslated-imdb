I hired this movie tonight because it looks like a fun movie. I thought you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with superpowers. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was confused and useless ... <br /> <br /> It seemed as if the author had thrown in each turn. The author also threw in. lots of toilet humor and sexual situations that can only love a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> It seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story from Fatal Attraction Super Hero .. but I don't think so. <br /> <br /> It's not a fun romantic comedy that's being advertised. You can't take a child to see it and you'll be ashamed if it's a date. <br /> <br /> If the author did a basic story about the high concept and cleared it, the movie might have a chance. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
