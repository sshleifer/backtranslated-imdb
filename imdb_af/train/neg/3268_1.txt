It is a real challenge to make a movie about a baby that is devoured by wild peas and the mother is wrongly accused of being murdered, but at one point this one succeeds. Meryl Streep overwhelms the show of her life, melodramatically, but with that comic genius that makes you laugh even if a mother struggles with the ultimate horror. <br /> <br /> As comedies about the babies eaten by dogs, it is not your cup of tea that you may notice uncomfortably, and yes, this is a strange choice for the subject for a farce, but Very little of the movie has nothing to do with it, as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accents and facial twists. <br /> <br /> The movie is the chance to make the daring point that such things are bad.
