I gave it more than 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and it caused my wife and I to comment. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I have to admit I came out feeling like I had over the battle with God, God and Christ are our saviors. The movie and the story line didn't need it. If you, like me, are restoring a Catholic or Christian, avoid this one that will make you uncomfortable. The film did a good job of showing the thin line between a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker, focused on what was possible.
