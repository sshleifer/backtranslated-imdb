Nowhere near the original. It's a fairly accurate copy that doesn't bring the story. But the direction is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good direction. Baldwin is simply a second league compared to McQueen. I just watched it out of curiosity, a big fan of Peckinpa's masterpiece, and I have what I thought. Nearly a second-rate, second-rate and acting movie. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they're trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a tribute and it does have a very good actor of his era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photo. <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or look at the original (again :))
