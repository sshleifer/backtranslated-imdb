I couldn't wait to get the DVD after I heard so much about the movie. What a disappointment! It has become one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. There were so many characters introduced, some like others, that it became impossible to follow the story. I couldn't understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the movie, as he was barely involved, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I stopped for about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I might have been quick to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion, it was decided that the chances of improvement were slim. An associate told me that many of the movies were "getting together" in the last minute or less. I was glad I didn't wait and wait another hour. I kept the DVD the next day.
