It's a really horrible B-movie. It is whitish and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic "make in the show business" routine, is almost inconsistent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942, including the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group gets about the standard three minutes, the exception being the Mills Brothers, which for one reason or another justifies two numbers. Ann Miller can't dance to the last few minutes of the movie, and she has little to do, but her good amidst a barrier of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the movie, in my opinion, took place in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to be playing in a train, standing in awkward positions. (In the deep of time, the group is separated in railways during travel.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the film, the trumpet / violinist Ray Nance rushes down the passage to the camera and does an uncle Tom, "sniffing his eyes and wrapping his head like Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is indeed sad. Some movies are best seen unseen.
