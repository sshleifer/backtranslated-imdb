This is the worst show I've seen in years. I believe that from T.V. should be dismissed for his delay. It's so stupid that I can dip when I see it. (although I never see it because it's SOOOOO poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: If Mac says he can; eat sugar, in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it !!! In episode "Eddie Monster", when eddy screams at Terrance, he falls into the crate twice. PLUS the zoned time in which he falls, he does not fall in, he falls to the side. Some stupidity. I can't even say the word Fosters Home. I even made a song with my band on how slow this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
