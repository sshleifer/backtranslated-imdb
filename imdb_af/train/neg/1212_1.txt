Overall, this movie is terrible and never had to be made. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is overwhelmed, you want to feel, "Oh my God, No!", But you don't. Not to mention, because there is no link made to know the character. In the trailer, it looked like the movie would be big, but there was no tension so really. There may have been mystery, but there is. "All she has is a tool." is said on the DVD's back, you would think this film was well planned and clever, but it is not. The end was just terrible, very straight forward and senseless. The acting is average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was a waste of an hour of my life. The "special effects" and sets were also average, nothing special like that ever. There is not much gore or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie is advertised to make it sound great, but really, it's not even worth watching. I do not recommend it to anyone unless they are easily satisfied, through a few battles and a boring story.
