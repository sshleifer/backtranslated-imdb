I'm 47 years old and I've spent so much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi movies. Be quiet, black and white, no budget or big budget, there is very little I can't find to keep something out. That said, I'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects, but that's all. This is a case of story effects. Truth is, we live in a time when there is very little left in a horror movie. Therefore, a good, original story for a movie should be of any kind to really entertain. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn't even have good acting, just good effects. So, unless you can do just that, this one succeeds.
