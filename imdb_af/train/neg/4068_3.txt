With a title like that, it's beyond my understanding how this movie just didn't appeal to me. Admittedly, there are a few decent slim moments and a little gore, but the way the movie was shot and the overall storyline just made me an idiot and lazy effort to make a "shock" tactic. The inconsistent plot begins with a man raped and killed a woman stranded on the side of the road. He and his alleged brother are being held until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend from the bush. He eventually forced her into a house where they screwed and he later showed her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily intoxicated prisoners consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a "grabby" neighbor, and her sexually abusive boss. He explained to her that he was going to kill them all. She dares to kill HIM and then turns her focus on the men (or pigs) who torture and kill her. Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with eating and destroying genitals - which are far from disturbance and essentially soft. The best scene is a graphic bromine handle masturbation, followed by a painful rape. Certainly, "I Spit on Your Corps, IP! Ss on Your Grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "I Spit On Your Grave" based on, mainly the title, and a main character reference - indicating that her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider it a completely blasphemous statement! This movie is a boring, amateur rubble that strives for shocks but fails ...
