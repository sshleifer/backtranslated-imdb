Please, help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the movie is: the first woman killed her husband for cheating on her. That's it. Uncovered by anyone except Cuba and Angie, they design and implement a great assassination conspiracy that no one knows ... and becomes completely free. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are especially hilarious: while standing in front of the president, Cuba, the killer's bullet defects ... which then enters the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch a movie of a news camera and they see ... an idea. They are largely going to protect the film and believe they are the only people who have a copy of this very public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba speaks to a presidential staff member. The PSM says there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims there was more than one person involved. The PSM then denies that the conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. So, I wonder if the PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, the First Lady, is an artist. Cuba can't make a painting, and she says, "You're too close ... stand back ... look from a different perspective, look out of my perspective." Can anyone ignore the idea?
