I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out, as I was a great SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I saw it, the people coming out of the early show shouted, "Don't waste your money!" But of course we had to find ourselves. <br /> <br /> While there were a few funny pieces (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most felt it was serious about an amusing 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer came, many people got up and went out. It made me laugh because I realized that O'Donoghue was just the people's minds for this movie. Or else he was just insane. Whatever - you don't have to waste your time, it's so bad.
