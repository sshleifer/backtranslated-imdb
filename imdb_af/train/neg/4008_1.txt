As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series a totally misrepresentation of them. Vampire Bill is not very pretty and looks much older than described in the book. I have found that they have made wonderfully colorful characters, look very natural and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the crap she's going through Sookie, it's always a lady and in the TV series it doesn't look that way. Not only that, but the prejudices shown in the TV series are not as widely distributed in the books. I didn't expect an exact replica of the books, but at least I expected them to be used for the series.
