Perhaps it contains spoils (Not that anything in this movie is new or it will also pleasantly surprise you) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to regain everything they have ever made in oblivion? Sure, it's cheaper for them, but after a while you won't think there is overall quality and the way people think about them. House of Villains is a contemptuous display of cartoon bags that make absolutely no sense. Some signs of the total disregard of previous films in this one are: The voices don't even come remotely and Iago is angry again (Since?!) I know these movies are directly to children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the movie's music number (which has been Disney's specialty for many years) has hit. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even the very young. All I can do is release more of these same-caliber movies, it is only a matter of time before a small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality.
