I bought it from Blockbuster for 99p. The man behind the counter said the reason was that it was so cheap because the disk was scratched, but did not report that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a poor effort heavier than Paris. Hilton in a hotel room home video. To speak of home videos, since when it has been fair to have them unlocked as movies - I mean to say movies used to employ actors and technicians and screenwriters and so on - no more - just collect your friends and lamb ideas together For the weekend, make the production with a £ 8.00 budget, and get someone with the Casio keyboard (the soundtrack) down the stairs, then slap it on the shelves, for a poor juice, to go alone in the house. desperation. But here's the vowel. I swung it fast and put it on one side, ready for the hammers ... until the next night, while watching a Darren daybreak "Hellbreed" (£ 1.99 to go home and stay from another blockbuster). Now this movie looked like "Grim Weekend" like The Exorcist, so I snapped back Grim Weekend to find some of the moments on the wonderful IMDb board. Sure enough, once I came across the misery, the pain and the horror, to realize Grim's weekend, was a cold on the toast, I could enjoy, enjoy, and come straight to the funny things. And there are many of them. Look at the boards. Then look at the movie. Hell, it can even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
