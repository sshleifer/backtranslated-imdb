Trapped part of GEORGE 2 recently on TV, but couldn't find it to endure it to the end. Not terrible! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There is a lot of agitation, but the direction and editing were so clumsy and messy, it was like looking out or scraping scenes. With the original voice of Monkey, the Monkey was not nearly enough to warm me up here. GEORGE 2 is probably the only worst successor I've ever seen, and it says something. Jeez, because of IMDb's 10 rule, I have to keep typing if I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic-made-for-TV sequel. Disney, shame your head.
