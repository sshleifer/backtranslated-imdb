Ahh this movie had so much potential! A good throw of quality B actors, the thieves of Jessica Simpson and ... it's about it! <br /> <br /> I believe a guy in an unnamed marketing department had an idea. Basically, we can do some kind of Legally Blond movie, but do it in New York. The big bright city of chances, power and money and where everyone is a heartless, power / money-hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, the small town of bimbo, the brother of Owen Wilson and for some clear reason, Andy Dick (just because of him you have to ignore this movie.) <br /> <br /> Basic story line : <br /> <br /> Boy leaves NY girl, follows girl, boy cheats, girl lives in NY with cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, runs by other boy (brother Wilson) and together save the day and kiss. <br /> <br /> A few words come to mind when you reflect on this movie, ie dire, terrible, unbearable, unbearable and xenophobic. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie, but you'll be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This movie causes shock. And I know what you think ... at some point I'll see Simpson naked or close. It won't happen, save yourself the time and YouTube her. You'll have better sexy time! <br /> <br /> The movie editing is faint, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? <br /> <br /> Finally; It is a spectacular betrayal that must be punished to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Another question why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson movie and why are there no black, latin, asian or european people in this movie?
