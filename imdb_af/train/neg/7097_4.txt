This movie has such an unbeatable B class cheapness to all its scenes, effects, etc. To make you think they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like seeing some Wing Commander stuff after Star Wars (completely apart from content). <br /> <br /> Story can be described in one word: FLAT. And oh my God, I can't remember a villain long ago that is so uninteresting. We do not get a reason why he is so ungodly (a congenital deviation, we lead to thinking :) or any true belief or flair to his evil. <br /> <br /> If you go outside Connery, hire `Hunting Forrester 'instead.
