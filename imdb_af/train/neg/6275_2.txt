Very unnecessary movie with characters so acting impractically, that I really don't care who will perform best (or was it the purpose of the movie, to portray a slick talk of cold New York people?) No romance here no, no comedy. Acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. What was most annoying to me was this constant joke with classical movie quotes. Man, can't you see the more you get, the less important is your own movie? Try to be original! A small budget is not an excuse at all, not even a director. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder it only costs me one goat ...
