As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see a lot of movies, and not all very well. Some movies are so bad you won't be surprised to be released straight to video. With taboo, IÃ¡m surprised that it was not released on video at all. It's really a low budget, bad quality, badly written rubbish. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a game of taboo. They write down their worst wish or deed, and later people are killed for their taboos. The question is, if we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The movie has a potentially interesting plot, and I won't give it away. But what has been interesting remains dumb, poorly behaved and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors previously played in bigger titles, so why did they register on earth? If you see it everywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.
