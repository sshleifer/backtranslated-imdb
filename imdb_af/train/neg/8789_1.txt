I checked this one on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile when this terrible movie unfolded. Every time you think it can't get worse, it does inevitably. The acting is absolutely terrible. the plot doesn't make sense at all. The title "cold revenge" in the American DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with writing. The action scenes are taken so clearly in their first tasks. There are many mistakes during dialogs that indicate that there is no plan to do another to at least try to make this movie bearable. I can't remember seeing a worse movie and sometimes I get bad - except for the unstoppable Wesley Snipes. No, who do I estimate, while a bad one, Unstoppable, deserves the Best Picture Awards at the Oscars compared to this piece of crap.
