What this movie does well combines action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that creates more emotion than the audience as a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, this movie has caused my amazing storytelling, frustrating plot holes and conflicting scenes, and I'm hardly "the greatest monster movie ever." <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the beginning, this movie starts faster and shaky. The opening scene - the monster's origins - is champion and fast, with respect for the classic 'environmental' disasters that so many other monsters gave birth to. The pace is fast, which is a welcome break from the long and often senseless dramatic opening scene of other monster flashes and lets the movie jump straight into action. With the 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where' and 'how' of the animal and are ready for action. In this movie, the film delivers. <br /> <br /> After a short and well-shot sequence, the characters are introduced: the lazy boy and his cheerful girl, grandfather and talented sister (aunt) and of course the monster. The characters are introduced into context with each other and their conflicts are immediately apparent so that the audience can feel when the monster is suddenly destroyed in the river area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster it looks looks good: Alien is still known - similar to a dog and fish squashed by squid. The effects of the creature are unmatched and although it seems strange, it is credible and in no way in the movie can you see it. Even the movement of the monster was terribly known, such as a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum, the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in the road. When the monster's path intersects with the family and brings the tragedy, it really is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge, but from there the film's appeal begins to unravel. <br /> <br /> Following the dynamite, the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plotlines are introduced, then leave, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy becomes confused in dramatic scenes, while obstacles occur and randomly disappear. <br /> <br /> As far as comedy is concerned, let me say this: I'm willing to accept that much of the humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so maybe things are lost in translation. But as an Asian college major in college and as someone who has lived in Japan for the past 5 years (still here), I think I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the average white man. It is said that many parts of the movie I understood were supposed to be funny, but for me it was not. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example, after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost, the family is the funeral; All raw. A new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is even higher, as it becomes clear that the two brothers are in conflict. They both start grieving for their loss and are excited to compete with each other over who is more difficult. This competition is funny in its core: two brothers who love each other, even participate in a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of the common love commonly found in Asian comedy. This subtle fold-stick comedy pleasure fun from family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny, but it really looks out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot holes. There are so many points raised in this movie, which are never explained, or worse, explained and hypocrite about the fact that it ultimately turns out to be unrelenting and useless. Finding a barrier is not a stumbling block, it can be a good thing for a character, but you will expect some comment on that. Instead, the audience is obstructed by anti-climax moments when problems are no longer there and no one indicates that it's ever a problem to start. So I ask you: why bring it first in the first place? <br /> <br /> It was common throughout the film, as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie was filled with opposing forces that had never solved each other. Of course, the introduction of new and bigger problems is a married story telling tradition, but if the launch of a new bow leads to the forced shortening of another, you will at least expect the new bow to get full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you were getting several stories, each explaining just 20% of the way and eventually the parts never came together to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Again, I'm prepared to accept a lot of this can be "cultural." Perhaps it is in Korean story-telling tradition to put comedy into a tragedy. Perhaps it's normal for stories to go everywhere like a child clinging to each page out of line, but never ending one. Perhaps it is right to present a problem to develop the plot, but then randomly remove the problem without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe it's all the features of messy work and bad storytelling in a movie that has a much better reputation than it deserves.
