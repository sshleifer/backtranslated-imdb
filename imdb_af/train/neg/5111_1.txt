I was always an avid viewer until I personally spent long hours building a home for the White Family, just to see the house a year later. All the beautiful rocky landscape has been removed, the beautiful stone pavement and the front fountain removed, all the pineapples and pecan nuts in the front are cut off, sprinkler system is torn out. It now looks like a disaster area. They no longer live there ... they live "in town" and just come out for the weekend. It makes me sick to think of all the hours the cute Oklahoma people donated to these people and to see the outcome. The story we all saw on TV was not quite the truth ... don't believe everything you see and hear.
