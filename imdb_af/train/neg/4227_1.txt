I'm amazed that I really saw it. I love independent movies, horror movies, and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add Ninga's, you have crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this movie have had a good time doing so, at least it wasn't a total waste. You will never know by looking at it. Script? You play. Acting? I even think the trees are falling. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a camera there. Period. I don't think there was any real planning involved in making this movie. Such a total waste of time that I will not prolong by commenting further.
