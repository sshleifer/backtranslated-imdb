I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers the only giggle this movie came out of me when I realized I was actually watching it. In a word it is indecent. Unfunny. I totally believe the trivia time about Jack Black, apologizing for making this garbage. I can't believe Barry Levinson didn't just throw this script when he read the first page. I can't believe I watched it for more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 out of 10 * because I love to see Christopher Walken make horrible movies for payroll. Also, the horse, "corky", simply by being a character in this movie, is actually very ridiculous.
