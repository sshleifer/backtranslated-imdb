I personally found this movie to be terrible. First, it was barely objective and presented one side of the debate. The only people offered as the side said he existed are a lot of people coming from a Billy Grahm Revival. Second, it deviated heavily from his supposed subject, Jesus (Yeshua) existed to talk about how violent Christianity is and shows scenes of Mel Gibson's "The Passion". Eventually, it was the director of his former head of a conservative private school to conduct interviews and seek to catch up with the children there. Oh, and also the Techno Music just made the movie look harder.
