Let me confess. I used this video and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Apart from the fact that the movie was basically a parody of the "invisible man" genre special effects (highly visible strings and other such accessories), the writing did not lose a chance - indeed it went out of its way - to all non-WASP racing and real-of-imagined gay. Every insult aimed at a person in writing was either homophobic or racist or both. It begins to stir on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid camera style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is a little surprise. But by the time you get there, you'll hardly care. Bad, it can be a pretty good movie.
