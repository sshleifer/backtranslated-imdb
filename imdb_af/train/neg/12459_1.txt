Considering how much money is budgeted for this movie, you will expect more from the story as a whole. It may well be the most worthless movie I've ever watched. There was no real progress of anything. Character development, minimal. Plot progress, maybe. Enjoy, no. I'm not sure which points are even being tried. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are a little good guys, the American CIA is bombarding everything that doesn't match our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt. And you'd like to see something that looks like a storyboard enhancement accompanied by a death, added. For those of us who realize it doesn't kill a good man to make a point, we will love other movies. In summary, it was a horrible attempt to hide an 'Ocean's 11' style, such a person-to-think movie because you don't just know what's going on, no one who made the movie has done. Home Alone 3 was a better movie.
