As some other comments show, this movie might frighten you if you are a small child. (And that's probably all it's good at.) <br /> <br /> But if you're older, this movie just does one thing: suck mainly - and so I don't mean acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like that. I'm just talking about the "plot" (if you can call it). <br /> <br /> Forward SPOILERS ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I don't want to give anything more to spoilers than what is needed (if you are reading this, you really want to see this movie), but if you graduate from any school, it's just a big insult to your intelligence. When I saw this, I was stunned most of the time because it was just as stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> forming UNITE (an evil UN association) <br /> <br /> -> we are just supposed to believe it is angry. Isn't it evil at all? if so, why is it evil? <br /> <br /> the point of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> it is not necessary to impose it on the people, so why the hell (no pun intended) do they? <br /> <br /> - To serve Christ alone in your heart as lip service. <br /> <br /> -> There is nothing that is considered a true Christian in this movie, says that stupid prayer. so ... just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what? <br /> <br /> So, grading 1/10
