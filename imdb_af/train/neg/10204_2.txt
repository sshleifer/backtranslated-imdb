Initially, the movie looks good, they have determined the character profiles. The plot went in the right direction ... but as the movie progressed, the director seemed to have focused on the wrong kind of stuff. .. or just a large part of the movie was edited. The characters' identities have changed the worst in the movie. There was also very implicit meaning - in other words - they had things in the movie that did not look like the movie itself. AND the title ... no where in the movie fits the title to the movie ... I suppose the title works for the previews .... Actors did well with what they had ..... if they were a had a better director and writer, maybe it would have worked out better. But it didn't. So now there's a new horrible movie coming out this Friday. My opinion! .... don't waste your time or money.
