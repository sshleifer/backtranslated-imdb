Normally I don't like revenge movies .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locations (that is, Hong Kong), awesome gunfights and enough martial arts to satisfy your desires for impressive unarmed battles. Like all vengeance slips, it's a pity you would like to throw a top-floor glass window window into a 40-story building! Double Impact, however, does not choke any of the sensational shit that plots the plot and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes invading "Eye for a Eye" and "Death Eye 2". <br /> <br /> But in the plot section Double Impact is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a boxing group connected to a family friend with money problems or at least what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke in French accents is a common one. It wasn't the watery plot that made this movie bad, but using clich√©d lines and moving from other movies (from deadly weapon to princess bride) really made it worse. Still, Double Impact is still visible. But why are those brilliant movies like these villains (for example, the greedy British man who murdered Chad and Alex's parents and that deadly lesbian red-head boy) that you would hate to hate with your being?
