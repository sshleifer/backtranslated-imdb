Two old friends are sent to Japan to retrieve the results of a genetic research with video tape, stolen by the black suitable ninjas at the beginning of the movie. First, they only need to learn ninja skills, because "only ninja can beat the ninja." Sakura killers are trying hard to be enjoyable ninja movie, but fail it badly. The whole movie is just as hollow and predictable. It's hard to say something good about it: The same plot has been seen in various variations several times before, characters are drawn briefly, direction is boring, and the writing does not offer anything surprising, even in the final stage, which in turn is the movie ( garbage) reduce value. <br /> <br /> Even 80's ninja-flick-fan, who understands the aesthetics of garbage films, is hard to find even this movie hardly enjoyable. . It simply offers nothing new to viewer, not visual or plot. Shurikens are being thrown and catanas floating, but it's not enough to immerse the movie scene intended to be and repeated similar battles, even the most watched viewer for the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to recommend movie to everyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind Sakura's American Ninjas. Even in the visual movie there are no balls and it is time to find any great fighting tones in this movie. There is no. In everything, one of the most useless ninja flicks, I've ever seen. Not even interest in curiosity. Trust me on this one. <br /> <br /> Â½ out of 10.
