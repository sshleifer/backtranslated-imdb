*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do, and he does his best with an incredible role. I can see how it is a movie that may look good like a script, but it is intricate, unlikely and ultimately stupid. I saw the false death coming to a mile. Ren√© Z. tries hard with an underwritten part, and so does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can't remember (the one not Chris Penn) is a great sweat about the actor. See it if you're not smart enough to distinguish between a movie that's so clever, you can't follow it, and you can't understand it so confusingly. See it if you work on stockings camera that makes your seasick. See it if you like to see Tim Roth's work with an unworthy writing. See it when it's free at night. Otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
