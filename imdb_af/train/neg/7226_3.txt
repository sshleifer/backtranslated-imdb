I love the comics. Although I have trouble understanding the stories? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I was up to. Surprisingly, I understand the main plot ?? but some poor decisions made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - very bad look "CG human actors" - in close ups? ?? Why? It didn't work at all !! Horus - and the other Egyptian gods - were successfully made in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors, this movie could have been a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
