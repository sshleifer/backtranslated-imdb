I just sat in the theater bored like hell, I wanted to go halfway through the movie. The plot is simply 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings. So they have to bring a date to enter the wedding. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The thing that most pinched me was the so-called rude jokes. They were highly UNfunny, clicked and thrown in your face to get you into the already dull movie. The acting was below average and I felt that this movie just went over and over, but just a bunch of indecent jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worse movies I've seen in 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Thank you, a friend yelled at me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
