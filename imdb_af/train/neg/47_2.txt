When a man who does not have Alzheimer's cannot remember how many films he has made, he is probably the world's most productive director. The man is Jesus Franco, the king of the so-called 'eurotrash'. His 1980-flight devil hunter is so rushed, impenetrable, stupid, lazy and exploited in the true sense of the word (the title of the movie is misleading, for starters) like any other Franco movie I've seen. It makes it sound really awful, and that is ... Yet Franco has some sort of impeccable sensitivity, a generous way of balding, nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his dumb cheap editing trying to move the extreme haste with which all his films were made. The mix of all these elements causes you to shoot out his films, even if you usually wait for them to end because they are so boring. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is not incomprehensible for the first time. half an hour. The kidnapping by strangers of a white woman apparently being a model or movie star is confused with a lot of indigenous action in South America. There are many nude writhing, dancing, and endless repetitions on an ugly totem pole. You have to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique to cut back on the same shot three times, as Franco's main methods are to extend a movie to the length of the feature. <br /> <br /> The monster that looks like the totem pole is actually scary. He has raw error eyes and his presence is always indicated on the soundtrack by cacophonic groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. Early in the play, he visits a native lady tied to a tree, and it's hard to know what is really happening here, but I think he has her stomach (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the adventure starts properly when a stud bowler and his exquisite Vietnam veterinarian are sent straight to the island to repair the kid's white girl. The flashy man has an accent that is, as mentioned, delayed half of the Brooklyn American, half of English-Liverpudlian and all. All the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughing, which makes for another layer of the film, which can somehow keep your interest. <br /> <br /> Not too much is happening from here, and it happens quite slowly, littered with the strange bit of indignation like a rape. The nebulous action is expressed (haha!) By the acres of 360 degree nudity of the natives and the two female leads, and even of the monster itself. Being exposed to his penis makes him an unattractive prospect for the difficult old age, but it must be done at some point. It is nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera. <br /> <br /> The best feature of Devil Hunter is location filming. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making, but he does not interfere with sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. It's something really cool to experience in these days of crazy CGI sets and ad nauseam backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, there are recommendations of recommendations regarding this film. If you are trying to watch all the videos, you should see it at one time or another and you will be made as uneasy as I was. If you like Franco, you'll see it anyway. If you don't fall into one of the above categories, chances are you'll never touch this movie. Copies of it are not just around, and I couldn't recommend it. It's Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.
