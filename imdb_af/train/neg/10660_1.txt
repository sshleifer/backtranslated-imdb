I'm sorry people who call camal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' may be ulagam to them tollywood! komon guys .. this movie is a thrill without excitement .. <br /> <br /> come from your ulagam and just look at some high-class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> technically good, but style about camal doesn't look like a police officer. There is no excitement you're dragging on and boring to finish, and you can save 3 valuable hours of your life if you left this movie. <br /> <br /> At best, Kamal is the best in tollywood
