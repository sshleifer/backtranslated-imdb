In a word ... abysmal. I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's heaviest effort didn't carry anyone. Ben Vereen had to take his name permanently from the role. I can't believe it is now on DVD (from 2/15/05) with Wild in the streets - another retro stinker. I woke up in bed this morning, decided to watch a movie to encourage me, scan the digital channels. The show looks interesting enough, because I like to watch B-movie fiction, hippie culture and rebellion. Teen flashes. It was somehow known and with Ben Vereen in the throw I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Just after watching it, I now know why the familiarity in the recess of my newly awakened brain crept in. I remembered at the Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists, a 14-year-old (I'm 45), in the early / mid-seventies. The whole theater laughed hysterically and even sighed loudly about how bad this movie was watching. Acting: Terrible, Story: Terrible, Cinematography: Almost Terrible, Music: Terrible, Sound: Terrible, Directed: A Joke. If you choose to look at my warning, remember ... "I told you." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gasses" looking at this turbulent movie - or maybe you should be taken to a "gas" room for you brain to waste. I saw homemade Super 8 movies shy of this movie. Definitely a new addition to my all-time Top Ten WORST movies ... it's there (there, below) with "Tentacles." <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
