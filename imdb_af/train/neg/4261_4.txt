Pathetic. That's what happens when director comes to work just because someone pays him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, good places and settings for a movie of epic relationships. But the show, damn! I swear, in some shots you can see extras in the background staring at the camera or watching the actors, because nobody told them what to do as their "action!" Don't hear. The battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people really? They could have done more damage just by hugging each other. In the slow-mo scenes, you can see people on the field field walking or just standing, blowing their hands. <br /> <br /> Only foreground action is highlighted in some way. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinued. It looks like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even. The dialogues are stupid, the love plot is more embarrassing and ludicrous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen at best, the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk placed the thin cover On the shelf in the video store.
