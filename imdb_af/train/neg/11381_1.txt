Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. But when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I looked at the premiere and was inevitably shocked. The characters are generic and stereotypical. Do they really have to wear an African American man, wearing a Jamacian accent, wearing Tier stripes? WHY are all the Asian characters alive yellow and cut? Should the mother have great thighs? and always choking and complaining?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, rough and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities with, even sting, Astro Boy. Let me explain (dub names for the young): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Short Agreements with My Life As A Teenage Robot, Star Wars, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kamen Riders, Sailor Moon and Co. is going on. Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotyping. Don't start me on the innuendos first. I'll just say they are hidden and very dirty. But seriously. Don't even try to look at it. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
