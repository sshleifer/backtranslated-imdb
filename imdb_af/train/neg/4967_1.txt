SciFi recently had many quality films (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is based on the great epic Beowulf, but it differs so much (and offers so little comparison) that the advertisements on television can name a brilliant Christopher Lambert movie. I didn't expect it to be as accurate as a Hollywood production, but I did expect the "artistic integrity" not to interfere with the real story (even though a little changed at a two-hour time) storyboard flows beautifully in the allotted time slots). <br /> <br /> Did the director and producers have any idea what they did (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one can tell of the massive hearing helmets that Beowulf and his crew (except mullet boy) wear. One big problem I've had with Grendel's look is as if Beowulf should struggle, shouldn't he be sixteen feet long and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment also lacked in all ways ?? in my opinion one in the epic was actually better than the made up mess on the script; For example, bolt is supposed to pull his arm from Beowulf out of the sock? He did not cut off at the forearm after being set on fire by an explosive arrow from a crossbow that looked like it weighs 300kg! And Grendel's mother? They only combined her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually died when he succumbed to his wounds? And honestly, what was hell with that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because it's related to the epic ?. not because there is not one (except character names). The only way I can recommend this movie is if you like the movie Druids (director Jacques Dorfmann)? although I didn't recommend watching.
