I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, that was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart part played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with some subtlety, as in The Big Mes. <br /> <br /> But now I'm wondering why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; Right here, the actors don't mind, the director is lost in his mind, and who knows what the producer thinks. Jack Palance is bored and looks at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters asks herself what she does in this movie. I don't even want to compare her with Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course they had to use the dog story again! They could have come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color is great to see the same place where they shot High Sierra, but it certainly doesn't add any quality to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time when you've seen High Sierra. for. Otherwise, why don't you see a pseudo-film noir. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather die than see it again.
