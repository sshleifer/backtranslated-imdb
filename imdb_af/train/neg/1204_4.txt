I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watch it and laugh the whole day the next day. It's not that bad for a TV horror movie, but it's derivative (mostly from The Exorcist) and business because there's no better word. It won't blow you away with artificial cinematography or big acting, but it's not wasting time either. It's the kind of movie you're watching to kill a few hours when you're not in the mood to think too hard. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for a movie, you're looking for a laugh, don't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute puppy with children of the damned eyes, are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) Are beautiful lace distribution. And keep the clipped Satanist in Maverick shades at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Not a great horror movie by any imagination, but I wish they still made things like this for TV.
