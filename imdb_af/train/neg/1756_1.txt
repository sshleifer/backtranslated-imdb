On the back burner for years (so reported), this television reunion of two of the beloved characters in the sitcom history started badly - and went straight down there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long alienation and get each other's lives. What a new concept! But, sad to tell, nothing worth talking to (let alone making a movie) happens in one of the two years with one of them. So, instead, writing content content itself throws out one loud old plot device after another (most dealing with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the peculiar charm and sophistication that the original show has. winner made. The supportive role is immediately forgotten, the humor is non-existent, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once had is gone. Moore allegedly stopped this project for years and waited for "just the right script" before connecting herself. If it was the one she saw as "right", what was the one she'd turned down on earth? It is not the age of the characters that do it (for the time being, inevitable marches), but the almost complete lack of imagination, along with blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. At one time it was meant to be a pilot, but of course it didn't succeed in generating any interest among potential sponsors. Or for the case, among potential audiences. Quickly and graciously forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic.
