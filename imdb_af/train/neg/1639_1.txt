"Torn" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three unlikely New York Lotharios, ruthless scammers, landed the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This applies to the story and the movie. Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, limp and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends the philosophies of shock jock Tom Lykis with Penthouse letter fantasies. Although technically skilled, it is dated, lattice, poorly written, mean and obvious. People don't act like this. People don't talk like that. Really.
