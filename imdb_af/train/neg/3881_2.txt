A few days ago, I watched a documentary called the fifty most popular films of all time and this is where I first heard of the irreconcilable melting man. As a lover of shocking movies, I make it a point to try to find some of the movies from the documentary - not just the UNKNOWN MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since and I have to say I'm disappointed. Although it's really a bad movie, it doesn't come close enough to make inclusion on this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before I saw the documentary, I've been enjoying bad movies since the book "The Fiftieth Films of All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book has long come out, long before the documentary documentation and the creators of the documentary Medved never credited with the concept. From the Medved book I saw about 35 of the 50 films, but it came to an end. The rest of the movies are not available on VHS or DVD. So, I thought I'd try the same name movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with the UNCERTAIN MELTMAN was that there were some good elements for the movie. First, the melting man's special effects were generally really cool and disgusting. Obviously, a professional (the well-known Rich Baker) was involved in making this look realistic. However, I must also point out that there were more than a few cheap and casey effects - such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after its left arm was cut - you could see it "cleverly hidden" under its clothes! As for the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts penetrate the rings of Saturn without being smashed. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is - as we see it. It's strange because Saturn is so far - it shouldn't look that way - it must be a big speck. Regardless, the scene changes immediately and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, it's someone's guess. Well, shortly after, the survivor survives and engages in a murderous rampage as his whole body melts. <br /> <br /> Now, they are considering having a psycho that looks like a melting popsicle, would you think the government would go all out to find and stop him, right? Wrong. A general engages a lonely doctor to get him !! No army, no police - just a brave doctor. Even after bodies have started stacking, the doctor or general does at no point do anything to find a meaningful search or backup. <br /> <br /> Now, with the stupidity of the movie, you won't be surprised either. to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the chick near the doctor's house runs around, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her in the house. <br /> <br /> When a cute old couple drives late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to pick and kill fruit. <br /> <br /> If a woman sees a foster child, she drops the door to protect herself. It would be smart if she didn't have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving home and escaping, she's just waiting! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and yanks off her top. Why? Well, to give the audience a cheap excitement and make it a valued R-movie. <br /> <br /> When the infant is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him - though now the monster has killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the movie is abundant with silly album elements. It's a very bad movie. But, with the occasional good special effects, it just wasn't a horrible movie I hoped for. Sure, it's good for a laugh, but not where near PLAN 9 OUT OF SPACE in weakness and never had to be included on someone's worst movie list.
