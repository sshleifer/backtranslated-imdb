On Demand generally produces some horrible horror movies, and offers only other horror movies that everyone has already seen, and already has an opinion. It was either Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I have not seen yet, and I actually was in a movie that looked after mood, which didn't happen regularly, because I have all the movies looked. a million times, and it's a lot of movies, and I don't have much interest in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret. I'm not going to spoil, I'm just going to tell you that only a few of the many FEW actors in this movie are halfway through. I think the head girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying, but convincing; I'll take her for anyday psychiatric table, so she fits her role well, even if it's lame. The blood is not that big, just a few of the kills, or may I say "wounds" are good, but you don't see much and there are no body parts in the film to make the injuries look more convincing. By the end of the movie I begged my friend to turn it off, and as a member of the band, the "recording" parts were also not very interesting, although what happened would really happen if it went about recording. I'm done, if you want to see it, adjust yourself.
