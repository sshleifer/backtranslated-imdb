This 1974 Naschy excursion is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and an overview of the publicity photos and packaging can lead you to believe that this medieval skirt is somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> It's a strict PG relationship with easy torture ranges, no nudity and little rand. Naschy (of whom I am a fan) supports her well like Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately, he is more pantomime villain than anything else. One gets the feeling with this movie we've seen him (and that) before. Therefore, strictly only Naschy completest.
