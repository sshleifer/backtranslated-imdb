Like most comments, I saw this movie under the name of The Witching, which is the reissue title. Apparently Necromancy, which is original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most screens of the witches still contain most necromasites and it is still bad. In many ways I think the added nudity of the witch has added at least some entertainment value! But do not be deceived - there are only 3 scenes with nudity and these are the ones around variety. No diabolic body fat pumping involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is so inherently terrible, it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is terrible and straight out of the Troma dressing room. But at least Troma is already in the cheek. It is straightforward boredom personalize. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the injured child in The Innocents, would you believe!) The worst with her high-pitched voice. Welles just seems to be waiting for his salary. The other female head has a creepy face, so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is also bad. He also looks worried like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is inactive filmed with scenes that change for no reason and editing is messy. This is because the witch is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one on that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with the terrible new soundtrack that never gets locked. The 'ghost' mother is also dirty, but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that it gives at least an unintentional laugh. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (the witch at least) is just for the unnecessary. It can't have many healthy fans because it's pretty unstable and I actually found it dull! <br /> <br /> The best part was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply that it was better for this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!
