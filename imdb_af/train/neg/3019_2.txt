how can you take her lively, glamorous bounty hunter story seriously with * that * accent? It's absurd. In addition, the visual style of the director is misleading and clumsy, the plot is a level, boring, confused gangster movie rehash and the play is inconclusive. The film introduces new characters throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashbacks - mostly out of order - apparently just to keep you entertained and confused. The movie ever shows you THINGS that don't really happen and later says that "it didn't really happen, it happened" - see the (deadly) killing of the (foolish) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong sequence of events? <br /> <br /> Terrible choice in casting, a complicated, messy plot and a headache-inducing live style. 05/01.
