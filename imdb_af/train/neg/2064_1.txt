Oh, dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL set new highlights with the sketch display format, it fails at every level. Fortunately, Chevy is scarce and he cannot be convicted of this extreme time. It's very, very bad. While meant to be a political comment on the US at the time of its release (1974), it still does not stay funny or acute. The sketches are far too long and any satirical impact they may have been lost, as they are all postponed to the point of complete boredom. It's credited as Chevy's movie debut and I'm happy to say that everything he did has improved. Avoid, even if curious.
