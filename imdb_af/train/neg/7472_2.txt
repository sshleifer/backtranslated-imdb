This show seemed to be good. Kyra Sedgwick is a good actress and I like the police series, but somewhere in the production this program went very wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the authors should have more suspects than one, you know who did it every time !!!!! It makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and is not credible in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean stupid and bad head. The crimes are uninteresting and slim, and it is just utterly lame. As mentioned above, I hate it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great disappointment and very bad indeed ...
