I do not know what it is about this movie director Sam Mraovich somehow tampered with every little aspect of this movie. I would normally say this is a movie that may not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all time. This movie should be for the sole purpose of being without doubt 'The Worst Movie Ever Ever'. I have seen bad movies in my lifetime, but it somehow breaks down into something that I found bad in something much harder to think. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the only funniest thing is that Mraovich himself sees it as a good movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, wow ...
