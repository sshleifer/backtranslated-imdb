I have to say I really look forward to watching this movie and finding a new life there that will separate it from most dull and over-ridden Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the freshness and confidence in our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I listened to before watching the movie) differs from others, maybe it was because it dared to include new faces (apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of Mexican film directors) and supposedly dealing with it is the writing with modern social behavior, perhaps because it was photography I saw in the trailers bright and realistic instead of theater. The movie seems to be a great crowd, and a great fall. What Serrano is actually dealing with here is the very old-fashioned "battle of the sexes" as in "all men are the same" and "why is it that all women ...;" blah blah blah. Nothing new to it, even so, it uses so much in common and clicks that it is eventually mocked without giving any valuable reflection on the female condition. Full of ordinary tramps on the audience like safe gags about the cliches I've been talking about (always working, always) and screaming gigs (it's a well-active movie in the context). And with scream I mean literally. The initially more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir are, according to Serrano, the more pathetic. I totally disagree with Serrano. They should not have been treated to serve as a puppet for his lesson to come through ... he made sure we received his message and completely destroyed their roles. It was the only solid ground on which it could have stood. Anyway, this is a very entertaining movie at times and you will probably have a good time to see it (if you assume it's being manipulated).
