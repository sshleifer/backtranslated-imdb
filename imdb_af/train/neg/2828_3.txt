There were apparently a number of films such as those released during the 70's. And the fact that I can't remember the title for a single one is a bit of their impact. This is what writers call 'pot-boilers'. They are hardly more than a vehicle to keep movie stars in the public eye. <br /> <br /> We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden. more than enough names to get bombs at theater seats. Every taste in the hero is provided. Although one suspects most of the audience was still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder that stars with so much money and reputation can be so desperate or lacking. . This kind of film almost doesn't add gold plating to a CV. Sometimes actors may choose their director instead of the other way around. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would even be from the beginning. That ridiculous desperate jazz theme music, which also needs some casual noise every time, had all the atmospheric conviction of the elevator Muzak. Who thought he was using a jazz band when a scene portrayed the steamy Central African jungles, or the endless Sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop? Definitely a serious goofball. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and its results would have caused enough atmosphere and tension to increase my score a good two points. This director had taken the trouble to look at 'Lawrence of Arabia' or even Sergio Leone's westerners; He might have learned a few things. But then again, probably, he wouldn't. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played the vanishing women's theme in his film "Frantic". It was later revived with equal panache staring Harrison Ford. In any case, the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible. Here, when Michael Caine would otherwise be obliged to use a little brain and bravado, Rex Harrison was at stake, like some old old genius, to bring him back on track when the story stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least photography was pretty good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then the dumb music has to blow up and the atoms blow the atmosphere it created. <br /> <br /> Action scenes were also confronted and styled, with such indifferent choreographed strife that they could possibly be staged in the first place - year-old drama class. And of course, the players have to fight to a jazz accompaniment - as you do. <br /> <br /> It's about as many comments as this item earns. Except to say that the writing was also rather miserable. <br /> <br /> Stay with your hobby on this one. Even if it contains your favorite movie stars, you're probably disappointed.
