The DVD was a joke, the sound for the first few minutes was awful with sound from sync and Segals didn't even agree its !!!! Pathetic! When the audio synchronization was better in about 5 minutes, the poor plot, lines and actors needed another job, because the movie business was not where any of them should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal's good movies in the early days are the youngest one a joke and it should be an embarrassment to him and the company that made it. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the one who handled it, he'd better return to another party running the show because he has no talent so ever in this. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment to anyone involved in its production and a disgrace to all who saw it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll ask for money back at Block Buster! Check out Ontario, Canada
