With its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of compound workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes is trying to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. The dragon story assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. The fact that there may be a connection between today's Asian drive for industrialization and wealth and past experiences of famine and terror is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an attempt to "nicely" Edward Burtynsky's photos of industrial waste. Many of the movies are a slideshow of these images. They are well-crafted, of museum size, and apparently appeared in various exhibitions. For me, however, it has just been proven that almost any photo can be made to look good when presented well. Operating waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photos and the spoken message of the film remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to imply that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries are in a hurry to industrialize. However, manufactured landscapes offer only strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the American (and Canadian) Links.
