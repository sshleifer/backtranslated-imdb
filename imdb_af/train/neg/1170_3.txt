As a fan of Eric Rohmer's study of the contemporary war between the sexes, I was very eager to see "The Woman and the Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" for how he was men and women during a real war , the French revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie looks beautiful, with every scene designed as a period painting, like a tableaux vivant. And I talked a lot because it's Rohmer's style. But maybe Rohmer was determined by basing the script on a real woman's writings. Why did it usually feel like a docudrama version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel". <br /> <br /> So much like Robespierre et al's remains, how about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled? I humbled myself: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor remain poor." You can also choose a song from Les Miz. <br /> <br /> I wasn't so sympathetic, because the central figure has to go back and forth between her townhouse and country house to stay ahead of the Revolution. At one point her maid is demanding the pantry, but succeeds in laying out a fine repast. I simply didn't understand her, an English sympathizer who rejected and defended her former lover and patron alternately because he and the Revolution shifted the political focus. I think I had to sympathize more with her consistency than their political operations, such as a character from the Scarlet Pimpernel. Hey, the only reason she didn't go home was her disgrace to a relationship and child with the Prince of Wales or someone. <br /> <br /> Usually in a revolutionary period there is some change in the relationship between men and women, but I haven't seen anyone here. I once went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture that ended with a long Q&A; The last question, of an audience member who was much older than the rest of us, had gray hair, and was: "Why is revolutionary so fierce?" She was helped and Marcuse did not judge to respond seriously - but that's the only thing I remember tonight. Rohmer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also grim and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written 8/11/2002)
