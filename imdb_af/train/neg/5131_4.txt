I like it, but I think I could iron at the same time. This reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a completely relentless, formal romcom saved from straight-to-video denial about the release by Janeane Garofalo's sharp turn. When she plays the Frasier of Pets, she finds herself trapped in a love fall when insecurity leads her to succeed her best friend (Uma Thurman) than herself when a caller comes to a court. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie in Ben Chaplin's fascinating career. An average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this movie. He is unbeatable and his anonymity in studio productions is unbeatable on the basis of it, although he appeared in both later Terence Malick films. Uma Thurman does a ditzy driving of autopilot and Michael Lehmann packs it all together skillfully. Icky phone sex already. 10/04
