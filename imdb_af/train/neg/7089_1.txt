A sexually obsessed chef leads a double life: one as a "happy" married man with a ten-year-old child, the other as a sex fight. Most of the documentary film follows him five consecutive days and is told in Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist. He listens to his story and investigates him intelligently. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only main character who does not take out her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie, a big fat "F." As it is, it is an F +, which means it's still a failure unless one likes to be bored. It is probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning the garage. "Diary of a sex addict" falls into the category of movies once seen, one does not want.
