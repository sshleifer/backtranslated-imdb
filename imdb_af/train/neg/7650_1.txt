I know I'm in the minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Your Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not even a road; just a frog. He reminds about one hundred other talented hacks that eliminate an endless Christmas party to another. <br /> <br /> This movie? Is a crap attachment. Slater's talent is only used to a minimum if one believes that he has other things (such as his failed relationship) on his head. Reid plays as if she had forgotten her acting lessons, was seriously hit and forgot her acting lessons, or one of the worst directors in the history of the film. I agree on the third choice, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Your Boll has never done a single thing from which I even got the slightest pleasure. Honestly, I'm happy that he made this stinker. I was worried about Bloodrayne competing with Underworld: Evolution for ticket sales. Now, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> These rates are a 1.0 / 10 rating for this messy, winding crap fastener, from ... <br /> <br /> the enemy.
