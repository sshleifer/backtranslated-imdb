It took 9 years to complete this movie. I would think that within that 9 years someone would have said, hey, this movie is terrible. I saw better in porn movies. The story is tired and played. Abused child becomes serial killer. What about something new for a change. How about abusing child to become a florist? At least it would have been a new twist. Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially unoriginal movie ideas) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that they have been sitting at this film for 9 years to complete it. It shows determination and spirit. With this kind of drive hopefully next time, they can focus on better writing. If you want to see a failed experiment in indie movie showing a writer / director of Michigan, see Hatred or A Minute. If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / director, be Evil Dead.
