It was one of the worst Wrestlemania's I saw. It didn't show up at all. Show map, I thought it would be pretty good, but every game looks just short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the better games. Never did it. I just didn't think MVP was so good, but Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs Khali Wow, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe it mixes Khali and any other person who lives. Terrible match. <br /> <br /> Melina vs Ashley I'm not a fan of female wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was excited about this game until I saw it. . Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs CM Punk vs King Booker vs Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy vs Kennedy vs. Finlay vs Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB game so far. Just a big deviation, for many in the ring at the same time. It just didn't fix it. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs Umaga O.K. not very impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker It may have been the best game of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs Shawn Michaels I really feel this game is deserving to be the last. People make a case for Batista vs Undertaker, but this game was just as good. I'm starting to get sick to see how Cena wins every game. It's getting a little old. Now I have to say, I feel this game is the best of the night, but I'm a big Shawn Michaels fan, so I'm a little biased. Batista vs. Taker could have been better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the night and most other things came really short.
