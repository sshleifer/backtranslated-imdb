Just because an event really happened, doesn't mean it will make a good script / movie. The Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich, claims he is based on real events that happened on a cruise offered by William Randolph Hurst. The author paid more attention to creating a bizarre role characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to live in. The most important moments of the story seem unreasonable; For example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, he believes he's Chaplin. Basing an important element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is thin and confronted. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important part of this comedy, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. No matter who was shot, who is dead, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong character to encourage. As a result, the conflicts are difficult to surrender and the eventual outcome is coincidental.
