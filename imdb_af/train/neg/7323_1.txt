Well ........ Unlike other comments previously written, I must say that the only good thing about this movie is the fact that one guy looks like Jason Donavon who reminds me of my youth has. I have no idea how it won awards and although I am sure there was a lot of effort, it was all fruitless, as the final result is one of the early 90's foreign soap operas. The plot didn't exist, cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with a level performance. It was unfortunately long and the subplots were incredibly unrealistic ....... If your best friend has turned 6 after only 2 weeks of breaking, you wouldn't be best off friends. It was all fantasy. That's all! Oh, and the strange 90's home / soft core indie was stupid!
