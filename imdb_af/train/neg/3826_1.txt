I thought I saw some bad westerns. However, this one cannot be left. Hell I think I'd rather open my eyes to a Trinity Triple function for cryin aloud. I don't think I can see Ben Hur again without laughing my ass. Just really bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like dumb westerns with recognized stars in the thing, look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but very funny. 10/01
