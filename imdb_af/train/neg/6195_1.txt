Poorly made. Terrible action and an end that the director came from nowhere, as the film was honestly nothing. Shock that this movie is being considered for an award at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater was of the same opinion as me - what was the point of even making the movie? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not well thought out. I'm surprised this movie was released - very, very disappointing and wasting my time. Sorry, terribly negative review, but hopefully some people will refrain from making the same mistake. What a pity we didn't have a Q and A at the end of the movie - now it might have been interesting.
