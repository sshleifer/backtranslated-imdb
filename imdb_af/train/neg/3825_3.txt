I watched this movie this weekend, and I was always impressed by the beauty and polish of the film produced by the church. I was disappointed that this one was so brief that members were not informed and left investigators with many unanswered questions. <Br /> <br /> The movie is 70 minutes vignette from Joseph Smith's life. This is not a true biopsy because there is no real coherent narrative. Most of the episodes include Joseph doing good works, playing baseball, running races and laughing with children, often in sloooow movement. What a wonderful kind of people Joseph was, or how? Look at him and beat carpets for his wife Emma. Well, how about the mats of his 33 multiple women? No mention was made of polygamy. A sharp omission. <br /> <br /> It is in such omissions that the film falls. It gives too little information and lets critical thinking hear members wonder WHY is Joseph tarred and feathered, WHY is he thrown in jail and WHY does the gang want to kill him? The film's climax is of course Joseph and Hyrum's trek to the Carthage jail. He drives a real United Nations face that looks out of Nauvoo's doors. But there was never any mention of WHY. Nothing about Smith's suppression of the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and the destruction of his press order for revealing the secret teaching of polygamy. The audience is left to wonder if it is just more baseless persecution of the Church. No mention of Joseph being charged with treason to declare the war law and call the Nauvoo militia. Of course, I certainly did not expect this church production film to present Joseph Bush's recent Rough Stone biography. Rolling, but I was surprised and surprised at how little of the substance was actually offered. <br /> <br /> And, worse, which substance was offered was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped out at me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows that Joseph read right of the gold plates in their two-ring binder, which plates were actually hidden from the terrain. It is well known that Joseph did his translation work by burying his face in his hat and inserting it at the sea. The second inaccuracy takes place at Carthage Prison where the gang storms the cell. The History of the Church reports that Joseph had a six-shooter and even fired a few rounds before kicking out of the window and reporting the Masonic distress signal (as in Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the display of the reality of the gunfire would have broken the heartbreaking mood created by the filmmakers, but they discovered that they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he did. really was: handy with a gun and able to defend himself. In fact, the impression given by the film is that Joseph was a good guy, but also of a milqueto cheese that everyone sustained, thrown into prison and eventually killed in cold blood. He was far from it; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who had many hardships and struggled to achieve what he believed. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but know it is cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushman's biography of Smith, Rough Stone Rolling. <br /> <br /> PS: Church videos have no credits, but seasoned eyes can pick a few familiar faces. Rick Macy is excellent as Joseph Smith, Sr. and Bruce Newbold, beloved as Thomas in finding faith in Christ, plays the fiery Methodist minister here who did not show the Christian love for a young seeker to the truth.
