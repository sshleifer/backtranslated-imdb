Someone is being cracked. Straight out into the naked face, this other man shoots him. He has a number of bodyguards and they sneak the killer, but a reporter is interested. She went to the hospital where they took the man who had knocked. She walks in and corners one bodyguard, but he doesn't feel like talking. I can't figure out why. It's not like anyone else is interested. She's the only reporter there. Anyway, her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But hey, she does anyway. She is going to see the murderer's sister and mother. A few minutes after she left, they got big time - someone was blowing their trailer - big fireball. Then she looks for the bodyguard out of hospital. She found him hungry on his boat, but a moment later they were both submerged, sucking on a dive floor, because three guys were trying to beat them (and the boat was blown up for a while - big fireball). The reporter and bodyguard hit two of the guys trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> In the course of the next hour another man is hit across the street, there is a shooting with several stiffies in a warehouse, a few cars chasing wreck and death, a fake suicide, etc. Lotsa stiffs, all kindsa carnage. <br /> <br /> Big things, but what the reporter and the guard can't see is: why in hell did the old man break. What is the motivation? Of course, this can help us figure out why the reporter is even interested. By virtually everything she is the only reporter on the story. No one else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and bodies. True, the original man who was kinked was not exactly a celebrity. His work was a little dull. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the guard is a Secret Service Agent. <br /> <br /> Is this the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no TV cameras, no other printers, no bloggers ... just one of those cops exposes crimes ... <br /> <br /> So, what's the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Think Lemme ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yeah ... the first woman. She was p --- ed because the president was driving around. And she gets away with it. She's really sharp, huh? But how can anyone ever find out? Why should anyone bother? In fact, only one reporter is even interested. <br /> <br /> I give this move a "1". It was so stupid I just had to look. And it just got stupid! It's the real spoiler! But even if I told you this, you should see it to believe it!
