... for one of the worst Swedish movies ever ... forgive me for being dull. <br /> <br /> First, I didn't see the first one (I was bored, it's my reason to look the 2nd one before the 1st one), but I hope the first one is better than that, it was full strange cutting scenes and many strange plot changes. For the people who saw it and think 4/10 is high (believe me, so do I), but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and I still laugh at the punk that came up with this idea, which is the next "The Seventh Seal II". Sequences that are not based on a novel or a book are often not good, and this is a perfect example of one. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm going to be honest with you: I have a little laugh a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Just let another idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably already laughing.
