This film is made scary, inextricable rubbish. I sometimes like romantic comedies. To watch a good one is to eat ice cream for dinner. It's not something you're going to do all the time, but the experience is so enjoyable that you can ignore how foolish you are. This movie made me think how stupid I was to continue sitting for his full running time. Everything about it shouted at the cheap. Actually, they seem to have overlaid the movie on some points. It is so washed out. It also features cheesy CGI and lame sets. <br /> <br /> The writing was clunky. I know you can usually expect a plot problem in a screwball comedy, but you don't really care about it because you're laughing. This movie is so unique that you actually sit there wondering about the unlikely series of coincidences and totally incredible behaviors involved. Activities were placed in the movie to just move the characters from one scene to the next or to give an outline. Sure, that's how all movies work, but don't see that happening. Inelegant. This is the term I should use. <br /> <br /> There was hardly anyone in the movie that was really nice. I didn't care who finally was with who, as long as they all kept hell away from me and I didn't have to listen, they talk more about it. Why would the only very cool character in the film, the Paul Rudd character, have something to do with the completely bitchy, condescending, control freak played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all the characters involved, consistently chose the most beautiful solution for any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years, just to hang out (and bathe) with a woman he is attracted to? The best feel-good moment they could come up was to make a happy ending to the same moan where he met with Rudd's equally annoying lie, kleptomaniac sister. Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they will find something better in the road.
