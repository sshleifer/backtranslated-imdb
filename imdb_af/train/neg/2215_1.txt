It's a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who loved her was probably dead, but really his scientific father just put a spell on him to make him in this very cute shark man. Similar in Beauty and the Cattle. It can probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks, but there are some pretty gross plants instead. They really make this one girl gagged, so she lets her eat by the shark man instead of scratching the whole movie. The scientific guy is a good father who is trying to reunite his fish with his wife. He even arranges for their private time for sex, but the woman in this is a very shallow snob and thinks the shark man is an ugly, cute monster and doesn't want to do anything to him. She rose to love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty sad how everything she had to do was kiss him, and he would normally turn back and they would ever be happy, but it's not such a movie.
