I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was good at Top Model and was really happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a good guy. But this show just made me SICK! I'm so angry with both of them for what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. But Adrianne, you were together for just six months. It didn't surprise me at all that he didn't suggest. And I don't see the appeal to force someone to marry you before they're ready. If it is supposed to be, why not just enjoy each other's friends and love one another, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and a chain was completely unnecessary, it is stupidly clear that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you to break down and imagine anyway! You were through two failed marriages, how could you pursue another, just because she had a pace? I hope the relationship is expensive, but I really feel that marriage is rushing and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe they can breathe now and find the right reasons to marry inside.
