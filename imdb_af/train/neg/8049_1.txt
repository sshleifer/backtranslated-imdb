A warning to you not to mislead by the names Bigelow and Red. Below is senseless and unrelenting, and I often thought of a phrase from Twain about the wish that all the characters would be drowned together. When someone comes up with the category of the worst movies ever made, it's not like _Plan 9_ or _Attack of the Killer Shrews_ I think of; it's like this. What a total waste of time - my own and everyone involved in this movie.
