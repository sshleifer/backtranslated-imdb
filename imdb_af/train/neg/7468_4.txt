The only thing the movie received to me four, is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's wonderful portrayals of bumbling incompetence. . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents it from being a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, he offers a respected mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan's manic folly. Respective performances are also presented by Richard Roundtree as the harried boss, Vinessa Shaw, as a talented female FBI agent who shoots her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk's adviser and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> The plot concept actually has wonderful possibilities and could, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, prove a great comic vehicle. Kattan, which looks like Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just gives a tangled debris. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, depicting his misfit brothers, both fall far short of their proven ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too much and are too much separated. boring people. What I really miss here is what has always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies. There is no "second level" of white row over the slapstick. No cultural references that only the adults get. . no double entier. . This is not stupid. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't mean I recommend it to your 9-year-old because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and functions.
