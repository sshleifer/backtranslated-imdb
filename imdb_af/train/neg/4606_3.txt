This movie was an attempt to go to places that didn't and didn't dare. It was a similar trial in the bizarre, predominant perspective we've given in The Cell, although it's not as close and in depth and well portrayed. The plot is simply composed with an initial campus feel. Then, if the movie takes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot falls apart on which pair of legs it should rise first. <br /> <br /> The idea is basically the idea of ​​a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He takes the role of a hit, a city accountant. Then he is not paid for his job, but is tortured for a few days because he dreamed the "brilliant" idea of ​​using a backup file that he used as a lever for payment. This idiot moves to force them to pay him back because he is terribly and endlessly abused. He started to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, he thinks he has paid for his sins and can start, he visits the woman (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and wins her love. Shortly after discovering who he is, tragedy and revenge cease air as the boy goes to his martyrs (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their previous "friendliness". <br /> <br /> I have to ask, what is it about Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore type movies? <br /> <br /> Everything that she's been sitting on in this genre looks like it's been. Granted, I love her in "Eight-Legged Freaks" and she was good at "Anaconda". But despite all her obvious gift and dedication (wow, she's hot!), She can perform much better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just a misconception. For everyone there, you get the "full monty" of her in this movie, although it is rather bizarre and short-lived. I almost felt that she was doing some soft porn after watching this movie (something that wasn't strange to Kari's career). The sex simulation is such that it makes you wonder what things really do during filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will say there are some good plays. Do not think much about Daniel Balwin, whose career is destined to get his brother Alex's second. However, the film took out some old folks, George Wendt (Norm of Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job of playing the main character, Sean Crawley. His little acting experience and yet his credible nature as a naive youth, bring some elements of substance to the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not going out of this way. If you are bored and tired of the same old episodes of "The Hitchhiker" then I can consult it. <br /> <br /> Please start some better movies!
