I just got back from this free show, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I've seen this year, worse than even "Catwoman" - who has had the skill to at least pass himself as a fiction. <br /> <br /> In September Tapes goes to a "film crew" from "documentary journalists" to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yes, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of them filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on September 11 - track Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They made eight tapes on their journey, "documenting their journey now" and of course trying to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, thank you, all end up pointing significantly in the narrative, which is convenient for a "documentary".) <br /> <br /> The psychotic, idiotic main character - given long, important speeches He probably learned to watch MacGyver - nothing cares about his own life or the life of his innocent crew, as he is endangering them further and further through a series of totally dumb accidents. I don't know why he didn't just carry a sign on his back saying "Don't shoot me." <br /> <br /> The crew's translator, presumably their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than just and is astounded as the idiot hero leads them into punishment. <br /> <br /> You wish they'd brought someone on their journey to call them all morons. <br /> <br /> Around "Tape 4" I started roaring for the terrorists to shoot the film staff.
