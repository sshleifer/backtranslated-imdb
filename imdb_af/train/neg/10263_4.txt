Yes, the Southern Star has a pretty forgotten title tune that is sung by the heavy set crooner Matt Monro. It actually sets the tone for this bloated and rather boring feature, surprisingly disappointed with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple looking for a great diamond. Add in Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) an ostrich, tons of wildlife stock, and poorly composed and dull photography by Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a thorough unappealing body through the jungles of Senegal.
