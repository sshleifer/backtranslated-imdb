!!!!! FROM COURSE THERE IS SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started out as a writing workshop about avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Checking bad things happening to drug users - Checking Heorin knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't see villain recovering unconsciousness. order so we see reclaimed villain behind the heroine - Unfortunately, it seems someone sent this cliché to a movie study instead of using it for the class. Dear, sir, if only London transport was as frequent as the clichés come here. In fact, there are so many clichés and all this before the moments that no one actually thought to go into detail about what the eponymous creep is or how long he killed people on the underground. I am led to believe that this is the result of a human experiment and perhaps it is not until that night that he has decided to take revenge on mankind, but it is all vague to be meaningless. Not quite negative. I doubt many producers thought they would make a movie that would relax the Oscars that year and there is always a horror movie market. Similarly, I doubt whether it produced too much and had one eye on the DVD market, rather than the film distribution, and I would say that it is slightly better than the 1972 DOODLINE, which is also a murderous cannibal in London's underground hid display. It's just when you think all the cliches in this movie have been used, another cliché comes together to lift his ugly head
