Really. <br /> <br /> She makes herself the focus of every interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can't resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks. She often interrupts guests before an answer is ready to include her own side or anecdote. Of course, directors are instructed to focus on her after-reaction rather than guest's faces, because that's what counts - what Oprah feels, Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says - Be sorry for me, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my struggle with my weight. Feeling hurt if I've turned away from a fancy store after they've already closed. Feel good to buy my magazines and books. Feel good for my success. Feel good if you give me charity to make me look good. Feel good to make me rich, out of faith. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of her point of view: YOU OBJECTORS ARE ALL PARTICULAR AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers for your life, though I have nothing to do with you. I have never been married or want to be. I've never had a family - but I know everything about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me to others - testify "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we're not gay. <br /> <br /> As of 7/31/2006, the headline on her website reads: "Oprah.com is your leading source of information on love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health." How suspicious and stupid is it? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, her two private wedding reception in Oklahoma crashed to collect footage for her September 2006 performances. She keeps promising to close TV, but her yapfest doesn't end in sight. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is not a queen or a goddess or a personal mission of God. She is just one very happy, overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it her own. She was in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck right demographically. <br /> <br /> Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of this age and it surprised me that people cannot see through her facade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you, too, Oprah if you can fit that inflated ego through the door - this way now to the great outing ...
