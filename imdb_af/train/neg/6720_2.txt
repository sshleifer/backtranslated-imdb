Now here's a movie that would be a comedy if it's made in Australia. Unfortunately and annoyingly, here it is, fleshy and cheesy and overgrown by Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a work so horribly scared that no one in their right mind can take it seriously. Unless of course it was a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute) ... or that cliché was stacked on cliché. No value in the story that almost looks like a prelude to Gus Van Sant's GERRY ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER, how is it such a main weight? Well, this author must be so angry that he didn't even come to Burt and BOOGIE, but that he had to make his own. Consolidated and undeveloped, apart from the 'Unanswered Love's a Drill' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we just have moody beefcake and TV series storyline. The necessary fourth act of this elongated drama is actually awful, as the movie, like the Gerries, comes in the desert and holds it there. In Oz in the late 90's, 20 somethings have a similar but actually hilarious movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTOR, it also suffered from authoring an author as Orson, so they filmed half of it again, choosing a ruthless TV editor to upgrade it to 72 minutes and hey -presto .. comedy tonight! A lesson there when bad movies are well lit by relief. I think the FLUFFER stole on release and after I didn't see it, I can understand why.
