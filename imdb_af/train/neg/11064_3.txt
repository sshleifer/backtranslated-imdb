Well, it's hard to comment after reading it, but I feel I have to say something. I didn't exactly search for a splatter party, as someone puts it or even 'blood and gut'. I have some respect for the victims' family, although I really didn't think of the filmmaker. They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a vessel for Dahmer's sexual fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with the kind of morbid curiosity that reminds me "What makes a man a serial killer?" as well as wondering the details of the Dahmer story, of which I know little. People here seem to think that the film should not cover the events of the Dahmer story. IU his history, what happened when he was caught, the aftermath, etc. but that's important! You see, I assume if you're American, you'll know it all. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a man as he was, requires at least SOME of history and real events to be shown / shown. It doesn't mean blood and intestines, there are ways to show imaginative things in a movie or to cleverly film it without using it. Without even touching what he did (I found out more about reading the user's comments on this site!), The movie felt like a void. A moment in time with very little dust. I would like to know if there is a movie about the REAL Dahmer, because with its lack of direction, VERY slow pace that never changes, Strange portrayal of homosexuality and the VERY unhappy lack of any end to end, this movie rare. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste the time to see it. A Determined 1 out of 10 (for the acting!)
