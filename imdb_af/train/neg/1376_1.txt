Of all movies (and I'm a film student, if it's worth something to you), it's the WORST movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably worse kids out there that I haven't seen yet, but I've seen it, and that's the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about young and slow. She is not accredited! Her role was incredibly small! How did she make it on the cover? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the videoback when we returned it and slipped it in the case. It reads something like "please save your other clients to see this full and completely bad movie!"
