Savage Island (2003) is a lame film. It's more like a home video shot with very little lighting and horror acting. Not only that the storyline and the scriptures were miserable. I don't know why this movie was made. I saw a lot of flashes in my time and the one I really hate is movies that make me angry. This one boiled my blood. The situations were at best at best. If I made such a movie, it would have been short. Actually because the backwood "idjits" would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I'm a keen viewer of a bad theater. But this movie is virtually incompatible. I don't mind movies that are on D.V. shot. but if you do, make the movie enjoyable, not a few tired talk of better horror movies (Sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this waste from the disk. If you overpower this one in the rental shop, go through. <br /> <br /> Movies that make you bad get an automatic 1.
