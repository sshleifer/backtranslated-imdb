The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that will be above the despicable garbage level that this film so perfectly represents. don't rise. It's Bollywood at its best / worst, I honestly can't tell the difference. Incredibly sweet, kitschy clich√©s on every level, story line, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To straighten it out, you should be delayed to enjoy it. I watched it satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to leave, because I couldn't take it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the beautiful beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
