I managed to grab a view of this using MST3K, and oh son, even with the riffing of this movie was ominously bad. Imagine someone whose ability with a camera can be done by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The highlights (which were few) came from the special effects, which were "OK". The acting was usually also "OK"; Although nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other B movies I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is dismally bad. The camera work often looks like they have just placed. the camera man on roller skates and pushes him together. The story (if it can be called) is so full of holes, it's almost funny. It never really explains why hell survived in the first place, or needed human flesh to survive. The writing is poorly written and the dialogue accompanies just plain silly. The climax on film (if there is one) is absolutely laughing. <br /> <br /> If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
