Fragmentary film about a few people in Austria during a heat wave. This kind of film is done more often, and most importantly, better. The stories do not really have anything to do with each other, except the pathetic final: "people are cruel". Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a movie that goes too long, without really making a point. Ultra Realistic? Barely ... Drilling? Indeed. Not even beautiful Franzisca Weiss can save this one! 10/03
