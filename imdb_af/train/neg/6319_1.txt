This film reminds me of how college students protest against the Vietnam War. As if some children were told without cowboys in Cow Dung Collehe, the president would immediately change all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, while it is dangerous, the concept of a policy based on whether the USSR and the US went into war, it can mean the end of the world, WORK. The US and the USSR have never had wars. <br /> <br /> We have only conventional weapons, the idea of ​​another war, a "win-able" war in Europe and Asia, not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a wonderful example of "How not to make a movie." <br /> <br /> It must be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
