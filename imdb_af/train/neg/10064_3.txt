pokemon the movie was a terrible movie. Unlike the first one, it's not a good movie at all. The graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built. In the first one, the interaction between the characters was decent. the subtraction of chunks and the addition of tracey was bad. Tracey doesn't really have much to say or do, and unlike Brock, it doesn't offer any comic relief. The only good thing is that you see misty really getting yourself over, and her early breeding about the fact that his girlfriend is called was entertaining. Overall, this movie is not worth renting and the short film previously did nothing to me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans. Well, maybe the next one would be better. I can be much worse
