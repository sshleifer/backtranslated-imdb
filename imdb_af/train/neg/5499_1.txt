I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because the stupidity of it made me go. I look back and realize there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie. Nothing leads nothing. It's very funny that Lizzie chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a gigantic carnivorous demon ... but her bitter little dress is completely intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times bigger than she was when she was the first time . turn it on. Or the kind of movie in which a man with a defibulator can be shocked and just unaware and return to awareness without any medical attention. And don't let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "villain" they decided to create "conflict". Uh huh. <br /> <br /> For the person complaining about Disney, but little ones. The racial parts of this film seem to reject the statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of kinky video tapes? You do if you are Disney and you are out of ideas to make the movie appeal to the above 8 people without writing a more intelligent writing! I am thoroughly convinced that Disney is paying the rating board so that it can get rid of movies with murder and still get family-friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
