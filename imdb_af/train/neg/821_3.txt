Stanley Kramer leads an action thriller and leaves two important things: action and excitement. The DOMINO PRINCIPLE has Gene Hackman as a convicted person who was jailed for a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his workers --- they probably work for the government, but it is never made clear, as most of the movie's plot line. Hackman asks many questions that are never answered, so the movie doesn't go anywhere. While trying to be like NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, the DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed, but even it works against it. Kramer's direction is without any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> The play is good with Hackman, proving he is almost incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are quite nasty and Albert is well-cast as Widmark's cruel mangle. Even the usually stupid Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. One odd thing, however, is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We were told that his time was in prison and she wanted to try a kind of southern twang. Kramer's idea of ​​making her look like a trailer is to wear her badly colored wig. It's a role that is better suited to those of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
