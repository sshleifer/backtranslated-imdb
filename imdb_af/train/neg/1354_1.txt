I watched his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know a thing or two about film. And Crispin Glover's movie is scandalous. He basically uses the mentally handicapped. Not only is the Shirly temple the anti-Christ (which I admit is a little funny) to tell the spiritually challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors who are spiritually challenged as they are all. PETA and Human Rights must be everywhere about this thing. It's not 'counterculture', as Crispin said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.
