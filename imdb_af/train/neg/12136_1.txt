I have this movie on t.v. This afternoon and I can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of waste. It is not funny at all and it takes your I.Q. a few brackets. I know this movie is for kids, but that doesn't mean that the authors obviously have to accept their intelligence. I bet writers are sitting around a big wooden table and have taken hold that a) the word "poop" is equal to a big laugh. b) A four-foot-long child can immerse in a 10-foot basketball net. c) Children should always be armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to defeat so-called "ninjas". One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the worst suburban "gang" in the world that nobody can scare. Maybe the guys at MST3K can use this movie for a good laugh. Don't bother with this lame-ass excuse for a movie.
