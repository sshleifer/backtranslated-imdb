I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, "Criss Cross." I found the latter to be disappointing, but it was even better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "neo-noir" because it's contemporary and it's in color. Two things purists would make would be disqualified for film noir status. <br /> <br /> However, its biggest negative was not the movies (it was good), but the devastated storyline. Hey, some of the 40-year-old Dashiell Hammett stories were similar, but I don't care about any of them either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks in the story, which looked like every three minutes. No wonder this was the story of this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that with the 45-minute point they are so confused that nobody cares anymore. I know I didn't.
