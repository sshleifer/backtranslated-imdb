I was also intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this movie, and was very disappointed. I only saw some good foreign films and look forward to making it three on a row, but it wasn't. I went with a Spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There isn't much of a plot, if any. I don't necessarily need it in a movie, but it must somehow entertain or bring. The best thing I could say is that it wants to be an Altman movie, even with a very small ensemble. Certainly, there are moments, but a few moments are easily invented by 97 slow minutes of nothing. I don't understand the high rating for this movie. I give it a 3. <br /> <br />
