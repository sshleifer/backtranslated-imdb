You won't expect a movie like this to be good, and it's not. This is a no budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand camera ... and it's hilarious. Of course, the actors have never acted and show it in their terribly hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to have escaped a government experiment and a group of zombies seem to terrorize some families. The gore effects are actually one of the most sickest things I've ever seen. The gore effects seem to have caught a butcher shop for all body parts, and many scenes involve zombies that dissolve people and eat their organs. It's a funny and sickly movie, and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
