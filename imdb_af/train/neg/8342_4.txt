Rescue: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror movie. Well maybe it's not that bad. But it's close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is hit and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is completely threatening and brutal). I say maybe because she wakes up and it was all a dream? Or was it? (Cue Music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the movie is that this fifteen minute plot (done very well the first time) is repeated. And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternative reality, I just ceased to care what happened to Claire and began to wonder what a lame turn to end. <br /> <br /> I was rooted for a seance (which would have more honestly made sense), but instead one of those obviously ended with half of the surprises (think the town or below) Yup the movie cuts faster than Donnie Darko's directors cut. All the major quarrels end in horror movies The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, happy birthday for me has been working because the audience didn't expect a leftfield explanation. (Heck, even the canoe that ends in the 13th on the original Friday was worth it) <br /> <br /> On the other hand, salvation shouts doubts that end with every scene change. Other nighttime errors are the one note piano soundtrack (although the songs were fair) the obvious momentum (Claire did the dishes, Claire's mother's subplots), the way Claire says "hello is someone there" every time she thinks there is a series <br /> <br /> Also, some of the secondary drama roles (especially Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander, resembling a Mary Kay zombie), first show actor low budget roots. <br /> <br /> Both too clever with half and not nearly clever. Salvage is interested to see how they will solve this mess. It's really not a problem.
