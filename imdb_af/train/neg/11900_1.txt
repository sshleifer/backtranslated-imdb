How wonderful. Another movie about America by someone who has probably visited a dozen times here, one day a piece, and believes that he is an "expert" on the land. Wow. I have to travel to Germany a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the "country of Nazis" or something. Wim IL boy, you have to make about the Americans with Lars von Trier and the ULTIMATE film. Of course we all know that it needs a prosperous, leaning "we are the world" in Europe to make a "real" movie about America. <br /> <br /> Right, right. For a continent that is not one but TWO world wars, Europe certainly has many views on America's wrong "foreign policy". <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't worry, Wim IL boy, there are many Americans from UC-Berkeley who will just love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think George W. Bush is the worst as Hitler, and that a painting of a can of taste is "pure genius" !!
