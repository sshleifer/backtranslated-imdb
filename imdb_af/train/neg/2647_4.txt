I'll say one thing to Jeanette and Nelson - even if it's stranded in a joyous, inexorable, painfully obscure musical like this, there's still a flash in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the well-known duo is there even when the material is paper thin. Even when the score is almost a throw away, non-existent one depends on just a few catchy songs. And even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Truth to tell, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real husband, Gene Raymond, in SMILIN 'THROUGH, who was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the following fan, but it's the bottom of the hope. Jeanette is more than embarrassed in her one 'hep' number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what it was like in Broadway in 1938. It must surely have more humor and style than it appears in this poor MGM production. Edward Everett Horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can inhale any void of life in this mess. It's like an amateur weekend in the studio, even though the few professionals are sprinkled under the supporting role. <br /> <br /> Summary: Painfully clumsy version of a Rodgers and Heart music game. Can't recommend it, even for MacDonald and Eddy fans. And even though Jeanette's close-ups still glow with her gossamer beauty, this movie is jaw-drop bad.
