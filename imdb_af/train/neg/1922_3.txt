About the baby: Why isn't big brother assuming he'll be hungry for a bottle or dessert or a diaper change? Suddenly he had to shout without much silence. Definitely stupid to take the baby out of a safe place when he didn't need it. <br /> <br /> And why was the road wonderfully clear when someone wanted to drive somewhere? Didn't fallen trees fall on the roads and hide them? <br /> <br /> I can't suggest the police to the roadblock, not immediately to a young person who would crash it, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> It's been said to have a movie that children could look safe for a change.
