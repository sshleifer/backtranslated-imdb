The fraudulent cover, title and very little hidden print of Power of Prayer got me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and pulled me in. I really enjoyed it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 the movie started to set things that were not set and didn't make sense. My first thought was, "It's not written by anyone who knows how to tell a story." I finally watched parts of the movie and thought I missed something. <br /> <br /> By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the movie, it was all USED, MEETING, RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG that didn't matter, didn't say anything, and was annoying to to listen; I turned off the sound and made a quick forward to the end. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Beware of DVDs called Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> And I'm a Catholic practitioner.
