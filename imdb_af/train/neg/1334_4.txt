So I told the movie "My Left Foot" last year after my mom's great how great it is ... The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and wonderful, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should do nothing less don't expect. <br /> <br /> The fatal judgment in my eyes was that I was proving the normality of this man; The film chose to show him as a complete and complete jerk. On the one hand, I can see that this is a logical correlation; mankind always has the ability to object, and disability should not hide it. I just wish that impartial viewers would not be so forgiving for deviant behavior and assume that circumstances would automatically forgive them. They don't. Executing is normal, and if so, disabled people act - but they do not because they are disabled. they do it because they are unreasonable. A physical impairment does not give you the right to give a physical fitness to the public, just because someone you love scares you. <br /> <br /> There are some things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able -bodied. To give someone silent permission to push a soccer ball directly to your head for the sole purpose of fit is one of them. (I once saved a fine from the school's mortar with my face, but I was before. It wasn't for acceptance.) To enter a barbrawl is another. Once again in the fact that your father is just a companion to you after you prove yourself to jump metaphorically through physical hoops, masochism takes a step too far. All these things are stupid and suffering by them as a way to demonstrate your bravery, make them no less foolish. <br /> <br /> So yes; Just because you overcome obstacles to accomplishing big things doesn't make you less. Being a good person is preferred; To set an inspiring example for the disabled, should appear on the list.
