As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I expected this one to be fantastic - and as far as the gorilla effects were concerned, it was pretty good - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims it is based on a real story, but it doesn't even come close to what actually happened to Buddy. Who in real life was the famous Gargantua, who was sold to Ringling Bros by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who had the best of her animal welfare. As far as Buddy is portrayed to be aggressive, it was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla use such behavior in real life. Buddy escaped into the house in a storm and escaped his wooden crate (not a soft room as shown in films) to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which Gertrude Lintz feared to sell him. No, Buddy is not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoo. He has long been left in the back of a garage with a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the store. circus - where he actually lived a better life with peanuts thrown at him until he died (previously a show in Miami, historically the oldest living gorilla). Also note how Buddy gets older in the movie, but the chimpanzees never get older. (The chimpanzees are not simultaneously portrayed with other animals, including Buddy, as in the movie)
