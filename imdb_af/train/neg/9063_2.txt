The fact that most of the budget was supposedly going to be on the heavyweight list, did not matter if it came with flair and imagination and sympathy for the original satirical intention. Instead, we probably get bad songs and dance series with picturesque beggars and whores. The final alienation is achieved by pointing out that the action took place on a music hall stage, appropriate enough for a production that is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair and Brecht. Acting talent is abusively abused: Migenes and Walters are good, but do not have to try very hard. People at least have a good voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but struggles with the character, hit by a fake blue accent. Harris's Peachum is embarrassing and Polly is horrible. The adaptations of lyrics, scripts and music are often uncomfortable: it was a bad move to base the movie on Marc Blitzstein's engaging Broadway version, but his words were at least singable, unlike most of what was in gestures of faithfulness has been interpolated. And the attempt to overcome the low budget by filming claustrophobic corners on the weathered hair, bumps into garish blues and oranges as if it were completely failed by a bargain cellar, Vittorio Storaro. The movie just looks cheap, clumsy and unnecessary. Disgraceful.
