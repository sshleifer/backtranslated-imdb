Wow! I remember so many horrible films being released from high school from the early eighties. They usually had an incomprehensible plot and many 27-year-old actors pretended to be students. While watching this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia in the 1980s. But then I find out that this film was made in 1989? What do you say! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, it's just bad. The plot prepared the city for a high school and threatened to drive all students to downtown high schools. What's strange, because the students at this school are both rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Wondering how they can't get money to keep this school alive, they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if students can raise $ 200,000. So the seniors are going to do it. Hmmm, you raise $ 200,000, but instead of saving it for college, are you heading for the salvation of high school that you are a senior? And why would they close an overcrowded school before the year ends? And ... ahh forget it, this movie was stupid and made in 1989!?
