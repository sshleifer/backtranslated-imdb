Brides die at the altar, and their bodies disappear. Everyone is worried, but no one seems to know why and how it happens, and neither can it happen. Be patient with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he exploits the spinal fluid of these young women to convince his old wife and keep her alive. Continue with me. Finally, the authorities find out that someone has to take death and disappearance, but of course they cannot find the unlikely motive. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and move on. If you get the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to Lugosi to hit his lab assistant to meet one of the brides he killed and explain that he sleeps in a coffin much more comfortably. as a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror movies (the kind with budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably the rude police nowhere to see!), And then the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and acting are OK. There are many well-dressed, very good people in this movie. The direction is fair, and the writing is a bit better than the material that is earned. Nonetheless, this film fails the interest of all but the most hardened b movie fan. The best thing about it .... It eventually ends, but not soon enough.
