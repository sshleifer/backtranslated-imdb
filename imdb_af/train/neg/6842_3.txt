"Paula, I can be a bitch, but I'll never be a bitch!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in an otherwise tough skin spot that contains a beautiful honey in Stacey Walker, but it's all about it. This gall is a real scourge that lures her boyfriends, co-workers and even her lesbian roommate Paula into her bedroom, but then it becomes a slap that calls "rape" and calls for the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified c ** t is interesting for a while, but this story eventually becomes a true recurring one-note affair. At least the end is worth the wait, for those who still care.
