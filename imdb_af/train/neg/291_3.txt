Movie version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman-off-Broadway show is ghastly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge performances and superstars, but her sense of irony is just interesting and funny. Her fans will say she is scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she is also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that is not well-suited to a movie in this genre. She does not want to be nice - and she is definitely not making friends - and many people will rub it in the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material is seriously lacking here. Film maker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and although not directed by him, the film has its cool, stand-alone signature style. Bernhard wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their strangest touch was that all of Sandra's own audiences were completely bored - a feeling that many real viewers would likely share. * 1/2 of ****
