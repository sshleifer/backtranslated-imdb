First, I won't tell you WHY I rented this movie, as I still have confused myself ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is much like any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked. There is, of course, the one important person on the plane, and the hijacker is looking for revenge. The sad thing is that some of the methods to stop the hijackers have been used in other films. Are we becoming so original as soon as possible? <br /> <br /> Though this is Ice-T (which for some incomprehensible reason is trying to do, while not bringing the "c" back before rap) that is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars less than the amazing Kim Oja as a "flight attendant" hostess. OVERVIEW by the five hijackers, who of course haunt them. Regarding the rest of the cast, Steve Hytner, known as Kenny Bania of Seinfeld, was the only person I could recognize. <br /> <br /> I can't forget my favorite part of The movie, when using a hijacker to use a POINT of PLASTIC to blow a door lock ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> The writing - horror. It came to the point where I could say something, what I felt would make a stupid comment, and that would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> As for special effects ... the only special thing about this movie is the cost of electricity wasting my TV and video recorder for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the movie took place in the air. But because of the less than star performances, the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to disassemble a movie just because it's bad. ONLY YOURSELF, don't choose it.
