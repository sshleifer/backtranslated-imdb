"Hey everyone! I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped thing out of outer space, so why don't we make it out and open it?" "Yes, I know this is the foolish thing a scientist can do, and it can be filled with polluting bacteria or viruses that are unknown on earth and possibly erase humanity, but hey, I want to know what's in it. " "And no one tells NASA, they can take it away from us." "Wow, this thing, give off vibes!" "Yes, very strong people who have contact, don't touch it, but it's okay to open it." "Hi there, look at my nipple". (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN" !!!!! Uh, we have to run to the lab and tell them not to open it, because we don't have cell phones or radios or intercoms, even though we have another gazillion dollar here. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, blades take this stick and hide it." "I'm leaving here, I don't care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one is me!" "Look, these are the friendly strangers of" The Abyss "! They want us to come with them." THE END
