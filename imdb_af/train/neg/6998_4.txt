Hollywood has always had problems with a "religious picture". Strange charge seems to be no exception. Although using the talents of an excellent film, and on a top budget, with a decent muddy photography by Robert Planck, the film fails to credibility. Perhaps the reason why the film seems so realistic is that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upset the viewer's involvement in the action and the fate of the characters. I found it hard to keep quiet by all the metaphors, parallel and biblical references, and impossible to accept Ian Hunter's alley-it-all as a Christian figure. And the sensors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few Boston / Detroit / Providence filmmakers, if any, complained or traveled to other cities, as it was clear from the trailer that Gable and Crawford were somehow involved in a "message photo." It falls everywhere. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the movie has something of a revival on TV. A home atmosphere seems to make the movie's allegory more receptive to viewers. Despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Alien Load flows along predictable, heavy moral lines that no one will guess how the main characters will eventually agree with the fate.
