First: I bought it from the video store. Second, I watched it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It wasn't funny. Fifth: Most of the antics were lame. And last but not least. It's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I'm a great Adam Sandler fan, despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I'm sorry because it was his first movie. Even if you're a great Adam Sandler fan, don't watch this movie. Instead, just take the video, board a hunt, and throw it overboard.
