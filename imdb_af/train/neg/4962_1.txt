99,999% pure crap. And the other .001% was a short moment where I thought the blonde chick would be ashamed. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary bad. The action sucked, and there was no sex (the aforementioned blonde chick was modestly dressed, unfortunately, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I ever saw on film, and the anachronism was numerous and scary. Acting was even mediocre from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only names in this movie. And Marina Sirtis really looked really bad. <br /> <br /> I watched high school plays being produced more capably. This is the kind of movie that MST3K threw on. Heads should roll on Sci-Fi to allow this steam roll on the air.
