It's the kind of movie that keeps my enemies happy, I look at it all over, but it's not bloody true. I just watch it once to make sure it's as bad as I first thought. <br /> <br /> Some type mixers hijack a Boeing 747. (This is at least an improvement due to Boeing chopping a good part of the Pentagon.) The plane goes off in the Bermuda triangle and sinks to the bottom, a kind of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> It has one of the all-star casts, the stars fall or barely above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're on our own!" said pilot Jack Lemon. He's so right. Except for George Kennedy. He's in all these disaster movies. <br /> <br /> Look at another movie instead. Oh, not "airport" the original. It's not good either. Rather look at a decent movie about airplanes like "Flight of the Phoenix."
