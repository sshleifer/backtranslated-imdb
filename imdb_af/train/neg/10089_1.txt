The German filmmaker, Ulli Lommel, was given a task that many of the frightened thought was impossible: he is unnoticed with Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of the director of the worst horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as cowardly and ridiculous as the worst of EW. I am both proud and ashamed to say that I have looked at it in an overly ill, fascinated way to see just how low the bar can be set. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the role of international nobodies. Only someone living in Los Angeles, where every car mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, can easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors for his ridiculous dialogue with a straight face to speculate. <br /> <br /> The main character, a shameful beatman, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Apart from being a serial killer, he is also LA's oldest police spokesman. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, they drag them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture store), and everything in the eyes of his newcomer partners clearly refuses. To investigate, go as far as physically attacking one of his accused in a ninja strike on his flat. <br /> <br /> The sets are ominously bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Since the actors were, of course, unpaid non-professionals - a sad variety of European emigrants (possibly deported when acting in their own countries), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and since there are few money spent on sets, special efx, places or other production value, it is just right to mention that they made spring for some straight police uniforms. Unfortunately, they couldn't afford a police car; More than half of the story focuses on the dirty acts of our disrupted German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially spicy because he is the only actor in this whole mess, with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits in right, with a rockabilly hairstyle and tortured Brando post that should be thought of. <br /> <br /> The latter part of the movie is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are raised after killing a girl who has just visited voodoo priestesses to play a protective game on her. farm. Don't ask why a girl from Romania will resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. <br /> <br /> After very long handcuffs of straw-covered road diggers, the zombie girls succeed to make their appearance. They look exactly like they did before death, perhaps even more beautiful, with a black glamor make-up that had been in the eye. At the moment in the film, Lommel borrows a creative note from his beloved countryman Boll, and injects huge doses of cheesy Euro-dirty technique into the soundtrack. We speak prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls talk and usually operate ... I mean, as they did before being zombified. This gives our author enough opportunities to let us down with more of his golden dialogue. Yes, a golden shower is it. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock. All I can say is perfectly in harmony with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood's spirit stays on ... or should I say his spirit.
