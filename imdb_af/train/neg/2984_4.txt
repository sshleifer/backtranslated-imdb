I admit that the majority of this movie was uninspired, but I was still entertained. It has a wonderful feeling of frenetic energy, above average music, and the women in the film defend themselves, there are no prices here. I can think of dozens of other films that were much worse. At least this one had an interesting plot line, along with some social commentary. They refer to how the army deals with viral epidemics, destroy everything, even if it means the people you are supposed to save. Also, how dangerous martial law can be, as democracy at that time ceases to exist. Fulci tried to combine his earlier work (zombie, outdoor, gates of hell) in an effort to improve in some way. He failed, but certainly not miserable, as a number of people would like to think. I have a soft spot for zombie movies, so I admit I'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I say is that this movie is good for once, if there wasn't so much distraction in making this movie (Complete and Bruno (I can do with the best of their hack) Mattei took over) This could be much better and have been more focused. It's going to stay in my collection as Fulci's Zombie-Swan song. One surprising note is that there is a scene in the zombie 3 that the cemetery man actually pulled off, I couldn't believe it myself, check it out, you'll be surprised.
