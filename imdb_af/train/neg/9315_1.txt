This movie was so bad! It was awful! It was awful! I can not emphasize it enough! The acting, directing, story, characters and everything about it were bad! It was so thin and clicked. Don't be fooled by the cover, or the tagline "The 'Texas massacre' is nothing to laugh about." Make a joke! It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie is good until it comes to the main character Brendan, OK, turn it off now. What I got from the movie was a bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people to a cabin in the middle of the forest and a clown who nursery rhythms singing, killing their original and false ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would also waste your money and time! Because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it wasn't worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time, it's seriously the worst movie ever! Review: Don't deserve one.
