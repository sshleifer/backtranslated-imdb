This movie is like the thousands of "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (The following might look like a fairy tale, but it actually just describes a big class of movies). There is the passionate, prudent main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his poorly placed attempts at humorous commentary, the initially hostile but soon-softened beautiful lady who elicits the inevitable "unlikely" love story, taken the loved ones hostage and of course the indifferent evil opponent with his brutal minions. Everyone has already seen tons of these movies, and "National Treasure" is like any of them, with just a slightly customized package. Every turn of the story is easily predicted (and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the barn). I'm quite tired of deceiving for money after leaving the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you've ever felt that way, notice my warning; stay away from this movie.
