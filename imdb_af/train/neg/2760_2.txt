I knew it was not Gunna between me and D wars from the moment we met. First the title was lazy. D war. As for writing, Dragon was too much for them. Also ... you can't really be so blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do what hell wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progress. Here is the film, dreamy reporter's reports of big snake tracks, flashing back to a time when he and dad were wandering in what had to be the shop for gremlins and dreamy child reporter found a box glowing. Old store remembers several terrible truths. That Bauraki was a bad snake was his chance to be a god. tells the child that he is a reincarnated warrior and that he is somewhere in LA his reincarnated lover and gives him a piece of jewelry. Winkel also knows that despite its obvious whiteness he is a 500 year old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, dreamy reporter remembers it perfectly and begins with half a mad trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks follows and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose. Why? Like dear reader if you have the balls. <br /> <br /> So Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flash. I have the benefit of an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts freaking out and making a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them, he tells me that anyone who made this movie has no idea what they are doing. She is a Korean legend and she is reincarnated from a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that night her dragon started teasing, she called the police because she seemed to have a heart attack. Look, in this mixed mad world they believe different heart attacks. The next time we see her, she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy. I now have a new phobia and that's when I'm in trouble, the first respondents will just assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of doubt with my hard mistress, Dwar. There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr. (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafe with a sassy black friend. In the scenes that preceded, Bauraki killed an elephant, flung a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. Look, people were scared to come out after 9-11 happened, but we have to run everything after the coffee and cakes decide to risk our lives. Business as usual, no way to make a giant snake, will stop me from getting my caffeine up. If I stay inside and fear for my life, the terrorists and snake-like deities win. <br /> <br /> After giving a satisfactory dragon on Helicopter battle, my brutal lover Dwar treats me to a pi $$ and vinegar-filled scene to end it all. Bauraki has a fort of his own and his right under LA I think. They don't really say, but dreamy reporter and Sarah are hit in a car accident that kills less men and when they wake up, Yep Dragon Palace. A little delayed dialogue later comes a good dragon snake from nowhere and the snakes struggle / love everything. And I don't make a good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think I'm blowing it out of proportion, I'm not, there is no question of this thing in the movie then suddenly ... there! A few seconds later and good dragon became dragon god, set Baurki on fire, Sarah became a ghost and joined Dragon-god, dreamy reporter who was left in the middle of nowhere role-credits. Thank you. <br /> <br /> Now our relationship is as rocky as it was, its good times. There was a man who looked like a shredder of tortoises and spoke exactly like an interlude of star wars. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He can do everything he wanted when he wants it, but can never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where it was not helpful. He can go into your dreams if it doesn't do well and he can burn ten random soldiers, but not when it matters. He was also allergic to touching those junk jewels. I love him because he's hit a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic raider sounds. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the actors were wonderful ... if it somehow meant terrible. Jason Behr, who I thought, was wonderful in Roswell, which I slowly find out, can only act one way and it's pretentious, generous and Patrick Dempsey "ish". <br /> <br /> The one thing I like about this dirty prostitute is Cross's main actor, Bauraki. The giant snake worked out his heart. I dare say he was better off playing a cgi serpentine demi god of evil, when John Barrymore played Richard the III or Hamlet. There was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from its smaller mortal supporting role. When he ate an elephant, I felt like no one was over, the present or the future would ever eat an elephant with such a feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature and he placed his heart and soul every second of this cursed project. Yes, this is me, my favorite actor in this movie was a cgi snake. Do I have the balls to admit it, do you? <br /> <br /> Here is hope that Bauraki gets more work and is not similar, that Jason Behr finds a variety of emotions other than dreamy, and that I never have to look at Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So, D War is over. I want my CDs back and let's just be friends
