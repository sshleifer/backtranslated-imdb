God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here), but what for really? The whole thing behind "Natural born killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how media can be in full trash, but unfortunately the movie itself is in the trash. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you want to use the fascism of TV shows to use violence to get high prices, avoid the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it denies media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways. How true ... He just forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this little bit of shit!
