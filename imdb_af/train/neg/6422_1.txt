"I just watched this movie last night and I don't think I'll ever think the same about any of the actors involved, because this movie will stay in my mind afterwards." <br /> <br /> The above statement can be regarded as a good or a bad thing. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of some good men, which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I will think of Tinseltown, which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I picked it up and thought it might be something intelligent or at least chuckle and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought it wouldn't be bad. You can say the movie was made on a budget of the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.) But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. WRONG. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT funny or entertaining in any sense. It's just there and lasts for 84 turbulent slow minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin. You almost give up NO of the characters, and since the lead, two struggling Hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream writing it, you need to know about it. Well, the two true writers know all about the screen versions of themselves, so their figure so does the audience. They don't even think about character development, except to tie the story back to "Gilligan's Island". <br /> <br /> The plot is original. Two guys live in a storage room, one of them storing a bed, and there are also about twenty other people there. The rest of the story is confronted and stupid. Did you see "National Lampoon's Favorite Deadly Sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a TV writer who can't find a good story to make a TV movie, so he creates one. Now replace the TV writer for a screenwriter, Morph Mantegna, after the annoying actors, half his age, and take the comedy away and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie. She's still hot, but it will help if she's actually STANDING in a movie, rather than making CAMEOS constantly. Like everyone else, I don't think it was the actor error, because they have BAD material. <br /> <br /> Look at the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from this movie.
