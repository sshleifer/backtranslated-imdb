Look, there's nothing spectacular about this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with an end you can see coming before you've seen as much as the trailer. The main difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with white and lack of pretension. This movie has no pretense, but it really has no sense of movement, you feel like you can get up and go at any moment. The production of the movie also has the feel of a debut film made about fifteen years ago. I would recommend seeing a classic movie like when Harry Met Sally imitates this level. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael's cute like Vaughn in Alias, you'll be seriously disappointed with the way they look.
