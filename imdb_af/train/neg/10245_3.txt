I expected a lot from this movie. Just like Lee as a Naustadamous kind of character, but all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can't even explain this movie. It had woodworking, horrible scriptures from the Bible, such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But it was at the end! The rest I had to wait and hope something significant would happen, but it didn't. This movie is about a few who are trying to get the changes going, such as in China where there was an earthquake and finally at a monastery run by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery is the key to the crimes. The whole movie is deceptive and boring. One of Read's worst.
