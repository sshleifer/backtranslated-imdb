It's the worst, and I mean the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is completely unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The man in this movie can actually talk to the computer as a real person. Now you probably think it should be a super cool high tech computer. Well, it is, but it also does it with other very poor and weak computers that don't even have graphical interfaces. <br /> <br /> And the main idea of ​​overloading the "super" computer by connecting it through computer games on the net is really stupid. My phone will turn off the lighting to conserve energy, but apparently this genius computer can't decide to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to download computer games. <br /> <br /> There are also some other bad things about it, but I just don't have time for it. <br /> <br /> I just can't believe anyone can actually record movie stupid, as it does
