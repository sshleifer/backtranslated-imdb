I agree with other users' comments because the two main roles were good, this is the man who played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Actually, the story was so boring. Not heard from the story I didn't know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but how wrong I was. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about their mother and father. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the father would lose his temper. This was the only interest I got from this drill festival.
