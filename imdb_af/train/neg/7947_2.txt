Seeing this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently it wasn't. I have no idea how this movie is allowed to appear on that site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful of all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts with a man with a scroll roll with a signia stamped on it. He breaks the seal and some disasters happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans die, the moon turns red, and so on. <br /> <br /> The female character was also annoying. Many of the things she did didn't make sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, this is the date on which she will receive birth from her baby, and she begins to start about it and investigates it and asks religious people who mean it all. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <The two worst things that happened in this movie are the performance of a mentally handicapped man who claimed that God had told him to kill his parents and the end where Demi Moore died after giving birth to her baby and conveying her soul over it. br /> <br /> Here's what happens. The mentally disabled person is shot dead and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore arrives in a hospital in the midst of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her child's head and transfers her soul into the child and then dies. Then stop the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? He becomes furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally handicapped man, then it is all about forgiveness when a lonely woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. This is another religious end of the world propaganda piece. The acting of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is excellent. That's about everything there is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good acting with lots of nonsense!
