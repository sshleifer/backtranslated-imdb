This movie is just awful, the eye candy that Ben plays can only make everything wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Author / director / producer / chief actor etc. probably has a good idea to make a movie about the major issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and about every other issue that a gay man of these times brings about, but tries to ram each issue into such a poorly developed movie. little fairness for any of these causes. <br /> <br /> The writing is poor, decisive, but dialogue and acting are only discouraged. The gay-hating brother is played by most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main players (I think I've seen more passion in a wheat flake). The play is stiff, and the dialogue forced (a scene where the brother feeds the detective, his lines were the highlight). <br /> <br /> I'm just happy to see that the creator of this train wreck has pushed any other garbage to distribution, and if he does, I have some advice. DO NOT.
