The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with accidents, accidents and destruction, mostly by Stan, but with Ollie the bulk (!) Received from the penalty - see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or ' In a hole (1932), like some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here's for some reason (because it's based on a sketch by Stan's father) Do the boys play it straight "in a" comedy "built around jokes and so-called funny situations. It doesn't come down. It's just another deadly 30-year-old comedy that is only increased by the personality of Stan and Ollie, which never shows any of their brand gestures (Ollie's finger wraps, Stan's blind stars, etc.) or comic abilities. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with those who run the police. Since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept that they are afraid of being caught, hiding in Colonel Buckshot's mansion. The point of departure for the humor, Ollie leaves him when Colonel and Stan leave him when both the butler and the maid are never very encouraging. They don't play 'Stan and Ollie' in this movie. Their parts could be played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor. Stan could mimic and do whatever he wanted, but he didn't get the chance to do it. any of these here. He is limited by expressing too much dialogue to "move" the plot, but none of it rises much above the stupid. We are treated to endless, third-class comedy castles, such as the running gag not to name the Lord Plumtree correctly, the "Call me a taxi! Oh, you're a taxi!" joke, policemen lose their clothes and are seen in long johns and a non-consecutive end of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully clear horse costume while escaping on two for two and James Finlayson is still doing his take continuous quiet time and Keystone Head jumpers. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie are doing much better in a situation comedy in 'Son of the Desert' (1933) where we see they do what we do about them - be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 looks their best years. <br /> <br /> Since this movie doesn't play any of their strengths, why does it save it? I need to give it a 3.
