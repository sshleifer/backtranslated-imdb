First, I really loved Henry Fool, who puts me in a very small pool of moviegoers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this film was a full-fledged one. Watching Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the extras - so full of pride, and making meaningful analogies to Star Wars - was stomach twist. It was hype on the producer part (HDNET) realized to the maximum. A true example of the emperor and his new clothes. Usually I feel that Hal has always spoiled HENRY FOOL. I don't think I can ever see it again, because it is pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, sometimes you can relax some of the people ... etc. The director won't be anywhere. today as everything he did, the meaningless garbage was separated. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of the lesson learned in the film ADJUSTMENT. The story must be exciting and active, or its hope in the box is indeed dull. Never be a decent story. For the actors it was like trying in a strait jacket. <br /> <br /> The score, I believe Hartley's, is tasteless. With drumming hits all over the dialogue. There was one Apple Soundtrack loop I recognized that gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to grab a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I'd like to spoil this movie for you, but it's done. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
