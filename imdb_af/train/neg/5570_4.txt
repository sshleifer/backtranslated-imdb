Let's appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: A relaxing script typed thousands of times by unconscious people before typewriters. Pathetic play quizzed by the story ... OK production value, including good set / place and beautiful girl .. rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the movie has no social message. it's thought free .... but if i pretend i was 10 and my iq was 70. i feel the message is: don't be afraid to love? rating 0/10 <br /> objectionable things: nothing special, just the gentle Jewish hedonic and arrogant attitude presented by the writer / director. overall, good, nothing degeneration -8/10 <br /> overall rating is 4/10
