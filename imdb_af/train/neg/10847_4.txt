The director-cut version, which was the one I saw, was very long for this kind of movie. Almost two hours are far too long. If you have the choice, definitely go to the non-directors. <br /> <br /> The main grave is almost not recorded at all, the film is made up of the bulk of several murder scenes, which are connected but The feeling is that they are only shown to fill the movie with devastating violence . The connection is not announced until the last part and the lack of context has long bored me before I was there. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, it doesn't work. You never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general attitude (character is presented, 15 minutes later is character dead). These photos strong side lies in the splatter part.
