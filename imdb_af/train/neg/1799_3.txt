Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a messy metal kid picked up. When his favorite bad 'metal' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a gruesome fitness of all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets an undisclosed record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. He is first sucked into revenge behavior, but then he doesn't want it as far as Sammi does. It's not really as far as his main victims go to the hospital. This film is completely laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as it says, "Rock Star". OK, maybe a little more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. And how ANYONE can root for a man played by Skippy from "Family Ties". I have no idea. The grace of Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne achieves coherence, I rejoice for that, but skip it otherwise. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Biscuit: Elise Richards becomes topless, a topless extra at a pool party
