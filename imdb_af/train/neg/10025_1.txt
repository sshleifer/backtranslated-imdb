If it is a 2008 product of one of the largest production houses of the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj), then I fear it is very long before we reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can go so far with such an enormous mortality of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then movies are still being studied much harder by everyone involved in this movie. The film is lacking in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. He has some good dialogues to make, but it alone can't make you enjoy a movie with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car coming down a mountain from the mountain has many cheap graphics like those of a cartoon movie. This was a clear indication of the director's vision. Every actor who is otherwise an asset to a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's gimmick of good English tries to flatten most of the times. And Saif will surely hit himself and think why he signed this movie. <br /> <br /> In short, this is the biggest waste of resources to "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a better enjoyable movie than this. <br /> <br /> One cannot understand how and why this type of script is written and approved. The most undesirable was the rebound sequence of Akshay's love story. After the faulty writing, the worst point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar just gave a few filler songs to each song. The songs start very well and suddenly the songs fall drastically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good of everything in the lot. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> With regard to the continuity intelligence of the makers, you should only do the following: Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of ​​a strange location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene they search for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car. I still think who wrote it. <br /> <br /> If you manage to settle to the last, the climax is too long with stupid and unnecessary stunts. You can see all the heroes running through the storm of bullets that were not hurt as if they were God. Do we still see a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved? No more words about this pathetic and downgraded film, but a sincere request to senior actors of their fan. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar. If possible, please request a preview of your movies after their first copy. is out. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your supporters and viewers. People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this kind of movie shouldn't be seen in the daylight, as it both detracts from the reputation of everyone related to the movie, the actors and the production center.
