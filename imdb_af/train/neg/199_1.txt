It's a horrible movie, horrible script, bad direction and nonsense end. Also, bad performances, except for Clancy Brown who is underutilized by criminals, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was a purgatory - you do it to leave enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one. <br /> <br /> The movie offers a father and son who don't seem to be able to relate to each one. The part of the male lead is not well written and looks uncharacteristic in this role. You can see the plot points a kilometer further. The actions of the female head and that of her brother, the policeman, also do not make sense. So, a big action on her part at the end of the movie doesn't make sense.
