Lame plot and two-dimensional manuscripts look like cardboard cuttings. Needless to say, it made it difficult to experience empathy for any of the characters, especially the fiancee; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In summary, I think you could say it was on par with your typical TV drama. It uses just about every cliché in the book. The tortured classic musician who wants to break out and play salsa. She doesn't love the free-fiancé engaged in a "bean bank" personality. I won't list them, otherwise it would be a fairy tale because I gave away the whole plot. The dance was OK, but nothing special. I saw worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was very strict. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I didn't pay good money to see it at a theater. I'm still a little shocked at how much good reviews this movie has earned.
