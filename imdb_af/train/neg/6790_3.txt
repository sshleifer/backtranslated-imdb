Ohhh the brutality, ohhhh the dying race, ohhh the sense of loss, ohhh the bias! Jeez, when is this all you want revisionists to stop analyzing the Western to cry out loud? S ** t happen. If this impedes your socially manipulated sensitivity, go back to the convenience of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, boring and very tiring celluloid waste especially in the light of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen's presence. Nothing interesting or intriguing here unless you are obsessed with the 19th century desert dentist. Perhaps a little better without the constant distraction of the extravagant Mexican man with the bad tooth. A monument to the stupid ultra left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70's. Almost impossible to put through the whole movie. I think I'd rather open my eyes to the whole Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 Horses / 10s all decade hell.
