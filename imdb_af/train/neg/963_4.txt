'Chances is a big mistake to see. You can know director Emile Ardolino of 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and expect something entertaining from him. But I think I should disillusion you. He made a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies as a baby to burn. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr., and Jr returns his former hometown where she met his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, how?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then Jr's former wife, Cybill Shepherd, appears and Jr falls in love with her too. I don't think I should even mention that she likes Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr. is at its worst. He copied Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After the Moonlighting Shepherd proved she was not fit for acting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is one thing that this unfunny comedy can use: as an antidote to insomnia.
