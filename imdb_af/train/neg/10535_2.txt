<br /> <br /> According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20-year-old college kids who want to enter their graduate school. Jolly joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The synthesizer keyboard has not been invented yet, but it is on the tape stand. The Ford Pony Car has not been invented yet, but there are old music playing. The synthesizer was a model of the mid-1970s. The Pony Car at its best is from the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> 20-year-old college kids? Josh Brolin saw 32 birthdays when this made TV movie was produced. <br /> <br /> The plot is so predictable that viewers have enough time to think of all the errors that appear on their TVs.
