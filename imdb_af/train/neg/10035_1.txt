Absolutely horrible movie. Continuous waste of time. <br /> <br /> background music is so loud that you can't understand speech. Well, if you really listen well, all they talk about is actually incomprehensible. Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives headache, action is unashamed, dialogs are incomprehensible. Well, Kareena looked like a wrestler, now it looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell you can slack, but you can't get grace. <br /> <br /> After watching a movie for three hours, I'd like it, but this movie won't even allow me the pleasure. <br /> <br /> If you want to torture yourself, watch it now.
