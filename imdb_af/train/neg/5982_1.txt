I'm very sorry to say that, but "Thunderbirds" don't even come with a loud pop, no matter what. At one point, I seriously considered going out of the theater, and I stayed in the lost hope that the movie might improve. I was disappointed, it didn't get any better, it got worse if it wasn't possible at all. If I went to see the movie with the idea that it would be a "spoof", I would still drop. They had an excellent opportunity to make a huge franchise here, they totally messed up the event. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be ashamed to have names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes well, what can I say, he should be ashamed and ashamed would not be far from the truth. I watched this movie at a preview, and I waited to see it in the sixties with the original performances. To say I was disappointed would be something of an understatement. One last thing I would say about the movie was the dolls in the TV show were just a little more wood than the actors in the movie.
