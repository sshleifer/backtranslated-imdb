This is probably the best horror movie ever since Ed Wood died. <br /> <br /> I can't spoil the end because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll try my best. There are some lesbian vampires, but they keep changing bodies, so any character may or may not be the character you are supposed to think, or it may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters makes sense to start with. There is no plot, no character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never again heard. There are also zombies, which may be the enemies of the vampires, but there is also a dream-within-a-dream kind of order in a mental hospital, so maybe that doesn't really happen and that's all the main characters hallucination. <br /> <br /> The upside down? Both of the head girls briefly take off their shirts. The special effects are simply staggering (I especially like the incredibly slow, uncomfortable battle sequence). Everyone has a very foolish Canadian accent, which adds to the overall level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> The price of rent is well worth it. We laughed until we cried.
