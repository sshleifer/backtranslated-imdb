Those reviewers like this movie surprised me. The plot is a bump. The characters are wood. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and they all misjudge. No one has a quality or interest in interest. It's not an edgy job. It is not imaginative. It's not ironic. It's not smart. There is nothing straight on this tedious job. It's missed theater release is not surprising. That the "This Network" air, reduces the room. I definitely recommend making a repeat of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good information session if you received this excellence on late night television. If you experience it on television on television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better if you have not suffered from these shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.
