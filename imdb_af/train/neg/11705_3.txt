This splendid melodrama is pretty much the worst movie that Ingrid Bergman faces, which I have seen. Even her vivid screen presence cannot save this insatiable slow and winding movie. It's almost impossible to go through without moving much forward. <br /> <br /> Only for hard Bergman fans; others will most likely fall asleep. I suggest you look instead of "For whom the Bell Tol".
