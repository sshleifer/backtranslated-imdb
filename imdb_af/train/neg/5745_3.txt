This film was the recipient of the 1990 Oscar Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the past few weeks, I've seen dozens of nominees and recipients of this award for the past 30 years and I really think this movie might just be the worst of them all - but it wasn't just a nominee, but won it !! I assume that 1989 was just a horrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a group of characters that look a little like cute uncles. It seems to be simple articulation figures that are shifted using stop motion animation. Everyone is identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each one has a different number on their back. They all stand on a large platform that is suspended, as if restrained, in space. Each one has a pole and they are also a box on the platform. The platform starts to tilt slightly and in response the men move in an attempt to balance the platform. It goes over and over and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them does some nasty work at the end, but it's just not enough to make this fun to look at the least. Apart from sensible stop motion animation, this card doesn't matter to me .... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the big short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a BIG short and was much better than any of the nominees that year or the previous year. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has led to a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny, it seems almost criminal to ignore it. Can't Pixar import it? It seems unlikely.
