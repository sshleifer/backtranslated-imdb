I watched horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then I have seen good horror movies and bad, but it is without a doubt the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus, it was just gore. I can stomach a lot of blood, but it was just ridiculous! In one of the screens, a character is stabbed in the back and choked with his bowels! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this movie is it's boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end is just stupid. But then again with the rest! In the end, when the girl gets away from the cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old woman makes tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She changed into a cannibal! Delayed movie.
