Yes, definitely better than my performance from the Death Tunnel. Actually, some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent. It was a kind of wrong turn with the hills having eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When the "kids" (high school or college?) in the kitchen discuss horror movies, everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about the big breast girls etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Wasn't Steve a bootleg Randy from Scream? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what did the movie have to do with Samhain in the film? Nicely unnecessary if you ask me. I find it humorous when I see those horror movies of the 80s sticking loose points by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow they made a Sam Raimi reference! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters have nothing to do with nothing. And he's so psychic that he can't even see his OWN death? 6.) When Gary was murdered in the bathroom (at that time, death only became Troma-licious) how could she hear the screams when she was down, but didn't hear when she was standing outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis - it's mainly a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is if you are like Shae and have no fun or crack a smile The whole movie, you will be the one who lives? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like the dishes from Chili con carne. <br /> <br /> 10. When they brought Gary's sister in, they forgot that Steve HAD was trapped there and wondered where he was going? 11.) Wasn't there more than one killer? Shae knocked that one, but never faced them again. <br /> <br /> 12.) What were the flashbacks for the other people? Half of them. Shae didn't know if they were dead or alive, so what was that? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why didn't anyone ever call the police? And apparently everyone knew the people were living in the bush, why didn't they ever organize a kind of attack? 15.) As far as I know, they weren't zombies OR vampires - so how could she end? I'm with everyone on the giant "huh?" at the end. <br /> <br /> Better than the dead-toned, but rather sloppy. I still don't understand why they even put it in Ireland, as Samhain had almost nothing to do with the plot.
