I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was shocked by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography I saw. The story line is hidden too many graphic sex scenes - and not one is at least a little erotic - the more the feeling is sick. The director apparently went on shock, rather than exploring the different levels of what these characters look like. See it if you can stomach it - I still have flashbacks.
