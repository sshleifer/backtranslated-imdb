This movie is a pathetic attempt to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they throw a 19-year-old - well, probably not "to do it." There was no way they could have been 12 or 13 years old as the boy, because love shows would have all wiped out (if they even allowed them to do so) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my cousin's age, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile does not have to include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I really don't care about her education or her unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students for whom she did not live. The reason is that she is bipolar, rejects the diagnosis and refused to take her medication. So it's understandable that she doesn't think rationally. One hopes that she understands her actions now. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she is and think clearly about her medication. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, Penelope Ann Miller was completely convincing and perfect for the role.
