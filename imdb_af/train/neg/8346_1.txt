The title had to be the hiker. The man spends 90% of the film run. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Go through life to steal people's identity for nothing. He gets no benefit, no money, nothing does as if he is another person. <br /> <br /> No body could understand why he pretended to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing clear in this movie is that he loves his dad and was a good boy. But the rest was crazy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director is a loser who wants to be someone else. But what he really has to do is get real, because after his movie I don't believe he can make a movie maker.
