I don't understand Haneke's top average film skills. For example, I appreciate its urgent on unbeatable-natural-day-lit settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. Regarding the content of this film, however, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a desire to condemn domination - mutual relationships or feelings (and / or BDSM practices). The problem the main character has with her mother is incredibly topical, such as the alienation and misunderstanding that Walter felt (I do not mean the frustration of a lover who is not loved the same way, it is understandable, I mean it look at her as if she was crazy, or as if he were a monk, come on!). I mean D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's pretty stupid to treat the subject as if it were something "freakish" or pathological. it is not. Generally speaking, films dealing with this subject are really behind the times. <br /> <br /> So, for me, I feel that this movie is finally quite a programmatic movie, concerned with many outdated psychoanalytic theories (isn't it "almost embarrassing?"), and it doesn't really relate to real life experiences of those involved in D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chat rooms, even recent scientific studies will show).
