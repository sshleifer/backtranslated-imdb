It's really the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how somebody has the audacity to post it on release. <br /> <br /> The production standards are horrible. There is no pretension here in cinematography. The camera work, mini-dissertation, acting and sound are incredibly scratchy. I think there's a plot, but it could be done within 10 minutes, saving us time to see it. The hysterical neurotic girls in the middle of this piece have no credibility whatsoever. <br /> <br /> I would urge anyone to avoid any time or money on this Title. It's really horrible. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
