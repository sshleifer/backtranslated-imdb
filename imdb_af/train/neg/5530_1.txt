The many problems with this movie are the worst continuity; and it edited many years ago on VHS for a university cable channel, I tried to find out exactly what went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they have actually constructed a much longer movie and then cut it down for standard theater viewing. How long? To fill in all the holes in the plot, as it requires about three hours of narration and character development, especially since the film we have is just as slow and just as serious. <br /> <br /> It's staggering; what can the Halperins try to achieve here? Their previous film, White Zombie, was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate the early Universal Studios monster films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and as such close to the zombie mythology that North American would know about. popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The uprising of the Zombies, on the contrary, seems to be meant as an allegory for the politics of the modern war. It will not only explain the opening and changing of Dean Jagger's character in a megalomania, but it also explains why the zombies don't really do much in the movie, except to stand around, look scary and wait for orders - They 'I'm just equal to anyone who is not in my aversion to the modern war and his politics - but I think a movie should be first, and only later, perhaps, educational. And definitely - a movie about zombies should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood history, but not one I can recommend, even for historical value.
