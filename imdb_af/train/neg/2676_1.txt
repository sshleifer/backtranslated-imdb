** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This straight-to-video mess combines a weapon-winning heroine, Grade Z effects, Nazis, a mummy and endless lesbian footage and it's still boring ; The video's 45 minutes run just like Eternity. The only good part is one of the bluer exits, in which the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptian into a chair - and one crook almost gets crushed under a chair leg. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch television, golf, bowling or tennis.
