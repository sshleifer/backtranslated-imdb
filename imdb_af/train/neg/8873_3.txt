Did anyone stop realizing what kind of movie they were producing here? Now let's say a former marine officer is named for a group of kids at a cadet school so it should be a family comedy? Wrong . It's just a brutal comedy aimed at teenagers with very bad moments. It could have been extremely stupid at this point, but I found Damon Wayans voice irritable. Does he talk like this in real life? If he does, he has my sympathy, but he doesn't get any of my money to watch his movies
