I am always frustrated by films that are obviously written by one generation. Especially when they obviously do not do enough research to find out when something is not just true, but little blatant. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his soccer teammates that he's conceived Diane. In no way, form or form will a guy ever get another old courage to get a girl pregnant at high school. They may be discouraged about the man who has sex with the hot cheerleader, but I can also assure that the first one who heard the soccer team will not be at a urinal. <br /> <br /> It was clear that this movie doesn't "take that seriously, and it wasn't terribly bad, but come on!
