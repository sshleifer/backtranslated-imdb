In a nutshell: it's a cookie cutter romantic comedy that's really WANTS and TRIES to be something more. That is Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. It wants to be deep and humble. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give the feeling of an important movie. The dialogue is smart - sometimes. There are a few "laugh out loud" moments. <br /> <br /> But here it is that seems to be something more than a formal late night cable, in flight, killer: <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - how many times can Joe sad puppy dog ​​stare in space with his jaw that opens before it becomes irritating? Maybe a drop would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - she's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role is supposed to be this vibrant, beautiful, caring girl who finds herself only in the wrong situations. This is very confused as a result and therefore a sadness such as Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very boring. Combine it with a puppy-drop-face (top) and you have very little chemistry to surrender. <br /> <br /> (I looked at someone else in this role - for example, Kate Hudson.) <br /> <br /> 3. The script and the plot - the things that happen are not true; all the problems are finally wrapped up with such a neat and neat bend on top that it seems that a whistle blows and the writing writers just said "oops, time to wrap it up, has a train to catch!" So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked all the boxes and went home.
