I searched this movie for some reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time - up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horror. However, I was disappointed because although the film was indeed bad, it never approached the levels of horror of some of its earlier shocking films. As a result, this movie was not very nice to watch for our bad movie lovers. <br /> <br /> Now, I was careful to watch this movie, as the title "Naughty Stewardesses" sounds like a porn movie - something I won't review on IMDb. However, this movie sometimes occurs - especially the first 10 minutes. But you can say that the script has undergone a lot of changes, because for many of the movie there is no title at all and by the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of nothing where it is violent and definitely NOT sexy not! The result is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not many parts are good. For example, as a porn video, it is surprisingly few and it is incomprehensible why they would put a 71-year-old man in some of the love stories. Certainly, for a 71-year-old, Mr. Livingston, he looked pretty good, but he was still an old man and no one wanted to see him, with young novelty! Then, if the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingston becomes a Rambo-like man! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to surrender and the movie even goes in a nasty title like 'Naughty Stewardesses'.
