Living in the Middle East (in Israel) I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syria. When I saw the trailer and I was a thriller lover, I expected to first see a fast moving, breathtaking movie, sensible in global policy making and the relationship between oil, power and corruption of a new one. move down corner. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, the intertwined editing made the logic very difficult to understand, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you don't mind. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
