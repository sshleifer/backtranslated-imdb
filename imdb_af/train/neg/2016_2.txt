***** Warning: Can contain SPOILERS ********* My big problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self-consuming the adulteress is! After one night standing with a smart psycho she stalked him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night. He is extremely crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she just thinks he's dangerous to her (and to her secret). Not for a second did she ever have a thought of her husband! Did she even think for a moment he might be in danger of this psychotic? Once she realized how sensible he was, she had to see her husband, no matter what the consequences. Maybe there wasn't a movie, but there really wasn't one, so what's the difference.
