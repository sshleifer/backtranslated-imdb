The overheated plot of Bonjour tristesse was taken from a young first novel by Francoise Sagan, who became a bestseller, although God knows why. For teens who want to get rid of a possible stepmother, it may have a certain occupation. Don't be overtaken by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the stepmother prospect. Unfortunately, too much is left on Jean Seberg's weakened shoulders. She is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is she can strike, but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St Joan-Seberg's first movie - she was not able to be 19 of a movie. This film, also by Preminger, meets the "promise" of the first. It was her second movie; she was 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr can compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is in the middle of the story and, although she is convinced that she is physically 17 years old, she cannot satisfy the emotional demands of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she didn't influence her consciousness in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this movie is better than mediocre needs a taste check. Despite Niven and Kerr, it is a youthful story performed in youthful fashion by a beautiful young girl who needs poorly active lessons.
