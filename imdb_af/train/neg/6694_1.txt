I actually hoped for this movie because I saw Kari in a few other things and she thinks she has talent. Unfortunately, this dud is a case study that should not be done in a script. Totally undefined characters without a narrow congratulation, and no plot whatsoever. Is it a road / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, and we do not.
