There are two types of characters on the screen: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and those who relentlessly pursue their own self-interest and commit every mortal sin can, while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes and everyone's only hope. More than any other show, the SKIEL is about hypocrisy and self-deception. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-confidence are the show heroes, and as such, the typical genre fiction heroes have an unlikely immunity to defeat or be captured and they come out over and over and make fools out of all their peers <br /> < br /> The display boasts excellent camera work. The prospects and blurring outs are always excellent. It's really a work of art to see. Unfortunately, the story is a cartoon, overwhelming wish fulfillment scenario of free violence, rape and lies. <br /> <br /> The hero, who, along with him in a failed scheme, tows to a failed scheme, is like a warner-brittle cartoon character, who always escapes and enjoys all the elder fads (anyone who doesn't in his lies and crimes), which automatically attracts an attractive woman supporting character to come to the show, always trying to bring him to justice, surviving, and always scraping your ears with his ominous self-defenses. If another police finds something wrong with something he does, and someone is hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious policeman, regardless of the fact that his schemes and lies and doomed plans are always the cause. Every time. <br /> <br /> Like 24, this show relies on turmoil and countless delays to pull off the season's season story. Drilling, incredible long-term stories are injected into the storyline every season to give a skeleton that hangs the bloody, twisted pieces of meat, which is the characters' corrupt deeds and the inevitable cover. <br /> <br /> Most disappointing, however, is the authors 'hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathy to form the characters on the borders. Sometimes they want us to see Shane as the enemy. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor, wrong soul. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a lower apostate Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her and talk about her dreams with Shane, we will find her sympathetic and tragic. <br /> <br /> None of this manipulation is enough to get the kind of sympathy they want. . Once they have shown that these characters are destroying other people's lives for their own purposes, it is. It is nonsense to keep trying to go back and forth. But then it's also nonsense to produce seven seasons of this bumbling clowns drawing each supermodel into their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right underneath everyone's nose.
