I only saw this movie on a local TV station (TV8's Big Chuck and Little John in Cleveland, Ohio). I have never heard of this movie and have decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I know of no thesaurus It can even be close to helping me describe how bad this movie really is. The writing is terrible. The acting, except for one of two exceptions, is useless, since there is nothing in this material that will make any real effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like a lot of little ideas, remnants from different scriptures, where it's thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. The "parody" aspect is strained at its best. Some references are almost obsolete (even for the time of release). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything that expressed Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even live color in their worst days. <br /> <br /> Watching it on TV is a great example of NOT making a movie. Whatever you do, DO NOT WASTE ANYTHING. <br /> <br /> Adam
