First, I agree with a little what Mr. Chomsky's mouth escapes. His actual delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus. He comes across nice, unattractive, pragmatic. He does not cater for the current political style (stupid bi-partisanship) and he draws his attention to the left as well as the far right, chastening both, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is a dud. In fact, I wouldn't even call it a documentary, but rather a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without a Break" is no different than watching a speaker on a 3-hour tape on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no modifications, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically, production is strictly amateur. Audio is terrible and inconsistent; Sometimes we can't hear Noam talking, other times we can't hear the questions put by the attendees. When Noam rarely speaks, we are allowed to see the reaction of the audience, unless we get a quick shot from his wife who believes each of his speeches and beams prides itself every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie and will say you're probably better off watching his stuck speeches on cassette or CD to listen in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a generous mood today.
