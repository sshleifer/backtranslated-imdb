This movie manages to be one of the most unique movies you have ever seen. However, it comes from the fact that you can't make head or tail of this mess. It's almost like a series of challenges to determine if you're willing to leave the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel like you are going through this horrible movie and developing a real sense of pity for the actors involved. They all saw better days, but then they realized they had paid a little money. to do this and you'll be sorry for them as you've already done for the movie. I can't go far enough about this horrible movie, it's almost something Ed Wood would have made and in that case it would probably be his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To get started you are forced through an opening dialogue you've never seen / heard, this thing must be five minutes long. In addition, it is said that you cannot read the viewer. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the obstruction of terrible lines are going on, it's as if he's just running to line up on the movie poster tagline. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I usually enjoy, and he does his best not to drown in it, but eventually he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid plays an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she still gets movies in movies, but I think she should like films of the American cake type. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can only see it for yourself when it comes to video, I know I have a kick out of it, I mean, everyone is honest here, sometimes it is comforting to ignite in the shortcomings from others.
