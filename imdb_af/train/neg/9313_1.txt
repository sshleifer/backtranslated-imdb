It was by far the worst low budget horror movie I've ever seen. I'm an open minded man and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, if I rent movies, I'm looking for good, understated horror movies. They are always good for a laugh, I think I know, I saw a lot. But this movie was just so horrible that it wasn't worth a chuckle. I considered switching it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There's nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d A $$. The intro was stupid like the end. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, don't watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
