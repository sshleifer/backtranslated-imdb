This movie was absolutely horrible. I can't think of one thing well. The plot holes were so large that you could manage a Hummer through them. The acting was so stubbornly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and it says a lot !!! And dialogue, Which dialogue? To think that I was a fan of the first one (I'd rather use the comments, it's more than a guilty pleasure, than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it to cry out loud !! Nothing good can come of this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad you can't even see a lot of friends having fun! It must be in my top five worst movies. 2/10 because it's so hard for me to give 1.
