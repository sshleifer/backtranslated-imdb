I see what the director is trying to do, but he missed the point. The main actor was really good, but editing for his moments takes you out of it. The camera works, ie lighting and exhibitor is a kind of amateur I could forgive if the direction was more fluent, but it wasn't. The sound was a bit off and it also takes you out of the movie. I can see that this director does a little better in the future, so not a total right, but don't expect a DVD movie almost as good as 28 days later or anything, keep your expectations low and you'll have more Get It Out. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yes and different from the head, the play was pretty bad if you asked me. But I'm a snob movie, so that's what it's worth.
