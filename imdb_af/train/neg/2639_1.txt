First start this review with the fact that I just wrote the review and warned people to save their money! <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst pieces of waste I've seen since The Hulk. The storyline was the most predictable garbage you might have encountered. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, the expectation immediately flushes with the money you will use for a ticket. You can enjoy so much more. The play was horrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "turn" in the end. I have to say it. The end surprised me. I'm not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the hassle-free way they could have seen the ONLY scene of somewhat decent action in the whole movie, they rushed the end so quickly that I didn't even realize it was over until I saw the credits and at that time I had Consider burning the movie of the movie if I could just figure out how to get into that showroom. <br /> <br /> Casting was terrible for a few reasons, first of all, they had to accidentally switch character assignments , because Michael Douglas played the role of CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland, while Douglas was sneaking agents, hitting telephone lines, catching up with systems, and pulling out people chasing him, Sutherland played the less competent agent who is always in ab. ad mood even when things are not so bad for him. He plays a very mere agent, such as his Jack Bauer type, we love 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can only promise that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It may be best compared to a remake of "The Fugitive" / "In The Line of Fire", but written by people with mental disabilities
