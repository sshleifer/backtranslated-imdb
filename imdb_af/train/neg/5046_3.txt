Lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that dies the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman who joined China in 1928, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunited with a former lover now working for Japan. Every piece of drama and forward movement of the story is sucked dry by director Ye Lou's somnambulis director style. Characters stand quietly for a few minutes and say nothing, hand cameras stick to faces forever that show inevitable responses longer than they need, changes repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and is given little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, sharing interaction through quiet dances but no clear emotional intimacy. A lot of sleep-inducing film.
