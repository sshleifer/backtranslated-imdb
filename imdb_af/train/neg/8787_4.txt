I first heard of White Noise when I saw the TV ad. Earlier I didn't even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and decided I was going to see it. I'm a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton in it, and he rocks. Unfortunately, the film didn't deliver. It tried to be another sixth sentence or a rudder of echoes, and failed. It had a very promising start, but the waist just dragged on to repeat itself, ending with a completely weak twist that any monkey found. Unfortunately, most of the "Scary" movies nowadays have loud sounds and buttons to make the audience jump. This movie could have been so much more. It is a pity because it was a good idea.
