I went to see this movie with me 17 y.o. daughter. I insisted that we do the matinee show, not because I was a sleek, but just feel like I had. In the NASCAR spirit, it's a sponsor's dream. So much blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as an information commercial, if it wasn't for the so-called acting. With the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its cute story lines, the car being just a 'vehicle' (no pun intended) for this movie's cricket ball. Earlier Herbie installments (though cheesy) were produced at more severe times, making them easier to digest. Me. Lohan, Disney's ruling drama queen, has little acting ability. I was surprised that Mr Keaton and Mr Dillon would get involved in such a project. Just the snack bar, was a bigger ripoff!
