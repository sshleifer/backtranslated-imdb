The main character Lance Barton is killed and sent to heaven before his time. When heaven learns from the error, he becomes the body of newly-died rich old and white mr. Wellington given. <br /> <br /> A young black man in an old white male member who is still behaving like a young black man may be funny. if you see it through an old white actor. In this movie I have reminded myself several times: "Chris Rock should be an old white man." <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as intended: The "illusion" is not well transported and the love story is not credible at all. The fact that everything you see is Chris Rock, who plays a young black man, because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small screens, too much for a challenge to the viewers " suspension of unbelief ".
