It is one of the worst movie adaptations of a music ever made. The enhanced version of A Chorus Line is great. This movie misses the mark in virtually every way. Even the casting is astonished. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer, but a 3 in the viewing section. Yes, she finds a solution, but eventually she is a good dancer. What do the brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can't dance and is known to look good. Way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there's the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turns into his grave. Why didn't they use his choreography? It can't really be improved.
