Star count: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a large new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection as opposed to any other. An apostate pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plans to leave the US government to release it. They are therefore obliged to send in their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) In exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his thoughts of all the incriminating information he has learned over the years have to be erased . <br /> <br /> I skipped Attack Force because I could tell about the cover and all the post-production toddler that it was going to be, and then threw all the negative reviews and low user ratings out of it confirm what I think. But I decided to give FOF, because Shadow Man (by the same director) was not bad and what was Seagal's favorite action star once and perhaps, maybe, he could make a good movie again. Oh, what a fool I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, horrible images of airplanes, horrible camera work, cheap production values, recoverable, unconvincing combat scenes that have become Seagal's brand and a boring, sleep-inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I will skip), is apparently the end of his contract with Sony, which no longer means these terrible European lens films and his next film, Prince of Pistols, can be a return to the theaters. Hell, he did it before and Stallone managed to do it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> It's not a Flight of Fury. It's not even fun. It's a flight that doesn't even come off the ground. *
