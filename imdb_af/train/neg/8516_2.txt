Last week I looked at the weekly Nielsen ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, presumably "the best show you don't watch." <br /> <br /> Well, it's right you aren't. watch it. It broadcast twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest rated show on any national broadcast network ... and deserves it. I've been trying to look it up a few times because of all the press coverage that it regards as a "big" show, a "realistic look" on life and so much nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is a drill. It's as unrealistic as it gets, and it deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only secret is why CW was obliged to recall the lowest rated display, after two years of continuing commercial and artistic failure.
