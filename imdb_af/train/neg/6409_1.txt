I saw this movie yesterday. I can't believe the reviews on this site. The one who gives it over one star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a first-order Buffy fan, but I know well when I see it. At each level, this movie is terrible. Technically, much of the time you don't know where you are in this movie, even within one scene, it jumps POV for no reason. No logic whatsoever in movies. Emotionally pale for the dark and trying to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing. Throwing nasty looking redheads in your movie is an inexpensive way to convey 'atmosphere'. I had been patient with that before the last act, but I had too much fun with my friends who did MST3K riffs to shut it down. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful movies, even if 'Scooby Doo' could count on your CV. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) probably can't find a vehicle for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you're having trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few bucks if you promise not to appear in a movie again here! (The estate of Patsy Cline should also beg for slander!)
