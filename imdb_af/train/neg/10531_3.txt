It's a kind of genre thing that also means you from the 1950s musical or you. If you do, you'll love it. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40 musical instruments with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, and so forth, but the 50's songs slow down dance numbers and the soap melodramas of the decade all turned me down. <br /> <br /> This movie is a case-in-point. The first song was good, but the next three did nothing to me. By that time, the story didn't have much appeal either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she loved, including the one where the nice two-footed English teacher she portrays half threatens to leave Siam. (I had it!). <br /> <br /> However, I prefer preferences and dislikes, there is no denial of this Rogers and Hammerstein production, many people call on many people, especially those who decade later by The Sound of Music. . There are similarities in R&H musicals. So, if you like the July Andrews movie, you should also like this. <br /> <br /> This is a Lavisse production, yes, a capital "L." This is the kind of large-scale musical that you rarely saw after that generation. You also get the baptized singers, unlike today, where the actress can't really sing, so Marnie Nixon comes to save Kerr, as she does with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady. "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and is the stereotypical traditionalist, the nice movie makers always look negative. He is not "progressive" as the left wingers say, but the education teacher (Kerr, as "Anna Leonowens") will set him straight. Secular progressives of today always place teachers higher than those trying to cure cancer! However, yul is good at this role and even uses a comedy with its more bass-as-bite character. He's rightly the big star of this movie. Brynner had magnetism. Even in "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the one cowboy to haul the audience. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's a fine movie for his day and millions of people enjoyed it. I will then leave it.
