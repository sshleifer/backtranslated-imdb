I will exclude the usual comparisons of a certain legendary movie maker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona. In view of the comparisons with the hug loser Josh Kornbluth, it is just an insult to any such director. I will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire "Office Space" in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. However, I can compare it to wake up during your own surgery? It is painful to watch and you wonder if the surgeons really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of movie you want them to draw in their early stages of production. It was cruel to make it live, and as a result, audiences around the world are suffering. <br /> <br /> The film's premise ?? if this is one? It is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with heavy commitment phobia, is offered a permanent job. His main duty is to post 17 high priority letters to his boss. But ridiculously, he can't do this simple task. My reaction? Great story! This is not a story? it is at best a passing thought - one that must be passed by a self-respecting film maker. <br /> <br /> The leading actor ?? if you could call it him? is a rogue buffalo of a man, with cub features, a downward, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions ranging from crossing to ordinary disorder. Where o where did the director find this schmuck? What is it that you say ???? he is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment for a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing as one, let alone an actor. Be assured, it is by no means an aimless character murder, but never before have I become such a screen! My frustration was further shamed by his incessant camera monologues between screens. I mean, as if the viewer needed our intelligence to understand this drift, Kornbluth insulted us further by explaining the action (first line of movie filming: "dramatize an exposition, show, tell, tell). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and judgment on his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His decisive agent must be shot dead! <br /> <br /> The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with only one exception. Patricia Scanlon sits in a very funny look like Helen, the former secretary, who was wisely driven by her old boss, making phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face. It made me visit me, but the moment I passed and I was back to watch my watch over the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is also a misunderstanding. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Don't be fooled into thinking this is an art house movie because of the pretentious sound title or the fact that it only played in a handful of theaters and made no money at the box? There is a very good reason for this! <br /> <br />
