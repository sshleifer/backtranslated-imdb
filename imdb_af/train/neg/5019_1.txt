This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If super-fast camera shots get faster than this, we can only pay $ 20 to get into the laundry, get popcorn and watch the dry spin. Jet Li is so much better than that. One can only hope that he will not quickly make any other click movie like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is one movie you should avoid, this is the one.
