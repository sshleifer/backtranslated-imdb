"John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!" I thought when I left the movie's information here on IMDb late on a Saturday night, I looked at the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just recently watched it, and unfortunately it was downhill from there. Probably, you can't spoil a movie of the poor, but I'll leave the fairy tales out of this review ... <br /> <br /> There is a lot of style over very little fabric: unfortunately, the style not dated too well in the eight years since its release. In terms of content, the film tries to look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under the shining veneer, fail to materialize a remotely meaningful or relevant argument. Characters are painted in childlike broad strokes, and fall into the kind of generic stereotypes the author's father tries to question in the Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job of keeping up the pace (maybe it does too much on information context, which will soon become a tiring device but at least pushes the story along), but she efforts Do not detract from the poor writing and the bizarre decision (how to tilt Maddox), when Blake Shields gurns and his way through the part, I just can't understand, and not the many yawning plotgate (I'm all for creative license, but when the "bad guys" know the identity of the "good guys", make their lives miserable, but fail to act to stop them, you really have to wonder why this script has not yet a few redesigned before production - did Dad even read it?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this movie (and all their power), but they're really better off with Hughes Sr. 's high school output, and if the idea of ​​school - time rebellion is what it means you appeals, the 1968 classic "As ..." is a much more satisfying investigation of the subject.
