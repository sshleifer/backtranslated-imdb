This movie is great, you think - just in the way it tells a lot of BAD story. Stella is so terribly rough and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly sneaky and mindful. Never learn better. Is it realistic? Somehow Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her brave ways and dresses, but can't understand that she just has to show it? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman, and a very good mother. Giving herself up so her daughter can be associated with a lot of swollen snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see could have been normal for the times - people who had a beer or two enjoyed a player's piano, dance - but this is a kind of moral inferiority. "I can't live our child this way!" Save me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the Unprocessed Workshop can never hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes. And it's just a load of mushroom washing.
