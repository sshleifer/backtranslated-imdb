I couldn't tell if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a Hitchcock rip or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute. Today someone would have cut it a little and presented it as one of the TV anthology episodes of the old Tales From the Dark Side ... but only after an extensive rewrite. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is, it looks like a nice, nasty little story trying to get rid of this movie and the actors do the best they can with their talent and material with which to work. But the director just didn't know how to raise or fit a dramatic scene; the special effects simply didn't work; the script telegraphed its telegraph plots so clearly that a bivalve man could see them coming; and the soundtrack held the German "oompah band" music while it was supposed to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried very hard. But it's just important as a period piece. I suppose someone who was very young who didn't see much excitement or horror could get a charge of "The Screaming Skull", but someone young would probably not be the most of the subtext or plot motivation. ("Mama, why is that beautiful man trying to scare the cricket cats lady?")
