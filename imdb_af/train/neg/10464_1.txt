This movie is not based on the Bible. It completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the return of Christ. Let alone talk about it. It does not come from the Scriptures. The end-time is called the great tribulation. The movie doesn't even show bad times. The seven bowls, seven vogels and seven trumpets of judgments are cooked to a 15-second sea-tailed newsletter that changes its structure. The anti-Christ was killed 3 1/2 years in the tribulation and that is how the movie ended. The only part they did was there were two prophets. Of course the name did not use, because it would be too close to the truth of Scripture. The worst part was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unsaved people to it. I feel the movie is angry. It's a fake, just like everything the devil does. I just hope it doesn't take away from the upcoming movie based on the back of books. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it was just bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. I saw better episodes of Miami Vice.
