I didn't read a biography of Lincoln, so maybe it was an accurate portrayal ...... <br /> <br /> And maybe that's because I'm accustomed to the equally alienating and unrealistic worship portrayals that are unnatural denies Lincoln as brilliant, honorable and savior of our country ...... <br /> But why would they make a movie representing Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, she portrayed him as a "shucks, I'm just a simple man, a bit offensive. <br /> <br /> [Granted, it was Bushie Jr's whole campaign to let us think he was "just an ordinary man", so we will not mind being a rich and privileged moron - but it's a whole different story.) <br /> <br /> Not only did the movie show Lincoln as kind of a simple (almost simple) kind of guy, the film states that Lincoln has become such a kind of act by accident, and that he is not even interested in the law - Only with the false simplistic idea of ​​the law is about rights and injustice. In the film he is not a very good defense (he is sitting around with his feet on the table and making fun of the witnesses), and the result is mostly determined by coincidence / luck. <br /> <br /> Partly because it was funded by Republicans (in response to some plays sponsored by Democrats coming out) and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie!
