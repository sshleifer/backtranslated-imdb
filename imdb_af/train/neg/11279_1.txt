Words really can't describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least it had some nice shots and the occasional good stripe here and there to stop you from not nodding. It's just laughable! Terrible writing, poor direction, terribly acting and you know what? I can't think of anything else if it's not too long. If you want a 100-minute entertainment, book with the dentist and have some root canal work. Much more enjoyable and much better value for money (if you need it!). By the way, I have to type 10 lines of text to complete this review. - Please do not buy this movie. It's awful!
