It seems to me that some of the films that were banned from film history were actually very important and very good movies. I would like to argue that instead of banning challenging, controversial movies, the sensors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your common sense. If they did, one of the first movies that would be quickly hidden would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace". This movie is horrible with a capital 'A'. This is the worst movie that Burt Reynolds ever had. It's a good thing for a man with 'Cannonball Run II', 'Cop And A Half' and 'Rent-A-Cop' on his CV! <br /> <br /> The waffle-thin story introduces us to a successful herdsman, Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and quick women. He is stuck in a humiliating contract with cricket promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to do a humiliating promotion for a new chain of fast-food restaurants, such as dressing up as a giant chicken. In the mix, Air (Jim Nabors), Ace's dull chicks and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a brain smaller than a pea, which Ace is trying to buy, are bought. <br /> <br /> Hal Needham, the director of this low grade garbage, was previously a stuntman and he has made numerous films that relied on his expertise in the appearance of spectacular stunts and car hunts. Some of these movies were OK, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he reached a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that you really feel sorry for the actors they play. Anderson is anointed with such a stupid role that it makes your teeth despair. The humor is poor and childless, and the stunts and races are imperceptible. Even the issues during the closing credits (which can be found in all Reynolds-Needham collaborations) are generally unsuitable, giving the impression that the movie might not be much fun. "Stroker Ace" is a stinker of considerable size.
