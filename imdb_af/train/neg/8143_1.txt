I had the clear dissatisfaction to see this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I have been attending this festival for over 5 years, and I have sometimes seen bad movies. But 'First Bite' has reached a brand new layer in film. Despite being shot in beautiful places, with occasional, beautiful alternation of fabulous food, the overall number of plot twists and stilted characters is ignored until I almost beg. <br /> <br /> Chief actor David La Haye did not show any character development by the film. He depicted a pompous chef from start to finish. Additional sub-graphs, such as eating disorders, have been so poorly developed and could not fully fit in any context that the movie has shown up to that point. <br /> <br /> A theme of mystique as a poor effort uses a movie that doesn't reach anything, hides, goes nowhere and totally disappoints.
