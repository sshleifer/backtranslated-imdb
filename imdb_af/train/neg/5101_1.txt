The one thing that occurred to me after seeing this float was that I would never have the time to see it again. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael Dorn try and earn what should have been, the installments stay on a holiday home. Woodworking, poor special effects, the only comic highlight was while our alien hero was in female form and it was over as soon as she did her mandatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 minutes. The opportunity to make a decent movie disappeared the moment Nicole Eggbert clocked the stranger into a bar within 30 seconds, while police, military and Joe public didn't pull cotton on it, the woman who had coffee drink, do not use The cup handles and carries four jumpers simultaneously. She must of course come from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was on.
