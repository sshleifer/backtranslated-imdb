Author / Director Peter Greenaway cement his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest practice in unbeatable self-esteem, 8½ Women. The film follows a rich English man and his son on their mutual search for sexual gratification, as they attract and extort women (guess how many) they join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of any possible way this point of departure might be offensive, and Greenaway is likely to have done so. The female characters are a little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists to participate. There is the Kabuki obsession Mio, the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who have a thing for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and does not use a wheelchair, she is the "half-woman", does it? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if not, then what is it? <br /> <br /> The movie is all about anything that has to do with Japan, and a continuation of themes from its snork-worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8½ women are just horny and exploitative. Greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person likely to see it is the author himself.
