East Palace, West Palace reminds me of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the policeman, and William Windom is the boy. It is a progressive film for China, but it also claims myths about the femininity of gay men. A lot of Chinese myths are made in which men engage in female roles. The film focuses on a beloved man who is urgently dominated and hurt by a macho man. He crosses the park without fear - he hopes to be taken by the officer in the station wagon. And this actually happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to a gentle torture: made to scratch for a period, handcuffed, clapped. That's what the gay man wants, and implicitly, the gay man is the head's self-esteem as a male man. The story is about the gay man's life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerant, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a pity for China's gays, which only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't be related.
