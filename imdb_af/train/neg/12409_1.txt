And it comes from someone who can withstand almost any look. The acting and the sound are terrible. It might qualify for a "so bad it's good" point of earnings ,,, for some. But I take my horror movies seriously and it's just crap - it's just as cheap, I think it's my biggest complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times "you have used my fright". The "child" actress is seriously god terribly-I pray her acting career has ended here. However, the line "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS" is repeatedly to watch.
