A great disappointment from author Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on the first season's "Homecoming" was twisted and dark hilarious in every way. This poor handling of an intriguing point of departure disturbed me. The supposed "payoff" showing generic strangers exploiting something from the brain of the infected psychopaths was totally unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the human contamination, why did they do so in such a free sadistic and misogynistic way? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of having the female population butcher the women? I was hoping that the episode would improve if I kept watching, but it just became more pretentious and deadly. The religious subtext simply forced, but it was clear. Sam Hamm had thought it was deep through the weight he gave it. I really like Dante and Hamm's work, but it was just unshakable.
