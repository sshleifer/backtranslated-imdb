Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn't save this movie from an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic Phil Silvers television series, it bombarded because: A) It has been updated until the 1990s, and B). The simple representation of the TV series has turned into a confusing, weak and stupid script. <br /> <br /> The original TV series uses a small group of talented actors to portray lovely characters that make up simple but hilarious pranks. To extend this premise into a 1990s, the demand for trouble was, and it shows. No one can pay me enough to put this stinker a second time.
