This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√© and the way they talk about RPG gamers is also not funny. The problem is that the authors don't want to know how an RPG game works and most importantly how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are a lot of losers who play RPG such as freaking retards and total losers. But for me it's not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story doesn't make sense at all. Who cares about how long a game is played? The biggest problem in this movie is that the authors and actors don't even try to know what RPG is about to make jokes. I felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.
