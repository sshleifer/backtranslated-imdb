I have given these 4 stars because it contains many interesting themes already mentioned here. Of domestic violence, sexuality and many of the taboos in it. Outside the gore I would not mention this horror as much as I would like science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's dark, depressed and hopeless. While I don't mind, I'm very tired of the humans suck cliches that are central to every movie. I know that today you cannot get a liberal art degree without leading the change of self-hatred as a member of mankind, but how does writer / director pretend we are different from everyone in the pack and watch that the ALIEN killing the human race is evil! At the moment, when you read it and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'until your arms are tired. In this way, you won't be around to direct the next movie or write the next book I've told, I deserve to die to be alive. It's stupid, not considerate, and boring.
