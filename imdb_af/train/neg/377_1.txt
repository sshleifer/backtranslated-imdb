Don't even ask me why I watched it! The only excuse I could get was that I was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that is not the Bronchitis. The play is deplorable, Richard Grieco puts it on as a trigger-happy, gun-wrenching series of kills with a love of beating the police. Nick Mancuso plays in a performance as police on his route and Nancy Allen runs the only sympathetic role in the whole movie. The script is spicy, clipped with clich√©d lines, "Are you right, Pardner?" Pick Richard Grieco to each of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
