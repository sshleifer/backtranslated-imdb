This (extremely) low-budget movie is compared to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" as it is labeled as a Slasher Flick. First, let me say that even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (one is filled with original flashes for more than half the movie). "Christmas Evil" tries to become psychologically by introducing the main character as someone who is insane, (a strong word), slow (very slow). He is irritated by people who don't get the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can't stand how the manufactured toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Dressed as Christmas, he eventually goes on a deadly spree. Also a strong word as only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no excitement, no gore, no throw. For one exception, this is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is known to play Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "The Green Mile". He still has to take on the role of himself forever. He is really the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the lead. (which is not so bad, but if you are overshadowed by a little supportive character, you are also not nice.). And what about that strange end? (You have to see it, to believe it). "Christmas Evil" is sowing straight, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. It's not a slasher. You want to see a real Santa, watch the very best time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
