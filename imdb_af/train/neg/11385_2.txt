Before I start, let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing, which I collected from other comments, was the original that some are considered inferior. So it is quite possible that subtitles or the seemingly new DVD version will make a difference. Neither did I read the corresponding book; I am only familiar with another Japanese manga and may lack a cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potential minor spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I usually like scientific fiction stories (like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. As it started slightly intriguing, it became boring when it was just half finished. There are all kinds of problems; Let's start with what is probably the worst: the dialogue. The characters do not seem to be able to formulate full sentences; If they did not shout each other's names for the n-time, they are usually a monopoly (Kanedaaa !, "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most characters completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It doesn't help at least that many of them just get a few minutes of screen time, without anything interesting to say they will get rid of the stereotypes presented by the visuals. <br /> <br /> The grunting is enhanced by some random pseudo-philosophical techobabble that even blurred and uninspired by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it looks random, randomly from different pieces of stock of sci-fi ideas that aren't coherent. <br /> <br /> What is less of an understandable plot is It's not just an excuse to start the overflowing final series, which consists of increasing screens of chaos and destruction. Not that something is wrong with a nice piece of chaos and destruction; But in this case, you find yourself asking, "What is the point of everything and how long it lasts?" Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of a little more than Tetsuo transforms into Pizza the Hutt for no obvious reason. <br /> <br /> The end looks like the one in 2001 - a bizarre series of images that far from anything to explain or explain, let the viewer feel that he only looks at a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will claim this kind of art is; but for me it was just a very imaginative use of color and shapes. (Some of the music was also very interesting). Unfortunately, it's all style and not dust. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies that are intelligent with "adult" themes? I'm sad to say you're more likely to find that kind of thing in "South Park".
