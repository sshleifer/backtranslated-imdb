I can't decide if this movie is so bad, it's good, or to quote Enid Coleslaw, "it's so bad and good again." It doesn't matter, it forced me to look like a heap of strange colored vomit, and it offers a number of scenes that you won't forget even if you want. There is a sniffing young Ray Liotta who tells a spicy Pia that her creative writing looks like a penis. A little later, Ray again, Pia molested, not with the appropriately shaped trophy, but a garden hose. There is a hearty Chinned Pia telling her dominant mother that she is going to sleep with Ray's father, Walter. There is the actress in the graveyard scene who is the best line that Pia or anyone else wrote: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" There is again the garden hose, as Walter puts it Pia's face and roaring waves "Is it more to your taste!?" There is Pia and her date is so touched by each other's mastic salad that they start tearing each other's clothes. There was Pia collapsing, but forgot to remove her dress. Perhaps the best of all, there is Pia's typewriter, but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who made her the most plague (then I was scared to open my laptop). And lastly, there is Pia at The Awards that exposes Hollywood to the cesspool he has spoken the second best ever. "I think I'm not the only one to ever get the way to the top." I see I've been spending more time on "The Lonely Lady" than I have on much better pictures, so I'll stop. However, be warned that once you start to look, you may not be able to take your eyes off the screen before two hours of your life have disappeared forever.
