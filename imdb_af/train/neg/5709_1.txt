Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh excuse me ... treasure "protector" whatever that means) descended from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors was given a clue to the valuation of a great treasure that our founding fathers, mostly not all Freemasons, decided to hide, because they just didn't want to afford their independence so much. <br /> <br /> The first idea seems to be in a long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigli") and some faceless mangoes, enter the container of the ship. They immediately spray tons of powder over the floor, not that it is significant in any way. Eventually they find the clue (a skeleton hangs over it) and it seems to be a pipe at the time of writing. Sort of. Don't explain me. <br /> <br /> This is a mystery, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly aimed at not finding the true treasure, Gates walks to pity on the meaning of the mystery, In this frozen container, while the crew is just about a slack-jawed. I mean, come on. Someone had to have a little voice in their disappointment to come completely to the torrential Arctic area and find nothing interesting, but they just stood there as Gates entered his own world, solving the riddle. <br /> <br /> The following clue appears on the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates are terrified. Several characters provide a very obvious explanation (get used to it). All this leads to Ian's explosion on Gates, and the gunpowder disappears into a big explosion. Ian and his henchmen make their escape, and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk nine miles in sub-temperatures to an Inuit town to stop them. <br /> <To stop them, Gates quit after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Gates and Riley should steal it themselves. Riley then tells Gates in turbulent detail why they can't steal the Declaration because it is so protected by metal and laser eyes and high-tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley there is an opportunity to steal it from the Conservancy. Does Riley know the Conservancy, Gates asks? A place where they make jams and jellies? ' I'm not joking; this is the real line. Bartha doesn't deliver it like a joke. So Riley does all this research on the Library of Congress and the Archives and Water and Sewerage, fercryinoutloud, but doesn't know what the Conservation Room is. It pretty much indicates the level at which this script is. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this short, Gates really makes the D of I, in a ridiculous hacking that can just happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they portray computer monitor technology in movies - full of unlikely and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase ends up for convenience, and as a clear "love interest" angle. At one stage, the three of them really discussed all their plans really hard in a clothing store surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates's father, played by a bad Jon Voight, lead good guys and bad guys to a great Indiana Jones home in New York. Strange that the metro builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior leads Ian on a wild goose hunt. Ian believes they are trapped in a death run and leave them there. But after they left, Riley asked how they were going. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... o boy ... <br /> <br /> ... push a button and open a door. No, I'm serious. A button, as they may have on a flush toilet in an office building. Good thing he knew where it was. Anyway, after a few more buttons, they find this terrific treasure trove (remember, it's all under Manhattan!) Full of all kinds of historical golden things. Riley gets a very stupid game. Again. And the FBI officer, Harvey Keitel, forgives them, arrests Sean Bean and leaves the two chemistry-less to marry. <br /> <br /> For any viewer, I think it will be difficult to ignore all the exposition, the leaps of logic, and the stereotype characters for a long time. Although some of his outlines involve proper history lessons, they are discussed at random moments. I want more conversations like this in my life.
