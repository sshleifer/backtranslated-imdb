A Christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. So of course I was in love when this movie came out in 1994. I opened it and was willing to enjoy myself. I got away and excavated. The expectation set in a Christmas story is curious about this mess missing. A Red Ryder BB Gun is better to get than a Chinese top. And it's not very funny. Charles Grodin is good, but the buck stops there. Bottom Line: 1 Star. Don't even bother.
