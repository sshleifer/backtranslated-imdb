Read my review of the house that has scorched, many can assume I'm about 14 years old who thinks SCREAM is considered "classic" horror. This is not the case because I am 30 years old and watched horror movies for most of my life. But I am a child of the 80's who is on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. Grown up ... kinds of horror movies - so I usually prefer horror movies that are more graphical and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, paintings, or in this case, movie - but not necessarily like them - I appreciate why some of these movies might enjoy ... I just don't ... <br / > <br /> THE HOUSE DESCRIBED is a very boring and boring movie about a school for brave girls. The heavy-hearted mistress of the school ruled with an iron hand (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young boy crawling around the girls as they shower (no less in their pajamas?) And in the meantime girls from the school disappear because they are the victims of a murderer who is lurk over the campus ... > <br /> I can see why the house being scorched is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which I think is a masterpiece of a movie ...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so boring and insignificant that I could hardly stay awake. I'm all for "tension" and "tension" in horror movies - but this movie doesn't like me. Fortunately, I didn't expect much to go into this one, so I can't say I was really disappointed. THE HOUSE WHO WAS WRITTEN, just reinforced that I didn't get most horror movies much older than the 70's. It's not a hard and fast rule, but those I enjoy definitely look more like the exception. Probably a "must-see" for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror movies - but as I don't know too many fans of that kind of material, I can't really recommend this one.
