** HERE IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Review: Mia (Helin) returns from capital Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her father's 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla has separated and moved a village. Mia is still single and is focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility between the sisters and conflicts arise everywhere they confront each other and each one has personal problems that are difficult to handle. As the party (and alcohol consumption) goes on, more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comment: Being the work of a new writer / director was It is disappointing to see this movie in exactly the same tracks that older Swedish comedy / dramas have been following for years. There really are no new elements or ideas. This movie features three basic areas. 1) Humiliating humor based only on characters who make a fool themselves. 2) Sadness and 3) Anxiety. This move focuses on the last one, almost forgetting the first point if the movie goes along. No loss, as the humor there is is not funny. The performances of the film are good, I think, even though it is lost behind all the anxiety and soon forgotten. I was hoping there would be new ideas and influences, but there was none. To quit, there are better ways to spend your time than to watch it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
