This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to look after them well. It is usually educational, funny and clear. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No, the Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they are not trying to learn anything. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops rather say something that is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Is it clear? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color is concerned, everything is extremely bright, so it's good. But Nothing is ever wrong in the Doodlebop world. That's why they're always happy. a child in trouble will become depressed because they are never exposed to sadness. <br /> <br /> The performance is also extremely cheesy. Each syllable is said to be the highest level of exaggeration and lots of wheat. This is too much. <br /> <br /> For children it is entertaining, but beyond the age of 2 you will not want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow up.
