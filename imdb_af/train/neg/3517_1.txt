I don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment I was irritated. Of all the possible decisions they can make in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do the criminals dumb, even though they managed to get a large amount of money from a bank and get away with it? Why doesn't the chief criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? And there are more instances of illogical behavior. I will give this movie 5 points for good action and wonderful scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give this movie 1 point ...
