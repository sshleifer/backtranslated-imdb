The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "review" of a great play and worthy 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone to see it, I'll do a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is loaded with talent, and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OK, an ugly, sterile, one note set. He continues to make the film of every art, distracting, self-centered angle possible. We see reflections of the stainless steel actors, on security monitors, shots of their 200 foot heads above, near eyes of eyes, features and on and on. The screenplay, by a Nobel laureate, suggests long pieces of unpleasant homosexual banter, which is decayed by both parties .... I think ?? Given the character "turns" how will I know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are harsh and impersonal. The running time has been cut by an hour, which is the real problem or the favorite thing the Director did for us. The actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely credible. Jude Law is more than Caine's, but as the credited producer, Branagh's blessing had to be. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have found it disgusting to look at, unconvincingly a former classic. Why was it even made ??? The paying public spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A nice piece of work that fails every turn.
