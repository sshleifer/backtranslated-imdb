I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. Suppose it will be more accurately portrayed as the movie, The Christmas Box, based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I have sent many emails to friends and family to ask them to watch this show, hoping they will better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After watching this movie, I was so disappointed. If a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and really knew the pain, I was hoping that this movie would shed some light on parents who "think" they understand the grief that a parent goes through who child lost. This movie was a very light movie and the folly of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face of parents who buried a child. It was very unrealistic from start to finish. I had a few calls to the movie, each one the same: "It was so far from the point and it looked like it was back on the road within a short while and listening to songs on the radio and life is back of the bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child, as it would never have made the film so far from the point.
