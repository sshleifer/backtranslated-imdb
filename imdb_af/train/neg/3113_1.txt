This movie is a mess. I'm surprised it even released a theater. From Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video. It is poorly written. It is poorly targeted. It's a worse offense is that it has taken an interesting subject and has reduced it to a ridiculous and thrilling thriller that has no excitement and no tension and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the movie goes into a series of ridiculous pieces. It is so high that the audience I saw laughed there. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it is not stressful and there is no excitement - in fact, the movie's really worst offense is that it is just boring.
