What are people talking about here? I had to watch another movie than you did. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. How about these things. I just laughed once and not even so hard. Anyone who relieves this movie should be taken out of the street and beaten. I usually find something I want in a movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" make "Not another teen film" like a classic. It has such a trash as Body Shots, Con Air and Conspiracy Theory as one of the worst of all time. Avoid at all costs! I thought the studio would hand out money to people because they left the theater as a sign of their excuses, but to my dismay it didn't happen. It seems I will never see the money or the two hours again.
