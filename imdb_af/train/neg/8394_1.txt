This is apparently a Z-degree DTV horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have many times" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br / > "Why are you reading that book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting," <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You have come your way here, now you can get your way out again!" (after he led a man in the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they are singing) <br /> <br /> - it's not as clear what this movie is like in the era Not known for post-structuralism, is actually about, or its just bad movie-making. The play is horrible, but some actors I know are hammering it too? <br /> <br /> An old house, naturally cut with a contemporary home, is the place of murder. A (bad) movie is made in the grounds and the story repeated again.
