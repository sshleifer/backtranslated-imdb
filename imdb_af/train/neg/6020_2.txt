I like end-of-day movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I would like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the bad effects, the often horrible music, the circle-inducing lines. I can ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie is constantly relying on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject. I can ignore the fact that the people who are starving and trying to reach world peace are the bad guys. Neither of these things kills the movie. What kills this movie is that it's just plain and boring. Nothing really happens; Almost all the scenes in the movie are designed to push the filmmakers' morals on viewers, at the expense of actually a coherent story, or any kind of tension. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining B movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
