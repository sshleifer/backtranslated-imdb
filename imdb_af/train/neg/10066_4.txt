I recently watched it and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I get the feeling they are the same movie, but I want to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no pikachu is all I can come up with. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was rather boring. She sounded as if she had almost fallen asleep, not at all an expression with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> It was nice enough, but there wasn't much at all. <br /> <br /> A collector (who goes to Lugia, he has no plan to destroy the world) and the common characters trying to stop him from trying to catch Lugia, cause a lot of destruction. <br /> <br /> The pokemon movies that follow are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) are good, with no. 8 almost here.
