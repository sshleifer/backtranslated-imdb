I can't stand this show! Was there ever a quality, a funny punch line or a plot line that didn't "want the average viewer to drown himself in a bowl of soggy wheat flakes? <br /> <br /> The voices, oh, that terrible, miserable It is possible to drag a set of fine cutlery over a dusty blackboard each time, each character being particularly annoying in his or her ability for shrill, nasal chorus. stereotypical screw, and Timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad version of a game program host (Guy Smiley of "Sesame Street" occurs). <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible, even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" Laughs at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show, each character throwing teeth, or a square head, or a head three sizes too large for his or her body. characters who speak wide-eyed and grinning every line, as if they were setting up a photo with the president? r the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic. Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck of Charles in Charge, characters are portrayed as so unrealistic stupid. Usually, "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unfunny", and that is certainly the case here. There was not so much slapstick as "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good. <br /> <br /> Finally, showcasing the show (and this is the same every single episode, such a great time warrior warning here): Timmy wants something with his "Quite Oddparents", something goes wrong, is always quite a reason why he cannot return immediately and wants to take away the damage, and then everything is fine. Oh, and Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they stay with her every time. Maybe it's just me, but it looks like a children's show that contains the subtle message, which does it very well, is not likely to tell an abusive babysitter, is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing a paper and want to give an example of how far the quality of cartoons has fallen, "The Fairly Odd Parents" should be a good place to start. An excellent example of television producers bringing a worthless product aimed at children with little or no effort, because they know someone will see it somewhere.
