Predictably, telling a thousand times the ordinary drama in between, some beautiful, racial sex scenes mixed with some character paranoia, 70-year-old style casual violin horn music that is sometimes comical, I can't help. /> <br /> I usually like Defoe, and it should be said that the acting is not so bad, the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and keeps you guessing from time to time. It's just that it's too predictable, I felt like I was making a TV drama instead of a new movie. Perhaps this is the style the directors wanted, but it should be said that the review I read here before I saw the movie could only be written by someone involved in the production. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much, and if I could blow the clock back, I wouldn't have seen it at the cinema. I'll wait for the bargain boxes at your video store, I'm sure it won't take long.
