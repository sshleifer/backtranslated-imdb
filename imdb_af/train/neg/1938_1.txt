Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30. <br /> <br /> Amitabh is 33+ years in prison ... he <br /> <br / > A) Telepathic sperm house sent? <br /> <br /> B) Have a beautiful Pakistani guard asked to post it to him? <br /> <br /> C) They allow for marriage visits in secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All of the above <br /> <br /> E) The producers have a bit to do much bhang at <br /> <br /> the time they approved the script <br /> <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - he is yum, yum, nice ... and apparently he wants her - who doesn't want it right ?! ... But if her father gets out and then killed (I hardly think it's a spoiler, because you have to be brain-dead and blind to not see this coming in the movie). He is fairly emotional about this disaster and with the point (metaphorically) of his hat, leaving behind to save his father, no matter what her loss is, and say (paraphrase) "If God wants it, we will meet "... Basically," I'm going to get my dad and d done my work, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- Callus passes even low-life Hollywood standards ... <br /> < br /> # 3 There are so many holes in this terrible waste of time, called a movie, that you can manage all the jeeps, truck camels and any extra stuff through it. Pass - really, complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a big dance series (yes, just one - like in dance order - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but NOT worth it. just look for it. <br /> <br /> Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take theater lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty damn good - 7.5 / 8 I want to say!
