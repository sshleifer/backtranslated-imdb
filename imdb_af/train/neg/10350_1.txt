We all know that some of the best movies of all time were based on books. Although it wasn't particularly accurate adjustments, these movies were great movies. Some good examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney movie ever made. However, I am sorry that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it meet some of Madeleine L'Engle's fan base's most basic expectations. It manages the standards of writing, acting, special effects and ultimately respect for the audience. Note, I'm not trying to make sense; On the contrary, I went into this relationship with an open mind. I thought a made-for-T.V. would make film for his lack of razzle blind in his writing. After all, the Star Wars variety Ewoks was decent, a bit stupid. Think about it, the original Star Wars was made at a lunch budget and watched it take George Lucas! But from the first scene, disappointment had begun to surround me as if I was too close to the Black Thing while I was getting tasting. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Greedo shootings became the first symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental relationships where a disgruntled director experienced several terrible changes to a beloved classic it, Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol of the confusion and stupidity that is a ripple in time. The reason for this is the fact that she was mutated outside of faith. Aside from the slightly controversial decision to decide Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-worn mentor, the filmmakers have decided to introduce her as a crow. That's right, a crow. In addition, the heavenly central form of this much-loved character is hacked by which seems to be a demented eight-year-old; The majestic half-man, half-horse with wings, has become a great human head, with a creepy smile that is uncomfortably mounted on the front panel of a horse carrying some wings in the middle. If I were five, it would have traumatized me for life. The worst is that when it is spoken, it is pointed out behind the responsibility to drop, leading to a scene spent at the back of his head, and to see a single shaky cheek. the piece of special effects less credible than ET <br /> <br /> After getting rid of the painful part, I must continue with the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting and the story. Personally, I always thought to Meg that it looked similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter movies: ordinary hair, glasses and a figure that would find most supermodels are ridiculous. She was always a little anxious, humorous-pessimistic math genius, who simply couldn't care less about the import and export of Nicaragua. In the film she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy at all. In fact, I'm sorry for poor man. Jenkins, her principal, has to deal with her all the time. Calvin, the kind, intelligent child that everyone thinks is a jock, has become a jock! The irony is terrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman who had looked at happy things and replaced her with a "top-of-the-generation" and likes to look "funny" things like girls who out of swing fall. The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit and the man with red eyes (the name "the dude with red eyes" because of his complete revival as a character). <br /> The story is a mess. A good comparison with this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and Azkaban's prisoner, who did not do a good job of telling the story in the book, but kept the only one of the original work. Here, the book's ankle played a pleasant conversation with Hades in the underworld, apparently unaware that his body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord replenishes how well it has shown the truth to be seen and not seen, the spine of Ixchel (which replaces the wonderful creatures replacing Tant Beast among their ranks) is sprouting. As the God of the Dead observes how subtly the terror of Earthy Camazotz was, the torn pages were scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry this movie exists. I don't believe the actors were really bad. This is the way the characters are written that destroys it. A Wrinkle in Time deserves to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, director of George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, strengthened at Industrial Light and Magic, achieved by John Williams, with his sound at Skywalker Sound, published by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox . In its current state, the film is unworthy of showing to self-respecting people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. <br /> <br /> The book was good, the movie was bad and Mrs. Whatsit was ugly. <br /> <br /> Score: 0.1 / 10 (If I could) <br /> <br /> Before: <br /> <br /> They got the names right. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> It had terrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of customization, essay, acting and special effects, not to mention lack of evidence that they ever did not read the book. Oh, and the hat / poster has a picture of the three main characters driving a flying horse over a castle. Some may say it symbolizes a high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother the Photoshop Meg's arm well.
