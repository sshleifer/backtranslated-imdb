*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" released in the US by First National. Karloff is dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his research because she has dried up funds. Karloff is obliged to return to France and start a medical practice. He is suggested by a female woman who wants to get rid of her much older man. She knows that Karloff needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with the proposal and soon becomes the man's personal doctor. All the time the woman is coming over the town with the local, not good playboy. Karloff eventually injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off. But his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and finds out that the will has changed. When he rinses the beans for the woman, she goes berserk and even bites the boy's hand. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse used the hypo Karloff to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out that he doesn't get money, he asks the woman to poison the boy. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. Analysis shows poison, but not quite on time, as Karloff kidnapped the nurse. <br /> <br /> To shorten a long story, escape the nurse, get the police and rescue the boy being invaded. by Karloff. Karloff injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie does have good points. Karloff is owned and plays the kind of doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man who was still alive. However, it's strange to see him walking, tight and slightly overturned. We never know why he is walking this way. I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress playing the 2-timing woman surpasses something terrible. She has a French accent. Although she is poorly persuaded, you can still hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting ...). <br /> <br /> A little below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the sound is a little slack.
