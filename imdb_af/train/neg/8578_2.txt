One of the silliest films of the 1940s, an unbearable haunted comedy with music with Kay Kyser. Kyer, orchestra leader and radio star (and the eternal college fraternity goof-off) were kind of the predecessor of Spike Jones, pitched it to his guests and willingly backed up by his happy group of musicians. He was hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy house, the species where African gypsies were imported, was erected and hung on the wall. The shindig is busy with a foul judge, an evil professor, an ominous swami, many giggly females, and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to break out of, and it is also not convincing that Kyser does it with elbow-in-the-ribbed material that is ten years old. * of ****
