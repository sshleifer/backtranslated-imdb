I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a high-hum event. Wm C Quantrill is barely shown in the film, probably the most impressive figure of the period. Frank James has never been mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who was completely absent in writing every time he slept in battle for his murdered sister. Instead, we were forced to watch fictional characters who never developed into anyone we cared about. how sorry. The costumes, however, were wonderful, just like the place shot in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another movie of the time and try again, or another filmmaker will look at the enormous wealth of material to write a screenplay.
