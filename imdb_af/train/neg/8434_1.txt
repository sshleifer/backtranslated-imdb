This movie shows more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have ever experienced in an American movie. The steroids are so overwhelmed that my ability to continue watching has died. I was so disappointed at Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna called a lot of men, sitting in a Jewish center in New York, cleaning weapons, heroes of common sense, and I stopped. I'm deeply <br /> <br /> disturbed by the notion that Jews are not Americans and "different". I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, not a healer of the same.
