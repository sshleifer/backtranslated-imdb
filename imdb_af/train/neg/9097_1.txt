Who actually created this piece of crap, it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's such a waste of time and money. I hate how they follow a low budget with D-Lister actors and a storyline similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> I got this movie in the bargain next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 which was a fool I actually think it might be good, but I looked at horror as poor acting stereotypes torn from the storyline and writing from the 1st. <br /> <br /> Whoever thought it was straight-to-video production was actually a half-decent movie you should crack or something because I think most of the people who saw this movie think WHAT A LOAD OF CAPS !!!!
