The mummy's grave begins with an overview of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story over a few years and across the sea to the United States where the current high priest and mummy Kharis challenged to destroy and revenge on those who have violated the tomb in the past. <br /> <br /> While I absolutely loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff as Imhotep's mummy, and very much like "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (who is the direct prequel on this movie), I was not so with "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> It's made in a similar style to the previous movie and has a somewhat similar plot, albeit in a new environment. Lon Chaney Jr. is good like Kharis, but doesn't really stand out. And I think it's my main criticism of this movie - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing is really outstanding, so the viewer is having a rather blatant mummy's story.
