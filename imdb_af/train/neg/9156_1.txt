Ben & Arthur CAN write, aim, watch and make this movie a 10. Sam Mraovich. Sam had given his idea to a good writer, director, and conveyed the play to someone who could act. This is a good example of one person who controls the whole production. there was no one to tell him, "Sam, it's bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett's play was the only good point but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). The acting and direction were so bad, this movie was changed into a comedy. you just had to laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point .... it would make a good date movie. after the first two minutes you will stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
