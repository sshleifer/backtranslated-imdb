I don't even know where to start on this one. "It's all about the family." It must be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie, although it may not be a horror movie, even if it has tried! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing the token man who dies in each action film (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man created "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He does have talent. Also, Lily Taylor has to be in indie movies. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones must become a pornstar. There is no place in lawful conduct for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
