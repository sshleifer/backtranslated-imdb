This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the prospect of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally a horse dead in SLOW MOTION. The man who did this spiritually cleansed his conscience through the flames of the burial / burning of the horse, which, of course, is still dead, which was tortured to death. It's one of the sickest, slimmest movies I've ever had the displeasure to watch. Like Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we must admire their minds for finishing the race. I would like to place the producers and director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they've finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
