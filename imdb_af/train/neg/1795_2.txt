I had the opportunity to watch this film as a member of a test, and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the chance to conduct the investigation. I felt the movie's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot. Instead, it was composed of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character developed enough for the audience to form any form of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care about what happens to the characters. In fact, any one chart and the accompanying characters could be completely removed without seriously harming the movie. (The time taken would be allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub-characters and characters.) The Hungry Bachelors Club's plate is crowded with sugars and aperitifs when an entre is won.
