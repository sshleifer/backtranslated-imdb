Cybil Richards leads another Full Moon / Surrender Cinema masterpiece of eroticism. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in the silver outfit rather than picking up) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can't resist watching the ties and she likes them. The sex scene is well filmed and sets an excellent soundtrack (at least for this kind of movie). The roll cage is largely awful and mostly average. Jacqueline Lovell is very attractive to herself and to look at the sex files, she manages to expose her breast and lifts a little. She also fits some lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of journey. Here she looks pretty naked, but actually it is much more attractive in her silver clothes that tell the drama. Full litter movie with Lovell and soundtrack are the only true redeeming features. Moderate even for Surrender's output and clearly a new budget for them.
