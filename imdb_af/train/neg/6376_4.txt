Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house in which she grew up. She recently inherited from her late sister, unknown to her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in it. Jennifer decides to sell it as she needs a lot of money for her grandmother's chagrin. She also begins difficult recurring nightmares from a mysterious raven. There was really no one to relate to in this movie. Jennifer was cold, far, unintentional, and narcissistic, while the grandmother was nice, sad and narcissistic. The movie is good and well made, but with no one to empathize, I found it hard to worry about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My Degree: C-
