Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already setting up a successor to a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and is free around Kabul, working on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission he suddenly picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3,000 meters. He is eventually promoted to sergeant, but cannot decide between a sniper and surgeon career. So he goes completely off the army. One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joined the navy and showed the last scene that he proudly wears a white uniform.
