I watched this show, and I didn't get it at all. It might have been the first episode. Recently, I realize ABC is playing many stupid performances and going down as a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and essay are pretty terrible and will still be accompanied. I would say I believe this show will be canceled, but if ABC is dealing with the quality of the performances they play, they can only keep this one because it is average compared to them.
