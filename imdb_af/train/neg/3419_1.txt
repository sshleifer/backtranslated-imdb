Okay, so, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to get this successor. I have one question - why? Who reads this writing and says, "Sound is great! Originally!" This movie is bloated shit that I will not wither my toilet bowel. Of course this is another story that follows in the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on. Chuck Norris is, of course, the one man who can have the same America from some bad guys. He doesn't need a gun most times. It's stupid patriotic jargon that hides the mind. Big surprise that the only one who is going to direct this Norris movie is Chuck's son Eric. Eric Norris worked mainly on all his father's films and TV shows. Doesn't this strike someone as a sign that he has no talent? Then he leads the same people as before into the same stories as before. The only difference is the characters' names. If it's supposed to make me patriotic and brave for the US, then our country is in much worse shape than I ever thought. Hopefully this will be the nail in Chuck Norris' acting coffin.
