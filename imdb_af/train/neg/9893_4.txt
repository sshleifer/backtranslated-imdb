I just hope that no classics / ancient historians saw "Cleopatra", or if they did, they adopted it as a laugh. The movie is terribly inaccurate, more laughing, even as "Gladiator" (at least it is a well-written script whose historical errors articulate and closely match the story). Most blatant are Octavius, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before Caesar's murder: at the age of 19! <br /> <br /> Besides, the play is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says, "Caesar. Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a funny poet Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela is trying her best to be the seductive pharaoh (who was not good at all in real life), but coming out so incredibly. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning for all historians - this movie is not true!
