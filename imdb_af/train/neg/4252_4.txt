*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I see it today, I had some expectation of how it would be, not too high, but not too low. It was nothing like I had already expected. It seems to me that the filmmakers can't entertain what kind of movie to make. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the movie, it's a little mysterious and a bit exciting, but it will soon change to some ridiculous scenes - many obvious scenes. As I looked further, I almost fell asleep a few times. <br /> <br /> The end is the most ridiculous of all though, almost explosive / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it doesn't have any good scenes, it's just that movie never become "whole". <br /> <br /> Movie-Man
