I went to see this movie with a crowd consisting mainly of "spiritual" New Age types, which is quite different from what I enjoyed much about this movie. Although according to those who knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the film is not quite as good. So, if you tend to think yourself "spiritually", you can tolerate or at least tolerate things like "aura" and "astral body", and don't care about the regular use of the term "energy" outside the context no. of physics or technology, you may like the movie and will probably enjoy even more with which book it appears to be based. <br /> <br /> But if you're mostly in contact with the physical universe, as your ability to suspend unbelief, is easily exhausted by unfinished New Age nonsense and plots based on it. In addition, you have a low tolerance for cheese-like lighting effects to indicate the event of spirituality, and perhaps even reasonable non-wood dialogue expects a play, then it is my recommendation for you about this movie: Stay. Gone. <br /> <br /> Don't think about it first. Tonight, this film has relocated Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie. (I don't count movies I'm going to see expecting them to be bad, like Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, it picked up the grand total of movies I almost walked out on two (D & D is the other one). I'm not going to film, not even on this one, but I need to have seen the visual representation of an aura because the New Age BS stays thicker and thicker. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a group of people connecting themselves to some old prophecies, striving for spiritual enlightenment and aimed at bringing humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. They actually say that these spiritual things are the next step in human evolution, which must make someone even the worst idea of ​​what human evolution is. The movie is shocked with soups. Sometimes people come across what they would describe as a different dimension, or perhaps another airplane, just to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached relief. Goodness. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director commends the audience by dividing the insights that make up the prophecy, painfully slow, presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the theater as better, more enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good stuff about the movie? Some very beautiful scenery, and some decent supporting performances by Elizondo and the Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that it is my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable. This is actually the cheapest spiritualism of the naïve kind, and unless it is your thing, you need to do something different with your time and money.
