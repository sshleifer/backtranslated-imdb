Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat lame movie. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Perhaps I was one to punish me by watching one terrible movie after another. I don't know, I think I needed a hobby during my teens. A teenage publisher (Rainbow Harvest) is looking for comfort in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the terrible power that this ancient mirror has and uses it to strike against those who have wronged her. Movies like this, the power provider has a nasty side effect. This one changes inside and out if she likes or not. <br /> <br /> A junk of a movie that's for some reason, e.g. a few years back. I do not know why. They had to leave it on the shelf and collect dust. People like this movie enemy for some reason. If you do, I'd like to know why. Until then I don't like this movie and I have no reason to ever see it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
