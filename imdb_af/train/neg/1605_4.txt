Recently I saw the documentary: "The revolution will not be broadcast", also known as "Chávez: within the coup". Initially, I thought it showed a real insight into events during the Venezuelan coup in April 2002. However, what bothered me was the fact that the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music was suggestive and that at no stage was any criticism about Hugo Chavez. This is strange, because if a documentary gives a non-biased version of what has happened, it should have been. In fact, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, as the documentary is several years old, there is still much additional information available on the Internet today and it was not difficult to find, for example, "Urgent Chavez Investigation of the 5 European TV Companies Financing the Movie It offers blatant lies about Venezuela. "It contains a list of the many errors and intended or unintended fakes in the documentary document. (Just use the title as a search engine in Google, you'll find it). Another interesting document was the video recording of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary, a ray of lies. To me it seems a good counterweight to Chavez: within the coup. It is available at video.google. I strongly advise you after looking at "Chavez: within the coup" to look at a lie's X-ray and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian (aware or not) were part of Chávez propaganda.
