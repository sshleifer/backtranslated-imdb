The Van is a emotional movie about a man trying to lure girls into his new bus, to deceive them. The only thing this movie does not fail is in the late 70's exactly what the truck in the US portrays. It seems to have been made entirely by amateurs. It's trash, but I loved it! I have to admit I'm a fan of 70's trash! Hope this one makes it to the IMDB bottom 100! <br /> <br /> 2
