Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you bother, and light just falls on the subject. But core accuracy is no compensation for a dishonest, ill-considered and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes ranging from the 'mysterious and noble' American Indians to the 'stuffy but sadistic' British officials. An else and unworthy version of a fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
