At least under those movies with 100 votes or more. Named the best script written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role ?? Named the best photo? I do not even agree with much of the Oscar addition, but this movie may well be the worst film honored by the Academy. The writing and acting were both terrible. Blethyn's perfomance was, in particular, one of the worst things I have ever seen, and probably the most appreciated acting performance of all time. Awful movie, not worth the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel ever played, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful that I didn't actually pay to see one of the most overestimated movies of all time.
