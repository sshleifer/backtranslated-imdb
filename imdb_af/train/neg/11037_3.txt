I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It's wonderful! When Jim throws that little person through the window, the look on his face is invaluable. Then if he first speaks to the priest in his wife to find out she has become the Pee-Woman? Great writing and good casting with great acting make it a must see. I try to find a certain picture of the episode. I want to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman? Can someone point me in the right direction to find such a picture?
