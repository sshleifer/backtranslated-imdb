This movie must be the worst I have ever seen. The title of the movie deceives the audience into thinking there may be hope. The story line of the movie is at best ridiculous, with the acting so poor, you just have to cringe. The title "Zombie Nation" implies a lot of zombies when in reality there are six in total. It cannot be categorized as a horror movie because of the introduction of the music of cheesy 80 as the zombies' attack. The zombies are talking and working like people in the movie. The only difference is the makeup that looks like something from a La Roux video. If you ever get the chance to buy this movie, then do it and then burn the copy.
