I didn't expect much from this movie, but oh brother, what a stinker. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a huge box of $ 5 DVDs at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this disc was, I felt ripped off. The special effects looked at a high school, the camera works by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the 'Christian School'. One can imagine the long and excellent 'prayer meetings' of the production company after the rush back. The people who credited this thing had to have had serious anti-biblical feelings towards the turbulent production company that expressed this thing. Think of their anxiety because they've seen their $ 914.86 investment go up in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad. Perhaps the Xian filmmakers should look at GOOD movies and try out the things they are doing so well. Credible stories and characters, less hysterical arm movement and fanaticism, and a story that appeals to everyone, not just true believers. That is, Stop the sermon, save it for the church. For example, take the Omen or Prophecy series. Excellent movies with compelling story lines, great cinematography and intense music. No hysterical arm movement. No preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a laugh track, it would have been much better.
