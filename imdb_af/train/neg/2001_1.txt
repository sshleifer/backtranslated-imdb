Why were there so many people pushing together with Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" (Contra Todos) at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's about a hit," my friend said. "Well ... and that's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot? Very unconscious. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us one little detail: it's a very bad movie, really pretty awful, and so unpleasant to see if it's made bad. <br /> <br /> How did Todos's contrast make the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many smaller local festivals and now San Francisco? Apparently, due to the way the promotional process and the film festival track work. <br /> <br /> First, it won first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where it is called the best Brazilian movie of the year. It must have been a bad year; they had much, much better. Next, snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to abundant auditoriums and - as the movie does not appear anywhere and therefore the criticism is continually reviewed - it keeps track of. <br /> <br /> Feesblurbs are aimed at Promotional occasions. A Chicago festival called a "Contra Todos", a speed-ball shot straight from Brazil, referring to Claudia's boyfriend as the "paralyze of the slum neighborhood." Soninha is "Teodoro's nude teenage daughter of emerging sexuality." The film is "shot with the urgency of a regular hand camera" and the director "works on a real and tangible sense of frustration arising from household despair and decay." The effect is "unbearably raw and honest", and the movie "comes to a conclusion as shot dead as the life on the screen." Not the best writing, but it certainly boasts the excitement of a certain type of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" refers to a hit, actually two men and a woman and daughter and a born again Christian friend. It's shot - in a clumsy digital video with no talent behind the camera work - mostly in an unpredictable suburban, rather than in one of the fabulous "favelas" or village-bound Brazilian city slums where such wonderful movies like "Black Orpheus", "Pixote" and "City of God" were made, not in Rio this time, but São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The hit with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his drug problem partner is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a small TV experience, as well as the actress who plays Teodoro's finite blonde wife Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço, who plays her excited, daughter-in-law Soninha. These actors can make it through the backs of some telenovela's. Who knows? - In a better-directed movie they can even be good. Apart from them, there are some young men who are bumped by Teordoro or, when busy, gangs of thugs. The principals do not work much, although the camera increases their pores. <br /> <br /> A few observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one at London, have seen this movie's failures, but unfortunately they are being buried in the Web interior. Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the "movie" (his quotes) was the "worst of the video work". "The movie maker chose to have the video selected just because it was a cheap alternative to film," Sheehan wrote, "and made no creative use of the new medium," and he adds nothing else creative. no. /> <br /> Sheehan points to the film's first big mistake: it starts as a domestic drama that is supposed to catch up when half an hour in action, Moreira seems to hit the father and one of his friends professionally is men. Waiting for the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie, it seems to be a completely arbitrary decision and at least a waste of time. But it's quite Moreira, like a little kid who got a tool kit. for his birthday, and go around to make everything in sight without rhythm, reason or skill. "Devastating, but true. <br /> <br /> Writing the 2004 London Festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side, but gave away the lack of redeeming qualities. characteristic." Yes, very easy, since everything else is so bad. Asanjak acknowledged that "this low budget, violent and ugly account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is without any characters and hence of hope. Too dark and cynical to be a narrative version of the human condition, the film is not helped by poor captions. "Asanjak's commitment from Contra Todos to Dogma and Mike Leigh didn't help. <br /> <br /> Apart from that meaningless first half-hour in which nothing waits for our boredom for the first acts of violence - which, when they come, "just stomp everything in the face without the drive, reason or the skill ". Meerira tries to unleash his sudden final by adding what comes out, followed by an incredibly ironic ending scene where one of the characters is married. Undoubtedly, the director wanted to exhibit the "banality of the evil" of low-level married men in work-class weeks, but he could not make the characters he generically see alive to us. And the structure of the film shows that he can't change his material either. <br /> <br /> (See at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005.)
