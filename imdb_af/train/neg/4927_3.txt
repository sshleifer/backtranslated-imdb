Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary via the theater, has written, directed and produced other films on controversial topics, but it can be the first to see widely, thanks to TCM. This film is her accusation of abortion, but she cripples the problem smartly by introducing eugenics and birth control, and leaves the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and other film skills is well displayed here, but one can be forgiven for using less didactics. If you wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr's "famous dad" looked like, here's your chance. 1916 modes and cars are also on display to add to the importance of this museum piece. It's nice even if you don't appreciate the propaganda.
