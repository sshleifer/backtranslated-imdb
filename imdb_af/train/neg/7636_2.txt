I really wanted to believe in this movie because the only form of mainstream comedy that this country recognizes is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it got totally different - let's get cool and edgy - and come out with little to show. I bet a small seed went straight for it. I know SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have the comic tiles to pull them off. Even Danny K had better timing. I'm really serious. Each time they suggested a little character, I thought, "Darn, this person had to be the lead!". Independently does not mean that the camera work should be terrible. Black and white did nothing for this movie - in fact, such a flat dialogue made it even more painful by bringing the boredom into sharp relief. The black and white were also not sharp. The composition was terrible. The use of music was terrible. Strangely enough, I watched the movie Little Miss Sunshine and the composition of it was wonderful. Perhaps the shortcomings in this movie are in my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was worse than the leaders before he said anything) spoke to this movie and not David - see it and you will understand. I bet the guys who are organizing Oppikoppi were ashamed. One would think that nothing would happen. I felt it could be filmed in someone's backyard. I know regular guys who have much harder, noisy and whiter conversations than any of these "comics". The guy who encouraged them in the end was OK. <br /> <br /> Guess SA comedy will stay a little longer in the stone age. Nice work guys.
