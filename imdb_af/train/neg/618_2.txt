Maybe it's one of the worst teenage cat movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad points of the movie, which covers the whole movie pretty much. First, nobody can avoid: DIFFERENT. I swear they picked up some random children out of the street, based on how they looked. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You hardly know half of the children killed here. All you figure is that they have somehow earned it. The scarecrow's character was redundant, and a cheap frost-off of the other great fantasy killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The scarecrow was full of horrible one-liners that made you laugh just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find some little animals to torture!" really just leave you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: BAD CASTING. How old was the man who played Lester? Like 30? The back of his head was for God's sake. There is much more that I can say about this movie, as it is cheap special effects, it is a "high school movie class" effort, but the point is understood. It's just bad movie show at the worst. What made me "good" in the movie: -View for those with low, low, low standards - can help sleepless. A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.
