Dynasty Review in Hawaii ... Full of clich√©s, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do it, it offers 40 minutes of simple, unforgettable entertainment, endless watching of great male and female muscles and great photography of the spectacular Hawaii scenery. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more than that, stay away ... Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or knowing something to run one, you have two options: 1. You will feel sick every two minutes with the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show offers Hotel Business, or 2. Watch it as science fiction comedy as I did, lie back, relax and laugh at It!
