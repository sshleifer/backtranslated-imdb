If you like watching Mel Gibson at Million Dollar Hotel, you can enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another movie, so bad it can never be distributed. I can only testify to the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is of better quality, but the movie night and dark scenes are so poorly done that everything looks red. For the first time I thought my DVD players were messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it, I advise you to adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you don't, you'll never be able to get through the movie. Doing so will only remind you of a poor film student trying to relive the style of pulp fiction.
