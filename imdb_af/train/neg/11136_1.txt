It's just the second time I've felt enough to comment on imdb about a movie. The first time was probably the best movie I've ever seen and that was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Seeing Darkwolf is on the other side of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I have had the accident to watch. Apart from the two scenes that contain nude women, there is nothing in this movie to take it out of the trash. <br /> <br /> Let's see, apostate effects, cleft writing, bad acting and about 90 minutes long. My wife and I laughed at the worst in disbelief. Unbelievably, I watched it to the end, how I did it, I don't know! AVOID !!!
