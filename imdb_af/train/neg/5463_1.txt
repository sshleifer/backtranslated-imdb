I've seen Arthur (the TV series and the books) years ago and never loved the show very much (if you're a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I spoil it for you, but it's actually what I think ). Many people liked it, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> The school characters fought all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were very nice to each other, but gradually I got tired of Arthur's clapping attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (but the name was spelled), and DW was an Arthur's ADHD (or ADD) -like 4-year-old sister who sometimes claims (what could Arthur argue with what her routines were, such as her imaginative girlfriend and her stuffed animal collection, etc.) , Arthur's friends acted as teenagers, instead of what they were in the Arthurian books, and the parents didn't care much either. <br /> <br /> The biggest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
