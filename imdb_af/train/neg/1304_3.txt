Very low-budget police procedure movie about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body appears in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only idea is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, it has the appearance of an independent production recorded by the studio for distribution. The role-players, with a few exceptions - including a young and unreasonable Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - consist of complete unknowns and show them. The performances are universally sub-par and will not be passed in a high school picture. The direction is blunt and hooked and, as mentioned before, there is no chemistry between the main players. However, despite the many shortcomings of the movie, it has some good points. The location shot in New York City and the film's ultra-low budget, give it an eager authenticity, like that of the far superior "The Naked City", a shooting in a dark basement is properly handled and some of the investigation procedures are clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write about the house. In the early 1950s, however, it was worth a look in the early 1950s of New York City. Old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of the 30's and 40's in the streets. <Br /> <br />.
