The film was made in 1942 and with World War II the film industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were all around. <br /> <br /> The movie is great to watch because of the fantastic dance of Eleanor Powell. Last Miss. Powell was definitely a good hit in every sense of the word. She is back with a very young Red Skelton here. The two of them also died in "I Kill It." <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who was 3 years later, was excellent because Mildred Pierce's investigating officer reappeared as Powell's request to deliver. N item. Trouble is that Olsen and his villains are actually Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self and he gets great support from Virginia O'Brien.
