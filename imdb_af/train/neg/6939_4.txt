R Balki tries to tell you a story that was told in a sensual way by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd. This time it is mixed with adult humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and owns an Indian Cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his work just like any other work. According to him, cooking is an art. He still can't make Hyderabadi Biryani properly. <br /> <br /> Tap Tabu that sends her the correct Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon meet and eventually fall in love with each other? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ??. No probs! But a Hitch! Tabu's dad, Paresh Rawal !! The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger for him. And the complications begin? Performance shows are all three actors brilliant. The film's script is very strict and interesting. The dialogues of the film are striking. But somewhere you feel your stomach is not properly filled. The comedy is sometimes not properly understood. The film also tries to go some parts long. <br /> <br /> No more music to sing except the Title Track. The camera work is good. Director R Balki could have done much better from this writing. But in the second half, he looks confused himself. The father's Satyagrah scene looks annoying. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan at the scene are pathetic. <br /> <br /> In general, Cheeni Kum had to have more sugar!
