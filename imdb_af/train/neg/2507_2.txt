It's not a good movie. It's irreconcilable, all the acting is bad, and has done a cripple story you've seen a thousand times much better. Not to mention, you can see every plot point coming from a mile away. Worst of all, nobody bothered to tell Lonette Mckee that she couldn't sing. But who cares, she is so good, beautiful. But I deviate, nothing new here. Bottom line, a hot girl group benefits, some get addicted to drugs, someone gets stuck to a guy, someone gets out of hell and then the terrible things happen. Surprised, surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can't believe so many people out there that it's a good movie. So many of you would like to use a sliding scale when it comes to rating Black Movies. I don't play it! If you want to support these movies by seeing them - great! If you enjoyed it - super! To each one his own. But try not to say it was good. Pleeeease! I wish colored people would not thrive on these types of movies just because they contain black actors. Want to see a good African American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or The Color Press. It will be fantastic movies, regardless of the color of the actors' skin. Why? Because they told compelling stories with great acting, it made you feel like you left the theater. Just because it's our experience doesn't make it a good movie. That's just fine - when it's good. Period.
