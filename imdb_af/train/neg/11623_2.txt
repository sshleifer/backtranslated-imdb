From everything I read about the movie, I was excited to support a Christian theme film. Everything about the movie is very unprofessional. Especially the writing! Without good writing, a movie doesn't have a chance. The author / director said in an interview that he did not want to throw away the title related to the story. Believe me, this was not a big surprise. I kept waiting for the teenager / young adult to come back to unfold, but it never did. As someone who went through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would not have been a comfort to me when I experienced the emotional turmoil that separates your life as a Christian!
