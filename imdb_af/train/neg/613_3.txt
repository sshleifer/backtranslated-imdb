Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a common piece of crap. I'm surprised it was rated as high as it did. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: What is NOT wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and clich√©. Here's pretty much what it's about ... Some kind of nerdy kids with no friends are picked up, killed and come back as a scarecrow for revenge. 'All' is packaged in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time watching it. Also, the second one is not much better, so don't bother to see if ... I rated this movie a three because I liked the scarecrow's outfit, not because something was good about the movie no. I think you get the picture.
