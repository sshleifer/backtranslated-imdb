I had no other expectations than to entertain for 90 minutes, and that is exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course it's camp, of course, some of the dialogue wasn't perfect, of course, the "special effects" were a bit hokey. That's exactly why I enjoyed the movie so much. It's a perfect fit for this genre of a 70-year-old Horror classic. <br /> <br /> The talent should start wherever it goes for the actors and the crew and what better material to boost your skills. than that. <br /> <br /> For one, I see another film from these producers and directors.
