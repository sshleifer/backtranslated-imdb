Totally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (obviously the cars are driving slowly), terrifying scripts, frighteningly unsatisfactory end and incompetent direction make a movie of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he must be ashamed of this detritus. There is no big thrill in the car and when the characters stumble in moments of hope, they laugh for a few reasons, even a high five, if they drop the bridge! <br /> <br /> Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car becomes credible. Apparently based on true events, though? If that is the case, then the truth is stranger than fiction! Unfortunately, it is depicted in such an improper manner.
