When I was a child in the 50's and 60's anything related to Disney, it was by definition large. What happened? They can get the best of their time from any actors and actresses they want. But somehow, Disney can find it despite their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, best producers and directors, but still ... they screw things up! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect Disney in their arrogance doesn't even know when a movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It is only because of the talent of the actors that I even make it a 3 out of 10.
