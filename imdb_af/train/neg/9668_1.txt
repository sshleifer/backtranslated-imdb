1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, recorded by a German cameraman with the naive collaboration of the Jewish community, is combined with archival material, cuts of international news rules and excerpts from related cultural films to depict The world's Jews as swindlers and parasites. This 'documentary' interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A sincere, kinematic-unique expression of racial hatred. I find this movie personally scary and highly offensive. One can only hope that such pictures like this will never reach the screen again.
