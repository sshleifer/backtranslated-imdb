How did this ripoff of "Being There" ever become so loved? People say this is proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite a lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The movie proves that happiness is everything: hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not Atari; hope your shrimp boat is the only one at sea when a storm breaks; hope that you will not be shocked if you are shot in the butt and not in the back; hope you don't get Aids from your wife. This film is also politically responsive. Everyone who rebels against the social convention loses their legs, drugs, beats their girls or dies young. In addition, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is outrageous. An emotional manipulative film that is very, very empty.
