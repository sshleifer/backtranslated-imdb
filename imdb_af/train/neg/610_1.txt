I bought this movie on the cheap in a sale, after reading the back of the DVD case and assuming that it could not lose, if it was rubbish, then there was no loss, if it was good , then this is good. /> <br /> Then I watched it ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie he ordered very little screen presence, and he doesn't seem to much does not make his friend's death near the beginning of the "action" in the plot seem to him very little, and his ultimate revenge is just boring and unnatural. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie that themes like Great as Revolution and Revenge can capture the audience and their string to feel something for the characters, but watch this movie feel more like seeing a series of confusion , and almost random events loosely tied to its ultimate conclusion ... <br /> <br /> At this point I was crying ... <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was the most look terrible painful piece I have for Eva. is subject to the scene where the pilot sacrificed himself by refusing to jump out of the explosive charged truck because he does not want to kill civilians, is not so tragic, because it is unnecessarily terrible and painful, although not quite so bad like the emergency operation on the wounded girl. The acting was weak, the writing and the story were poor, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visual" was just not as visual. To summarize, there are good movies, movies that are bad, movies that are so bad, they are good, movies are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then on a whole new level "McBain "
