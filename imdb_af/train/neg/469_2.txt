Mad Magazine can work very crazy people for that ... but of course someone had a bit of common sense when the power-it-rejected this waste of celluloid ... the editing is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off her clothes and we get a nice breast shot ... I never thought I'd feel sorry for Ralph Macchio to make the decision not in this thing, but I do ... and I really feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have been seen in this film ... at least Mr Leibman had the Cajones to refuse his put name anywhere on the movie ... and he comes ahead ... there are actually copies of this thing with Mad's start series still on it ... if you can find one, grab it cuz it's probably worth something ... this is the only thing about this movie that is worth something ... and a note for the people at IMDb.com ... there's no way to spoil this movie. anyone ... the makers disregarded it themselves ...
