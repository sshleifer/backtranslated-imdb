This movie is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - That it's hard to imagine that this year or next year we'll see a worse movie. "Love's Brother" (in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clicks on Italian culture to offer, and it also says that even the Italians speak to and in Italy in the film. The message of the movie - ugly people must marry ugly people, marry beautiful people with beautiful people - is really uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good at movies like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. See this movie at your own risk. Trash as Trash Can!
