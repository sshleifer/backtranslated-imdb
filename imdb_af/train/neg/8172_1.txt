A cannibalistic backwoods killer is on the prowl and two bickering couples can be his next source of protein in this cellar. Friday is the 13th clone cheapie. There is literally nothing important to see in this one, the murder is surprisingly sparse and when it happens, completely amateurish. It also adds ghost into the mix for no reason so ever. I drained after seeing it as if my brain was drowned out and drowned out. And it undoubtedly remains Donald Jones's worst movie. If you're thinking of renting it because of Code Red's snazzy new DVD recharge, don't stumble <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
