Woody Allen has ever made some of the greatest comedies ever and I will seriously consider Annie Hall being the best movie ever, but if I really think about it, I'll probably think of one or two better, but it will be difficult. Of course he had movies that aren't quite good, but not so bad, like Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he never had a movie like Melinda and Melinda. Not quite so tired and so, his movies are usually greasy and hilarious, but how did it happen, is it still our good old Woody? The plot runs around four friends who eat dinner together. Two are writers and one of the others calls a funny story that happened to a friend of her. It's about a young woman bursting unexpectedly on a dinner party. We never hear the rest because the two plays start debating whether it will make a better comedy or tragedy. If we start to see the two views. Both centers on this woman, called Melinda, are having problems with drugs and with her ex-husband. In the tragedy she is an old family friend who, after suicide, tried to appear at her old best friends door without any reason. The comedy is about Melida bumping into the dinner after jumping 28 sleeping pills. Both go on a wild whirlwind of events that never really make sense or fit, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some fun shows by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can't match it. They can't stop it from falling further this year than most other movies.
