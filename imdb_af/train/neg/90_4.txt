: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I waited a long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it was broadcast on Hallmark again on Thursday night. I love the first three "Love" movies, but this one was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole movie was sad and depressed, there were many ways, and the editing was very poor - for many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened far away and Clark's appearance in the movie doesn't seem to fit. It didn't seem like any of the actors really wanted it - they all had no emotion. There was no interaction between Mission and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the scriptwriters had to go through the book more. It looks like every movie made so far just slides away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie, they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark were hurt by it. And I think Mission and Willie's reaction to Kathy's death could have been seen and heard rather than just heard. <br /> <br /> From the four movies made so far, I have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my favorite. I hope with the following four movies that more of the book will be followed and if Clarks character is in them, I hope he has a bigger role and I hope his part is not so mixed up. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the writers are going to have next.
