I've always wanted to see it, because I love cute horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure the incredible meltman would be fun. <br /> <br /> It really wasn't. I mean, the acting was entertainingly bad, the author contains some classic bad lines and the special effects look like someone who played the lead, so I had to love it. Unfortunately, these highlights are really thin. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. This is how boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> However, if you love bad movies, you'll enjoy the dramatic exit of the Fat Nurse, and the stars of the guy Ted play. To be honest with the poor man, he must deliver an incredibly dishonest line with straight face - like the conversation he has with his wife to follow the IM man: <br /> <br /> "I'll get him find with a geiger counter. "" Is he radioactive? " "Just a little bit." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has dr. Ted wanders to try to get a superstrong zombie killer just armed with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails if he gets a large amount of goop on a tree. "Oh God, it's her ear!" says dr. Ted to the audience. I am so glad he made it right. <br /> <br /> I realize I'm making this movie sound pretty nice. It would be if it was only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude just insists on making a tough mess when it comes to eating more people. I think if you were really stoned, you would probably love it, but don't have pop tarts during the movie, because the main actor really looks like one at the end.
