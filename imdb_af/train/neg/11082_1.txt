I know this is a Power-Rangers stick and has taken care of 7-year-olds, but really why were they serious about this movie? If they are going to write a plot with crayons, it has at least the decency to make it stupid. It's kind of hilarious when you see it. We have a typical family filled with cleaved characters (father, a war veteran who has lost his wife and blamed himself LOLOL), air-headed children are trying hard to fill the stereotype, but fail with horrible acting and a legally horrible sidekick do not serve. to the movie, but to fill room space. Funny things! <br /> <br /> But the right moment comes close to the end when the war father and the bad-acting villain try to work a sword fight, but then they realize that none of them knows how to because there is no budget for choreographers), so they enter this American Gladiator-type environment to walk around. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they are trying to treat it seriously.
