I had high expectations for this movie. I thought the point of departure was interesting. I sat there, though I found the play, except Helena Bonham Carter, unbeatable. I was hoping my time would be spent but eventually I left and wondered why they even bothered to make this thing. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a worthwhile message. When this movie reached something, it inspired me to read Orwell's classics. I find it hard to believe his story can be as disappointing as this adaptation. As the filmmaker's message is, "everyday life is worth living", well, they have succeeded. I would not recommend this movie to anyone; Wasted 101 minutes of my life.
