Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his audience. His youthful jokes, stupid songs and daft dances went off well, as he was able to engage people and draw them into his outside world. A lack of a lively audience was a clear disadvantage to him, and he was never comfortable in movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, is adapted to make the most of his talents, but Askey the artist must be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support in the film isn't strong, including regular fellow Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a brave honeymoon couple; Linden Travers goes over the top as a 'crazy woman'. Peter Murray-Hill, who is married on the screen, is also Phyllis Calvert, who is the nominal leading man, who has given a very nice lecture on the part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who does an equally careless . It's left to character actress Kathleen Harrison to steal the movie effortlessly as a parrot loving single woman who is broken on Dr Morland Graham's brandy.
