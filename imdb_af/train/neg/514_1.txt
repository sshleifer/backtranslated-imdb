It is one of the most indifferent, ill-considered, inexhaustible and senseless films ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an attractive movie. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiring series of films that seek to earn money for Smokey and the Bandit's success, which I think is the best movie of them all. As for the waste of movie material, Burt Reynolds walks his way through the movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors are not given much to do, the motorsport is of course stock images, the humor is uninspired and many of the screens are more boring and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply an unnecessary film with nothing unique or characteristic about it.
