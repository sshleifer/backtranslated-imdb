'The Fox and the Child' is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary 'March of the Penguins'. 'It focuses on a young girl (played wonderfully by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her floral friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are some real magic moments here; a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-driven forest; A particular scene in particular when the fox is tormented by a pack of wolves is sometimes intense and even frightening. However, there is simply not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; cinematography is brilliant. The bubbly kind of movie watching is wonderful. This is undoubtedly a very luxurious production. <br /> <br /> The English version is told by Kate Winslet, but what little dialogue has been there is very poorly baptized. The score is also too fluffy, or at least it's nice to me; and the screenplay, while subtle, jumping from one scenario to another, eventually overtaking me. <br /> <br /> While there is a nice moral in the heart of the movie, and the quiet performance of Noël-Bruneau is very beautiful, the real star is the fox. Those fascinating moments that focus exclusively on our furry friend are great. But again, there is simply not enough of them. <br /> <br /> - Keeping up with all the latest movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more, visit www.mybluray. com.au
