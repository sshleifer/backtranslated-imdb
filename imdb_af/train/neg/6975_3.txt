Oh God, what an idiotic movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by one man in a lame costume) and stupid plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they are simply ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such annoying characters as in this junk (this dumb child or pregnant woman with his husband and more). All in all, it's a great entertainment if you're drunk. like the plague. Is I drunk too? I do not think so ...
