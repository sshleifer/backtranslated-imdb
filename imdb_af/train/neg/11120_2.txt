You know a movie is bad when its peak a short moment of "Jeopardy!" Can see. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about White Men can't jump, it's a huge potential. For a few years I lived in this area as depicted in this movie; racial tension was high and basketball meant everything to everyone. A movie about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and weak manuscript in White Men could not have left Job. <br /> <br /> The movie's sequence of events is cyclic. First, Billy wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returned with his girlfriend to his home and lounge. and the process is repeated. Most stories build to a climax of one kind or another, but the "climax" I saw was just a series in this repetition (in this case, "Billy wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball "). <br /> <br /> To develop a plot, some dilemma must be solved; And this dilemma should be interesting if the film is also interesting. Apparently, White Men writers can't forget this rule, as the plot can be summed up as "Billy has to pay the bills." I have appreciated the pace of other formal sports movies, but it is a pity that it was just terrible. I could have taken less care if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite this, White Men Can not Jump can be a successful movie. Apparently, some adamant sports lovers will dismiss horrible writing for a few basketball scenes in them. Others, I'm sure, have been lured by the big names that play the lead. It makes me wonder if the cast was completely replaced with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced by lacrosse. Would anyone have bothered to watch this movie? I really don't think so. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie two stars out of ten; The extra star is for the "Jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
