This film about secret government thought experiments and the corrupt use of citizenship by mysterious and dirty shadow figures has the potential to be a very interesting movie. But for me it failed. I won't work out much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you're looking for a detailed explanation, the comment from the user gives 'reluctantpopstar' a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But it didn't work for me. I found it slow, which would be good, but for the fact that it doesn't look anywhere. The viewer is in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie in some movies. One can argue that the film makers were meant to think and leave things unclear for that reason. I don't think that's the case. <br /> <br /> As for the regular long shots of two buildings often mentioned by other users, I see that they have a point. give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "action". And I suspect many viewers will welcome the opportunity to get several drinks on board to get through this one.
