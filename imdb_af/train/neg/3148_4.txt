Essentially a story of man towards nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the sumptuous Ceylon jungles and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film never really goes on. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later recorded on the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the control of Mr Peter Finch's late father, whose spirit throws an elephant over pole, which becomes an important point of dispute between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to return their traditional path to water that was blocked when the house was built over their legal path. The animals go on a rampage and offer the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have a few good moments because she's struggling to stay a loyal wife, despite having Finch marital problems.
