Teen All Hope is a very poor, sometimes painful, film. It's Michael Madsen's first movie, and it shows, he's not that good at it. Some people may find the story ridiculous; An alcoholic realizes his life and family fall apart, and he calls a preacher a last resort for help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepted Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> I actually found a lot of religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church, but goes away from there, pretty realistically. I also liked how Cecil knows his life is apart and trying to get help, but just realize that God can help him. In the end, he realized with the help of God that he could go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well made. The acting is bad, the writing can use any work, and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you're a Christian doesn't mean you can automatically stop an addiction or cure your broken family, and Cecil realizes it and works hard to stay on the right track. Overall, as your Christian, you will appreciate how this film depicts Christianity and if you are not, you may be called to find out more about faith.
