Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo outbursts" (they now have pills!) Is probably the worst element of this show. It really goes on with the best formula of the Highlander series. The hero immortal touches another immortal with flashbacks over the last time they met, but there is conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effect sequence. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unedited 90's hero, with the typical "Sexual Stress" storyline. (Seriously, why do you think Hollywood, sexual tension thinks is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint Canadian / French production, so half of the series is in Vancouver to New York, and the other half is in Paris. Just like Highlander did.
