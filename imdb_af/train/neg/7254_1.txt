Who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews was either involved in making this movie, using futures or bankrolls, and if the latter were to happen, I'd have my seven dollars back! The actors, again term used, are terrible, and virtually nothing of them ever did anything that was a relief. The scenery and everything about this scream, we had 7 bucks to work with and a day to do it. Was it filmed in someone's backyard? Everything about this project says, low budget. The actors at best were D list. Don't waste your time unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rent back. The front bad guy looks like that punk from the 70's who eventually marries his grandmother dummee moore. My local blocking video store lists it as the movie most returned with a sad comment attached. Even if a 99 cents rent, this movie collects dust. Someone really deserves some favor. It's a super stinker and I give it 10 turds.
