What an insult to the SA movie industry! I saw better SA movies. The comments I read about Hijack Stories, saying it's worth a dozen out of ten, are quite scary. A film's rating should not depend on ..., "OH, A FILM FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. LETS BOOST ITS INDUSTRY THAT NEW THINGS ARE WORKING, ALSO IT IS BATH." We have the expertise to make good movies. Don't judge the movie industry about what people say is how big they think Hijack Stories are. We can tell good stories like the beloved Country and Shaka Zulu. Shout the beloved Land, I give 9 out of 10. Great direction by Darryl, great acting by two great elderly actors, no matter where they are. Kapingsverhale. I give 1 out of 10. It can only be people involved in the project, which will give it high scores. I would have done the same if it was my movie.
