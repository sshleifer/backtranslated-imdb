I love the music of the Clash and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I was hoping for this movie to learn more about the man behind most of it. But I came out of the theater and didn't know much more about Joe than I already did after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The movie never really comes to the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was gather the small stuff they had, shaky vague videos, and keep a few people on Joe Strummer at a campfire. It seems that most of these people didn't know him very much or at all, and that the director just wanted them to say more famous people: "Oh, he was such an inspiration to us all." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who apparently asked for his pirate costume to take advantage of his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems as if the director couldn't wait until the body was cold before throwing in to sell his version of the "biggest punk rocker and hippie at heart" that ever lived, sanctified the person without really having enough of him. to know. <Br /> <br /> Of course, as a fan, I enjoyed seeing the images of the band, hearing the anecdotes behind the songs, and so on, but in the end I felt like it was left as the portrait of Joe Strummer could easily tell in 60 -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie if you're a fan, otherwise listen better to the music of the Clash or, even better, the undeserved unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer culminated in his musical development . his death, all his rich influences merged into one wonderful sound.
