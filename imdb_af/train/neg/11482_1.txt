You've seen it when you met Sally, then avoid this one. Not only will it make you slap your head on the table, because why Bollywood can't just make a good remake; but also irritate you with the so-called funny moments in it. The charm of the movie is lacking. Ranee looks terrible. Saif is trying to act as if he were one actor's hell. The plots picked up from the original also do not look effective. The part where they both bring their friends together and hit a note just doesn't look attractive. What could be more disastrous? You want to waste money, that's what you can get. Otherwise, put a little more money and look at the original. It's too good to miss.
