"What the Bleep We Know!?" was one of the worst times I spent at the movies. It was less of a movie and more of an after-school but at the same time nothing special. The attempt at a story based on their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost everyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear just doesn't have to happen. I won't stay there. What I will reveal is a criticism that many cannot formulate. This movie, while nicely, also suffered a tremendous mistake in reasoning. It was terribly contradictory because it was so manipulative, became a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, inexorable propaganda. Interconnection is explained as a large party of ours. However, the film encourages us to control our environment with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with thoughts that we can control, which is more apparent. Or at least the structures in which we exist are largely limited. In this way, the film was inappropriate solipsist. Solipsism and interconnection do not interfere if you are God Almighty. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) Through all the neat things this movie will reveal to you. If not, you'll be very disappointed, a moron, or maybe both. Also the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble warning people not to see the movie, because I feel slow to name it. Shame on everyone involved.
