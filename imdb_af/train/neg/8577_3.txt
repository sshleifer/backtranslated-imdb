I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, if you haven't lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why someone wants a new coke or a Pet Rock (and honestly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, understand I'm not quite sure yet. They are just a few things that make sense right now, but the younger generation really baffles. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (mostly the 1940s) they were very popular and had enough that the studio played with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. Still, if you didn't live at that time (it was good before my time), you wonder why someone liked this kind of "entertainment". Kyser and his teammates are incredibly stupid and their humor is very, very broad (ie, unsophisticated and cheesy). Honestly, I couldn't stand their antics, and didn't appreciate that there were just too many music numbers in the movie. Because of these factors, the big supporting role-player is given a back seat and fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie involves Kyser and the band comes to a house where a young woman and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange events begin. Eventually, it culminates in some efforts on Sally's life and a seance (kind). It's all played for the laugh - and it's not really a horror movie despite the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the best entertainment. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I felt like I was watching Kyser and his knuckle heads.
