The movie wasn't a waste, except for some boring scenes in between. But the women gave a pretty good performance as the men laughing. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really smelled in the movie. His voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in bed with Krista had to be shortened, but she had made it so visible and more sexy than anyone could do. Krista really is one of the best in such roles. In the last 5 minutes, she also considered quiet and weak. This is the interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds wasn't that good and it wasn't his best as an action star. He could have chosen a better script than that. I think he did for money.
