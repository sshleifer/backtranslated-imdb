Without wanting to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the dull and snapped movies I've ever seen - one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, the pressure is slim, and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you can do yourself better". Perhaps it is a challenge for everyone to satisfy youtube with our own zombie-related crap? <br /> <br /> I bought it for Â£ 1 but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You can do it well to avoid this turkey, even at a cellar price.
