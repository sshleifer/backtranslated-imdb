Obviously, Hideo Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu, not Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with tips from Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but horrible gore (a green body with red eyes!) poor story, and a bad theme (I find it very difficult to find a picture message). There were two moments in this movie that made me shake, both with an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, this one in 1999) made me feel for a few minutes after seeing it and All the movies it steals From was actually scary, I can't see this movie as anything but a sale to the western popularity of big Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
