This movie is so bad I can't even describe it. What's in the burning pit wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this horror? The plot is laughing, the scene is poor in the best, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is good, but then hold it back on until you turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest loser not to turn off the mute movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he's in there ... for 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 out of 10 because it offers the lowest grade IMDb. <br /> <br /> Doing yourself a favor: See a yours Boll movie rather ... twice ... it's worth your time.
