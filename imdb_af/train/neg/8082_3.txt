It was one of those late night. "That's there." I saw it. Sometimes they are wonderful. This one was terrible, but it really shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> The movie played a very good role. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about Oscar winners error here. It had good special effects. It even had some very good titles! And I mean nicely shown, full breast with full nipple and at one point even a cup. But it did not compensate for the one missing ingredient - a story! The plot was ridiculous. I don't mean the "solar crisis" explosions, but it was bad enough. It was the rest of the things - the oh so stupid and completely predictable evil corporate things. Man who doesn't STANK! No amount of good acting or cool spaceships or fenders could get around that one. <br /> <br /> I saw that the same cast members are incredibly good. I saw wonderful science fiction movies that had minimal roles and budgets. All the difference is in writing.
