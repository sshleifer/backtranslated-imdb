Prohibited Siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s) games. Like most video games twisted movies, I would say the majority don't really translate into another medium. And this is also painful for this one. <br /> <br /> There is a fairly long prologue explaining the story, and the mysterious island on which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) comes to move in. The residents don't look too friendly, and soon there is good advice about the siren on the island, to stay inside as soon as the siren starts crying. <br /> <br /> Of course, things are starting to stumble, and our brothers and sisters are on a mission to hit the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its foreigners. But in truth, you won't bother with what's going on, as folklore and fairy tales are thrown in to double the plot. What really pushes it into the realm of the bad comedy is the subconsciously badly-placed-out-of-the-norm moments that only expressed zealous giggles in its sheer stupidity until later explained. This is one thing that is trying to stand up and present something awkward, but another thing makes it convincing and covered with loopholes. <br /> <br /> Despite slipping within 90 minutes, I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have it as a runtime measure - it gives almost two hours of feeling with its slow build up to tell whatever it wants. Things are starting to pick up for the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little. <br /> <br /> What the movie saves is how it changes and its revelation at the end. Again, it is a common device used to increase a seemingly simple horror movie to something, a little extra hoping to wow an audience. It turned out quite satisfactorily, but looks like a bad aftertaste, because you will be slightly deceived. There are two ways in which a twist will make you feel - it raises the film at an unforgettable level, or gives you the feeling. Unfortunately, Forbidden Sirens belong to the latter. <br /> <br /> The economy will be cinematography with the use of lights, shadows and mirrors, but I'll be explicit - it's still not worth it, so better to avoid it.
