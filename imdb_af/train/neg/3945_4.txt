My Name's Modesty is a low-budget movie that tells the story of Modesty Blaise's origins. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's not just what I expect or hope. While I have been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not too familiar with the comics or graphic novels, so I come to this movie as something like an outsider. This can be part of the reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The movie is dialogue driven. I guess I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name's modesty is a deadly serious movie. There are very few, if any, moments. The acting, at least of Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others commented, it seems to be too weak to be completely credible in the title role. What action scenes are there in My Name Modesty is one of the films' worst points. I never bought in the idea that this woman could handle a group of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumors a big budget movie based on the Modesty Blaise character. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I will look forward to it a lot.
