I have also endured hundreds of children's films in the past. This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) Today and older, I pervert to explain to my children that Russia is not the bad guys. The cartoon Russian names like "Poopchev" are also inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The grandfather's birthday party scene features a quasi-sexist joke in which he meant men talking beer and women, talking on the phone. Two other flies also use the word "crap" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie claps most of the stereotypes and propaganda of 1950 I thought we were proud of as a nation. br /> <br /> In all, it's just rough, poorly animated, even more badly written and not worth the time wasting.
