The battle scenes play like slow-motion Jackie Chan and the efforts on the white are pathetic (worst wordplay far: "Guess what? This time I heard you."). The stars are a mismatched pair: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screenplay - things Dolph Lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). Note to the director: Please stay away from any love shows, especially if your main actress doesn't do nudity and you need to make a double use on a body. (* 1/2)
