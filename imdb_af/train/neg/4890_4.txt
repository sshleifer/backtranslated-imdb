A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a Mountie man she loves ... but she also loves sex! In the course of the movie she gets more men in bed - including her husband AND brother! There is also a (tame) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critical award-winning X rated movie ever. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, it's not good. <br /> <br /> It's well-aimed and Erica Gavin is just big (whatever has happened to her), and it was very colorful ... but according to today's standards it's very easy. I'm surprised it now has an NC-17 rating - there's no hardcore sex and it only has women and no male nudity topless. Also, this is (unfortunately) pretty boring and the addition of politics to the end was confusing (and pretty stupid). However, it is worth seeing what was considered very shocking in 1968. I saw the cut version (which has an R rating), but I only heard a few seconds here and there was missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" is much better and dates very well. Capture it instead.
