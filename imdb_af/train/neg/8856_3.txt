Lee presented the 100 Years of Horror to Ted Newsom and talked about cinematic werewolves. He said something was his only brush with lycantropy The Howling II, then he said: "The less said about it the better." Indeed, he was right, as this movie may be the worst in his entire screen of screen action. The first Howling by Joe Dante was a pioneering werewolf film with its amazing special effects and its campus sense of style and subject. It was a movie that had to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more champion successors were needed rather than the first time (see CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles away from the first one on each front. There is absolutely nothing about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black by most of the big scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film to mention (okay, I'll also cede Ferdy Mayne). Lee looks ashamed for talking in dialogue and doing ridiculous things (see what ends up with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what it is that is a little more informative than the two people who leave America leave to go to Romania. The story isn't really worth investigating here. And you can bet there is very little story to mention when you have to play Stephen Parsons and his band Babel by the beginning of the movie and the end of that terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and yes, she denies once and then, we get that scene again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten - but could have been so far from my mind). I gave the movie three stars, but it really gets zero. The three I gave are 1 for Lee and two for me. Danning's contributions. Bah!
