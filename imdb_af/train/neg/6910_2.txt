I've never seen this movie, but can tell you one thing about its production. While in 1988 I was a comedy / oldies radio DJ, I received a call from the production company. They asked if I would write and record a bit that they would drop in the soundtrack, as sounds came from a TV (the television screen itself will never be shown). I sure said, wrote a parody of a 50-year-old sci-fi monster clich√©, rounded off a few sound effects and asked another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. While on the air, she tackled a long song, joined the microphone in the production room, and cut the ballot into a single cut. Giggling, she then went back to her show while mixing in the goofy sound effects. We would never have done that if we knew "Woodchipper Massacre" would be such a turkey - but then we never paid for our efforts again! - Gary Theroux
