This is a rip of the old Frankenstein premium. An award-winning scientist is killed in an accident and his father, a well-known brain surgeon, saves the brain. It is then placed in a robot body of its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the 'colossus' impetus to move thoughts. The whole project goes bad when creation goes berserk. <br /> <br /> Special effects are undeveloped. The script is missing. And it's humorous that it's not scary. Well, many small children will think it's good. If you are awake three o'clock in the morning and it comes on .... night, night. <br /> <br /> The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the 'Colossus'.
