I really have problems judging this movie. It is brilliantly targeted, of course there is a lot of money in it. Gears and Dane are intense (although its sharp personality may use a little more definition and summary), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it's one of the really sick movies you can't help but wonder if the director wants to present specific plays himself, and yes, one can't help but wonder how many copycats will inspire such a movie. /> In purely artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie.
