In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as president of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appears. The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened that year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. Now, in 2009, the movie United States has another president, there is another pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie In Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but It's the same as saying: "Cutting your fingers is better than cutting your head." This sequel is a very bad movie that endures me very bored and uninteresting. The role of Into the Blue 2: The Reef is made up of TV series actors who have absolutely no credibility and dramatic shortcomings. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances. I have some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil I and Ted's Excellent Adventure special), but on this movie he can't generate the minimum tension, emotion or entertainment. The characters of this movie are not only badly executed, but they are also repulsive. I wanted them all. to die. The cinematography of this movie is also paralyzed and seems to have been made by a technical team making promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels. In Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie that is better than the original movie, but it's the same as nothing, as I said earlier. Run this crappy movie at all costs.
