In the beginning and throughout the movie it was wonderful. It was exciting and exciting. Nevertheless, it did not finally give an answer to what had happened. They mysteriously turned into a raven or crow in zombies? It didn't answer the questions we all had and was not as good a movie as I thought it would be.
