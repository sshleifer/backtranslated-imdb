I'm willing to make lots of late spring / summer action fluff movies, but overall it's due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payouts (ie cool special effects, interesting plots, comic value, Steve Buscemi , etc.). However, this movie had nothing to do with it. All we got was the cheap excitement of a few minutes of Eva Longoria's cleavage (a matter of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassment of a lack of plot, tension, background story, character development, continuity, etc. I will get in detail, but honestly, I have already forgotten most of the movie already. <br /> <br /> The whole time I was in the theater, I kicked myself because I didn't spend DVD on a 24-hour just on the afternoon. Save your money on this one, people. Unless you really like Eva Longoria's fission.
