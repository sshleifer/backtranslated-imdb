The only connection this movie has to make is that it is terribly unforgiving. I'd rather stick my finger with a rusty nail than put it through again. Even for a TV movie it is flat. The throw is boring. The script is as exciting as a basin of sand. How two directors conspired to create such a movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene that is even blurred in the Omen franchise, and it is being shot in slo-mo and shortly after the expected installment. If you are requested to see it, print it, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With any luck you go away quickly, and the alarm will wake you up as soon as the worst is over. Namely, this movie.
