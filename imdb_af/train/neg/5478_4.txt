With nothing better to do, I decided to investigate "Aztec Rex" (as it was billed). <br /> <br /> The silly story may have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. They actually looked like animations (the rough designs that artists later use to complete the CGI effects, add more details, smoother movements, etc.). Absolutely horrible dinosaurs, which is the only reason you're probably anyway want . <br /> <br /> The one redeeming factor was the beautiful Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget was set up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least, the cast and crew have a free trip to Hawaii, where the film is filmed.
