When I heard the plot for this movie, I just had to see it, I mean that whole cities are swept up by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is as funny as it gets. <br /> <br /> Led by detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never takes off his SCUBA outfit and Lt. Finletter who has never been pictured without his parachute at the back) 'Attack of the killer Tomatoes' is a parody of B films, especially Japanese horror of the 1950s. The movie starts with a standard measure of tomato discovered by a woman in her kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime scene, as the tomato is believed to have killed this lady. Let me tell you that it doesn't get any clean. as the film progresses! To be honest, there are some funny moments, for example, when the Japanese scientist dr. Nokitofa speaks that his voice was proclaimed in an American accent, or when disguise conflict, Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes, can someone please forward the ketchup? . Likewise, this movie was probably much better in 1978, with the very bad its good concept. Unfortunately, this type of comedy has been much better since the 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' show films such as the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series released and released. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible; There is zero continuity in editing and it just feels really slow and without energy. For a parody movie to work on, you need many things right away, one stomach to the ear. The song in the movie seems pointless and the advertisements for the furniture store flashing over the screen are right-sided, even for this movie. Ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult; I can't see many people being indifferent. Unfortunately, it will be terrible as I would sum it up.
