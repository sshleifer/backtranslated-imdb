CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is clear that the series has come to a natural end with the best entries such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and mid-late 60's SCREAMING. <br /> <br /> In itself, MATRON It's not bad, it's just that we've seen it with a thin plot before (a lot of nails are trying to go to a hospital for a precaution stealing contraceptive pills that they plan to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags of a little amusing but unsophisticated nature. I think this is where the problem lies - The gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature that begins to show its age. Do we need another movie that a man who has been adapted to a woman uses to manage the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is the fact that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I have a problem remembering a very funny line. This is a serious problem for a comedy
