I think this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman movie, as it is just as crumbly and painfully long as the original. After an opening scene made entirely of dark intergalactic visuals, the credits pay tribute to the day-to-day look-out-of-time futuristic hotspots of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> There are still dark things. Ma Kent sees a little rough shrub on the farm, and spends a good part of my life and slowly walks on a debris in the lawn. Then Superman sneaks to her and falls. <br /> <br /> Next, Lex Luthor will be in a scene of very dull close-ups of an old lady as she dies. We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early example of the movie's drive to release no cut stone. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he's not human. He also probably doesn't like people, as the movie sometimes contains some plot about Lex Luthor's plan to kill most of the Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent shows up at his old job (I forgot to mention, he was on a five-year trip where nothing happened). Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and dates Cyclops. It makes him so bad that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame. <br /> <br /> At this stage we see Miss Lane on a kind of spacecraft. This is an important event because it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room who monitor this event. There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cabin. The film reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them most of the summer. <br /> <br /> As the events that led to the inevitable disaster started, I apologized for cooking. I accidentally returned to the wrong theater and watched the movie about Al Gore showing slides as a whole. I tried to come back to Superman Returns, but I somehow walked in Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then I had time to quit. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, got my seat, and looked up to see that the looming Lane spacecraft was almost on us. Yet it seems to be forever, so I went around the theater, met a girl, married, raised a boy and sent him to college. While attending my son's medical school ceremony, I remember probably being on Superman Returns. So I excused myself and just returned to the theater to learn that there was no need to hurry. It took about half an hour for things to go wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was pretty cool. <br /> <br />. And then there's a subplot where Superman really gets creepy and Lois Lane and her family bump with his x-ray vision and super-trial. Then he tries to cheat her on Cyclops, which looks like a good guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of game to show every possible generic rogue behavior before the end of the movie. . I forgot to bring my scorecard with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he shot dead almost 100 percent. I hope he wins the million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point things are starting for the big dark final. I think maybe the projector was broken, because the movie was in a kind of loop for a while. I remember uncomfortable things coming out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, back to the dark things, being sick again, waiting, he's good again. <br /> <br /> When Lex Luthor released his final release bad man: screaming for his girlfriend a little. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and returned. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Nineteen years later, the nursing home I lived in felt a bit cold. I realized I had left my jersey back in the theater, and I went to fetch it. When I did that, I was a little surprised to see that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask the viewers what I missed, but most of them were just long gray beard skeletons. <br /> <br /> I went back to my old seat and watched Lois Lane sit around her house for a while. Then Superman arrived and started the movie, and since I saw that part, I thought it was good to leave. <br /> <br /> This is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <Also, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you'll love this movie. Based on that, there are two jokes like that.
