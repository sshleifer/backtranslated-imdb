I watched the first 15 minutes and thought it was a real documentary (with an annoyingly too dramatic camera maker). <br /> <br /> When I realized that all this had happened, I thought "why would I want to waste My time watching this mess?" So I turned it off and came online to warn other people. The characters do not act in a credible way. too much immature emotion. For a man to travel halfway around the world in a war-torn country, he acted like a child. and I do not believe it was because "his character was so upset about the trade center clashes". <br /> <br /> very thin and stupid. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the "city of lost" kids ?, a French dark fantasy movie about a man kidnapping children and stealing their dreams ... I enjoyed it!
