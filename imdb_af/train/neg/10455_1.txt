$ 25,000 Pyramid Clues: Deep Blue Sea. Tremor. Sailing. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies that are more fun and exciting than snakes on a plane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with that definition I have to include the relatively heartbreaking journey of Ted and Elaine in airplane! as better than snakes in both laughter and excitement. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that it's not even close to the mom of all the unintentional deliberate snake movies: Anaconda! Apart from the fact that JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer is never seen again, Jon Voight has played the everyday movie. His final scene alone represents everything SOAP has tried and failed to do as a "so-ridiculous-it-fun" movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is definitely proving that studio executives and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible. Every major scene has been discussed and disciplined for the past year. All that was left to relax by opening the evening was the amount of fanboy sweats that had to be packed on my theater. I was more forced to laugh here than on a studio for "According to Jim".
