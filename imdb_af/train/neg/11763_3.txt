Yes. I will admit it. I believed all the hype around this piece was about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in Mexico City over their sexual lives. And so, I really expected to finally see a Mexican movie (ages) that was popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the movie was totally disappointing. The story gives us two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third party comes into the life of every couple, their problems come as a key point. Or absolutely absurd. The plot then changes into a battle of the generations. The position of each group (yes, they literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is blatantly dumb and childish (I think the humor should be there). And it's all going from bad to worse. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera. The flat conditions that form the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of which generation in an adult relationship, etc., make the movie fail. Miserably. SPyL had an (impressive) good reception at the cashier's office. Believe the hype at your own risk.
