Christ. A sequel to one of the most fluttering films of all time, it has at least the decency to leave the songs (a repeat of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but remains the tradition of deceptive and rude. This time Annie and her friends go to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The film has a bizarre sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character, contrary to how annoying it is: every time the little bugger catches "Leapin" lizards! "I can feel my teeth grinding in powder. Drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line (" Remember me, your stupid genius! ") And the fact that it is not the original one to put it on do not recommend.
