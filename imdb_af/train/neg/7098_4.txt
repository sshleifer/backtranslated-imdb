An interesting idea for a movie, which shows both the last dragon on earth and shows the battle that he and someone hurt. When he was younger, Einon put in his heart, and Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark gentleman who gave him half his heart. Right now, Einon (David Thewlis) is growing up and is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend Draco the Dragon (pronounced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for killing dragons. But because Einon heard half of Draco's, they both felt the pain in one of them hurt or killed. Also with Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. It was nominated for the Oscar for the best visual effects. Was Watching!
