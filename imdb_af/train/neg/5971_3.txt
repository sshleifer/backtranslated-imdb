I was talking to watch this movie by a friend about how a cute story it was. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want to get back two hours, as I could have done so much more productive things with my time ... like twiddle my thumbs. I see nothing about this movie except for the eye-candy aspect of it ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and it's generous)
