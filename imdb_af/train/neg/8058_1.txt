Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good wrong, I decided to pick up this one instead of returning the living dead from all movies. I haven't seen one yet, but to consider it is one of the highly acclaimed horror movies ever, safe to say I made the wrong choice. There is nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about the so-called superior killer cut. It doesn't even have the youthful sex appeal from mediocre to poor movies as I know what you did last summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It simply made no sense, had no excitement, had very little acting or compelling writing. The release time has apparently been postponed for some years, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes down as a lot of meaningless scenes that are randomly thrown to meaningless effects. Get Wrong Turn Rather Than You Want to See Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I don't think it could even see the movie. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunt, is terrible here - he seems to lack both intelligence and intestines. That's enough on this one.
