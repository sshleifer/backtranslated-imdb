Unfortunately, IMDb doesn't let me judge lower than 1. What a shame. This horrible movie is so bad that I really rejected the damn thing before the end. The script had a few sharp moments, but directing, editing, acting, sound quality, and especially the timing of line delivery was so horrible as to make judges completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Judges were advertised as a modern day cartoon style western, but in reality nothing was of the kind. What it is most like is dog cap on the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it's good, but it just stinks. Why video stores think it's good to wear this kind of crap with constant gaps in the sound and worse than high school drama acting is outside of me. We rent movies to see something better than television. But Judges are worse than the most pathetic Scifi channel original. I'm planning to claim my money back from Hollywood Video.
