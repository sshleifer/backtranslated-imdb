This movie could have been a decent B-movie if 3/4 of the film didn't focus much on the sex scene. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure there will be more to sex addicts without having sex on a constant basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering everything he had to do, which wasn't much. At some point you have to laugh at him, because his character was so miserable. Nastasja Kinski was good at her role as the worried sex therapist, she could have done even more and I didn't suggest having sex. The person who showed me the most in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and worried woman. There is something about beautiful inside and outside that strongly addresses me. She played that role and if you watched the movie, you started to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict", while Oscar material or a modern classic does not meet anyone's standards, is fairly informative and does a fair job to show you how your personal devils can take over and destroy many things in life that you think.
