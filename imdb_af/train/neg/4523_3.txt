When released this movie has one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a surprising way. The casting is stupid, starting from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough make-up in Cairo for that, at least while this film was made. But it is quite amusing to see them try. The performances are the spectrum of mummy-like (sorry, obvious observation) to the top, with very few intervals. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems to be unable to find Egypt on a map, much less on its archaeological treasures. It is at least partly due to some very bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited on every viewer of this movie. It is my opinion that movies that include a curse or their basis of a subject that is esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ripe for a stupid, overwritten dialogue. It does not disappoint, and the convergence proves ambiguous. The plot has one driving force of dramatic tension: Can it become thinner and less credible? The answer is usually YES. The location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminder that it was not a low-budget production. This and the fact that so many familiar faces are used in such an unintentional heavier. Cheap, no; cheesy, yes.
