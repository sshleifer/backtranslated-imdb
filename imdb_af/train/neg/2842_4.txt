I'm in awe! Wow, prepare to be blown away by the uncomfortable ways of the ninja. Look at them as they crawl on the ground (on their back or stomach), like a caterpillar, climb through the air, build buildings, hide and jump out of trees, throw ninja stars, roll out blue wipes, disappear into smoke bombs, make A lot of swoosh sounds with their blades and sobs fast or over their toes. What a face! Really, I could go over the many traditional actions, but I'll be here all day. Oh, let's not forget we'll even show up on the legendary Chuck Connors, and watch him send ninjas with his shotgun with little ease. Which class! What a badass! Anyway, the ultra-cheap Sakura Killers are a few stupid, but cheesy ninja action fun, that only fanatics of the genre would get something out of this bumpy debacle. <br /> <br /> A genetic laboratory in America has a very important video stolen by some ninjas. Two Americans are sent to Japan by Colonel (Chuck Connors) to recover it. <br /> <br /> Opening the feature sets it up nicely. Get ready for the laugh! Then it gets slower, but shortly after the two main characters learn about the ninja and go through the training, it gets a steam heap, because they break costumes and flee to the stolen beta band that contains a very important formula. This is when the violent action and aerobic art really come in. It's also not too shy (like the moronic script and daft performances). The final climate conference was done very well. <br /> <br /> In the slow stretch, the two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) looked at the matter, shared brainless conversations and experienced minor issues. What made me laugh was how the Ninjas were deterred by how brave and clever these two were. It was supposed to be professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ('Effects (1989)') does a serious job with what he has and plays it for what it is. He centers the screen activities around the striking Taiwan locations. The score is a chintzy arrangement.
