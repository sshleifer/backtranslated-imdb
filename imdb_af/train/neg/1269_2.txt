This series gets 2 stars just because it puts some of Dickens's Bleak House on film and maybe someone will read the book. Unlike most likely advice, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. She was clunky and wood. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr Jarndyce. So I'll interrupt myself and respond to all the people who say, "I didn't read the book, so I don't have to take this man's opinion because he bases his evaluations on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role due to poor acting or reading the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a pleasant Jarndyce (though too old). The series fails because it is unfair to compare it with the book, but because the different plot lines and characters merely merge to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and entertaining entertainment. It is dull and flat. If you want to make a good home, spend 20 hours of filming in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest producers etc. Dickens left alone (even a Christmas Carol). Television kills Dickens' genius as revealed in its inventive plots and memorable characters.
