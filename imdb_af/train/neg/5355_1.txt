Now I don't hate cheap movies. I just don't see why you have to waste money on a movie you can shoot with your dad's video camera. If I hire a movie, I want it to be a movie, and not a lot of people think it would be a good idea to waste a few MiniDV tires. Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was wonderful and it wasn't. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, has the stupid plot, EVER, the most unrealistic characters, EVER, and the really, really, VERY WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of movies. Even Tom Savini can't save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this one is a total waste of time.
