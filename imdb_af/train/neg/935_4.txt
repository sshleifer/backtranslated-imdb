Users who rated this movie so high simply couldn't have seen enough good movies to compare it to. Are they all brainwashing? I rarely felt so disappointed about a movie and some of it must be attributed to the ridiculous hype around this movie. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BU is just a hunting movie. We take it to the end of one chase and go straight to the other. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time wasted on plot, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the other two Bourne movies, you're pretty lost. If you - you just got WISH, you were lost - somewhere a long way from a theater. <br /> <br /> Paul Greengrass's passionate style worked excellently on United 93, which was overloaded with a desperation that was desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his tireless misery it just resulted from the removal heard from involvement in the character. He ran. He jumps. He pushes. He is blown up. He cleans tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he survives. He survives as a plastic action man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he draws more and more slits and lacks in any kind of tension. So he drove off a building? Approximately? He'll survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There is a girl being thrown into the mix, because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. I saw more character depth and funny dialogue in Captain Scarlet's episodes. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is boring and formless and tells us nothing we don't know about the first movie. He was transformed into a murder machine. Great story. He finds his true identity. Approximately? It has no emotional resonance when it comes. <br /> <br /> The 'twist' end is telegraph and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this movie, the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 while writing this comment! I'll finish better before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is also not. It's a hard, boring set of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that it is "the way forward" to the Bond franchise is utterly crap. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
