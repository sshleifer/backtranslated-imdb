Yes, I'm just going to tell you about this one, so don't read if you want surprises. I have this one titled Christmas Evil. There was also a Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While the silent night, bloody night (not confused with quiet night, deadly night) had much potential and was very close to being good, it was not so good. It's interesting enough to look at the villain (if you can call him) to look at the area's kids and write in books about who is naughty and beautiful, but after a while you are looking for an action and this movie do not deliver. You need character development, but it's going to be overboard and you're still not sure why the dick is catching the man. About an hour he kills three out of four people while a whole crowd watches, and the guys he kills are not even his targets, they just make fun of him. This is one of the many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to beat the naughty. He then tries to kill this other man, and he tries to break into his house by pushing himself into the fireplace. He quickly got stuck and barely managed to get out. He then goes through the basement and then tries to kill the man by smothering him in his bedroom. He didn't look the man so dead, so he grabbed a star from the tree and slipped the guys throat. What was the tree in the first place, even in the bedroom? Oh yes, the killer before death stopped at a party and also had fun. Well, that's about it, except that the villagers chase him with torches and share the unsolved with his brother and the song he wants to play. What did it look like? He said something that was never really explained. How do you finish what you ask for I have spoilers, I'll tell you. He walks off the road in his bus and goes on, now we can only say it was lamb !!!!!!!!!!!!
