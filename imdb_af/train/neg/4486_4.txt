What was hell about it? I saw the matrix and was surprised. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What the Wachowski brothers ever had to do this movie is outside of me. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can't argue with it. Actually, this movie was a talk of talking, and I'm not mistaken, I have no problem with talky movies, but all the talks in The Matrix Reloaded were an unrelenting cargo. Then there will be a battle series that took WAY too long, then more senseless driving, then another battle show that lasts too long and builds everything into the biggest anti-climax ever. A little beard kid speaks a little incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Also, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance. I knew he wasn't a good actor, but it was out of joke. If you look at his movies in the order he was in them, it seems that he got worse when they went along. God knows what his performance is like in something to be given! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden boards to ever become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first movie, it came as a massive dissapointment. If you haven't seen the first movie yet, I suggest you see it, but don't waste your time with this whole hope. <br /> <br />
