I glued to the screen, clipped, given, but with an obvious eye. I waited for the next terrific special effect, or the next ridiculous plot item to find full power, so I could learn how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> They seem to be able to make it movie, the crew has every other action / science fiction / shoot-em-up / good vs. evil movie ever made, watched and watched cool things, saying, "Hey, we can do it." For example, the only car parked in a mile that looks like a one-way road with a shoulder that is not meant for parking, is the one car, the main character, throwing an attractive brunette born of gall. . The car shattered before she even landed on it. Of course, the special effects were my biggest beef with this movie. But what it really put in my bad books was the impossibility and the lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying devil with the ability to damage bizarre ways, happens on a wage army truck carrying a major VIP. Nameless security guys with guns come out of the truck, you know they're already dead. Then the man who protects the VIP says, "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He gets out to get the animal that killed his 3 companions. He is snapped into an almost comic-clich√© mode. Then, for no apparent reason, to disregard logic, convention, and common sense, the stupid ass becomes a truck! Many that happened during the movie didn't make sense. Transparent action deviated me from the movie as well as bad camera work, and things that just let you down: "Wow, it's incredibly cheesy." Shiri Appleby rescued the movie of 1 because she gave the movie the one element that always made viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeals.
