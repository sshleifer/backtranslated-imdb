Well ... overall, this movie was almost worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that was ultimately more of a comedy. I rented this movie just last night when my friends and I were watching a terrifying movie. This was definitely not what we were looking for, but it made us happy for humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially that Tracy girl when she got up in the room, and told the clown to leave. They show virtually no emotion and it is just as obvious that they are acting. And even when the clown looked through that black box of paper and grabbed Mark, he didn't even seem scared, even though the clown grabbed him and attacked him. And seriously, do you just JOGGING if you're pursued? I'll sprint for my life! (Although anyone can probably surpass that clown, because he is like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects aren't that big, like when the clown cuts off Susan's head in the bush, then when he puts her head in board throw room with Denise and Tracy when Denise throws the head over again. Just as in the previous man's comments, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I don't even see why it's even included in the movie. So what was this movie made in 2003? The music made it sound like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Doesn't seem to be really professional. Half the time, it looks as if the camera can't even be quiet if it's supposed to be. Overall, I must say I enjoyed the movie. However, I would not recommend it, but if you are trying to do something that scares you, but if you are looking for something to make fun or laugh, I can definitely recommend it.
