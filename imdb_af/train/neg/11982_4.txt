In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (such as Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) supervised their marriage, Anita Page (like Helen) and Norman Foster (like John). Before the celebration, Mrs. Dressler the government of her small town bank to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings a lot of bank closure, and financial uncertainty. Banker Foster can survive, due to Mother Dressler's wise planning. But, Mrs. Moran is worried about her fortune and demands a full withdrawal. Other customers of Warren Bank hear Moran's rant, and start questioning their own solvency. Soon the family is in a financial crisis. <br /> <br /> Dressler's great critical and financial film strip "Emma" was released early in the year and MGM wanted to get a new Dressler movie as soon as possible. as possible. Dressler's 1931 hits, "Reducing" and "Politics" still make a lot of money; and Dressler became 1932's US # 1 Box Office Star, according to industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated the Dressler's status, but the production seems uncharacteristically untidy and rushed. The role play is good, taking into account. Some more care in direction and editing, and some repetitions, would have helped ?? apparently they needed it in the theaters for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
