That's a good thing. The score brought Marlon Brando as a farewell show, because I hate to think he's on Free Money. Not what his fans should remember him. <br /> <br /> Brando in his last years looks more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of movie Welles did to find financing for his own work. Brando is the head of a local prison, which is usually the largest employer in the area, when located in a small rural environment. It gives the one in charge a lot of complaints. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he has one weakness he welcomes, his two twin bimbos, otherwise known as daughters. Even when they conceive simultaneously with some losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Dad. <br /> <br /> Not to fear, because Brando wants to give them work in jail where they work. under circumstances not much better than the prisoners have. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train going through the location, and each often carries used money burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> While Free Money has a few moments of humor, it's mostly among the talents of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the team worked with someone who was very much ahead of the greatest American actor of the last century. If it wasn't for Brando's presence and it was about 40 years earlier, Free Money would play the driving force in red-state America where the population could see them being satirized. <br /> <br /> A weak effort is being made to satirize them.
