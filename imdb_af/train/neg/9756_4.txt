Despite the (English) title, it seems to do little with Devils and much more with a power hungry ruler looking for the Philospher's Stone and wants to make gold from lead (and virgin's blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little trouble killing people when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood. He is actually eaten by his lady love and an alchemist that he is employed and it is more greed and madness that apparently is his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least exciting, like a young and mature man trying to beat each other with big sticks, and the movie has at least a good look at it, but otherwise there is little recommendation. Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of, and most unusual, for a Molina / Naschy movie, not really unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
