Spike lee must be one of the most overstated directors I've ever seen. He's the critic's treasure because he apparently makes movies with a "message" or he's just as embarrassed in his approach that criticizes what is being poured out on Hollywood movies. Eat its good just to be different. <br /> <br /> Summer Sam doesn't even do well. The cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone, and so is the story. The plot is very much like "Do the right thing". The depiction of "Guidos" or for the PC set of Italian Americans (of which I am one) is straight from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of an Italian Italian man who chooses a battle with a much larger African-American is much, much more credible than the cartoonish, broad Italian caricatures shown here. The John Leguizamo character is a possible exception. <br /> Is there anyone who saw this movie that couldn't figure out how to finish it? As soon as Richie came into the movie, I could see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach, I could see him being accused of being the killer. This character has had the most integrity in the whole movie, so of course, Lee will show what happens to people protruding in a crowd (which has a white beard click!) <br /> <br /> Please, please give Spike Lee a lifetime fit to all the basketball games he wants. So, maybe he'll enjoy himself too much to pick up a movie camera long ago and we won't have to subject himself to his self-interest and further I won't have to see critics (some of them I respect) ohhh and ahhhh ' an emperor without clothes.
