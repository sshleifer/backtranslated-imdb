There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not recognize this movie. It is consistent as one of the worst movies of all time. The play is horrible, the script is missing and the director himself does not seem to know how to take this film. A girlfriend movie, an action / comedy, mystery. Looks halfway through, he gives up and is just next to the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated artists. It's a pity they wasted their time and gifts, which makes this mess of a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita before embarking on them threw out their craft on the Hollywood circuit for years. Mr. Morita was already a star in his own right, since the mid-1960s since the death of cult TV and movie classics as "Happy Days" and the cunning but pleasant "Mr. T and Tina." And won the hearts of America with its roles in the powerful movie, Midway, The Karate Kid, and a host of others. Mr. Leno can be seen on TV shows dating from the mid 70's. And was a top performer in the comedy clubs of America. He can be seen in many TV spots and in large films. It's a pity they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
