You Lou's film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on the opposite sides of the conflict after an accidental encounter. <br /> <br /> I agree with the reviewer of Paris. The film replaces a complicated, semi-historical plot for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shift does not matter, as it seems completely unjustified and useless. Usually I don't give dark movies, but the lack of light, the cluttered shaky camera recording and the generally bad movie techniques really make it a hard movie to watch and stay interested. I also agree with the Georgia viewer that this movie has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography, but I don't think it helps the movie. The background of the film is one of the most beautiful events of the 20th century, and I do not believe you can do it right by modifying it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. The excessive melodramatic moments do not add to its visibility. <br /> <br /> The actors are all suitable for melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an extremely limited play, as she spends the whole movie doing what she likes best in all her movies. However, she adds at least a variety of this role to chain smuggling and takes part in the worst love story since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disappointing movie, especially as it comes from Suzhou He's director. 10/02
