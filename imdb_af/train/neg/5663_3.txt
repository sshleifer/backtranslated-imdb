This is for the Zatoichi movies as the Star Trek movies went to Star Trek, except that each of the originals in this case was more entertaining and interesting than this great, shiny repetition, and also made better, if matter is more important as surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought it was good but empty; Since then I thought his style was inappropriate and its content was inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the character in a larger, slender production had sounded good, but there was nothing but the hope of earning money; It's just a show that mostly doesn't take up the character of the character's world and fails to use the character where he hasn't already been (the actor wasn't at its best). I was hoping to see Ichi at a late stage of life, in a story that would see him gracefully and make a conclusion from his experience; it just repeats bits of the other movies, with more sex and sfx violence. Not the same experience.
