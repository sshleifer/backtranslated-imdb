Usually not the quality I expected from Morris (likes Brass Eye and Blue Jam). It's much like a not so bad student video. As far as I am concerned, this is why in all cases it has become a BAFTA ??? Morris makes a great deal of his work (Nathan Barley), a rare mediocrity (Ayn Rand), and with this piece blows the back of the talented and tells us his rain! <br /> <br /> I just hope he has chosen a topic I would like to tackle (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he will not hook up and waste the opportunity to make a statement over the danger of mainstream ignorance and opinion on these emotional and heavily strained phenomena.
