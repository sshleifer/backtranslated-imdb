It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the advertised movie on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, passed 10 minutes, then 30 minutes and I didn't even laugh. The fact is that the movie ended and I didn't even get to laugh. PLEASE, somebody tickles me, I've lost 90 minutes for nothing.
