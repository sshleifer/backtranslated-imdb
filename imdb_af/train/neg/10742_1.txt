I tried not to put this bomb too long ago. What a disaster. The acting was horrible. There were some totally pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a main balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the reaction of the actors just didn't come true. A modern rework of the Hitchcock original "lifeboat". I think Hictcock would turn his circles into his grave. Of what I could suffer, nothing is compelling in this. movie.it boasts some semi big names, but they have no trouble in their characters. But you know, to be fair, it really wasn't anyone's fault. I mean, it's pretty sure that the writing had blown up in the first blast. . LOL.it is possibly this thing eventually improving as it goes. But for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days finding out. So if you don't have at least a three day weekend on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
