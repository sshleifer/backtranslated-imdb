The issue is the best part of the movie, but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I expected a "true story" movie to be tied only to the home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips linked to pathetic and unrelated butchery scenes. The video screens have had numerous rewind situations that are likely to be used to extend the length of the function rather than effects. I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited until it was over, just as it ended up better, but low and saw it just got worse. If I could mark it lower, it would have been negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.
