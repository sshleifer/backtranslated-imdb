What?! ?? Why do people say it's "mind blowing?" Just face it is the end of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world ended! Not to mention the character 9 was an idiot all the time he killed everyone. I was right all the time, if he sacrificed 9, it wouldn't have happened. People who give up live for a stupid cause and for what? To make it rain? I admit the movie has the parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But many of them were clich√©s one by one. And did anyone else feel that it was much like "Lord of the Rings"? Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and frankly asking yourself, it's good to have only four guys in the world. its useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thank you! How are robots in any way creative against people! It's done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, going to watch a movie worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, it was good movies!
