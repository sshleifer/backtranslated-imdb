<br /> <br /> Attack of the killer Tomatoes are a "parody" of bad monster movies that are ultimately worse than the movies it spoils. The (very little) story tells of tomatoes rebelling against those who treat them badly. Basically, they spin and growl (yes, they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. The actors are no names that have never made movies, so there will be no point in mentioning them. There is a man appointed by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black man who is tired and a girl and a guy diving. Anyway, there is another woman spying on the first man working for the government. if it doesn't make you much sense, you understand. This movie would never have been very good in the first place, but it even has the pleasure of laughing at stupid attacks. The movie is terribly cheezy, which, though the whole point is, really hurts a (reasonably) entertaining movie. At one point, a giant root tomato "chips" on an uncontrolled wood screw with wheels on it! Maybe I would have recommended the movie if it had nice camp value, but even this horrible movie is missing. 10/02
