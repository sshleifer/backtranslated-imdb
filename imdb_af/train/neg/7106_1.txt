I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and just saw a handful of them (and not one of the "Halloween" or "Friday the Thirteenth") - but I can't appreciate a scary horror movie as result of gore. And I'm pretty sure it's not scary. <br /> <br /> What is so haunting about a plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all his appearances there are far-reaching shots, so there is no surprise in any of these films. (Not that a skull in itself is so scary, but ...) <br /> <br /> The plot relates to Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who looks at a Donna Reed -sos (Peggey Webber, who ever delivers one of the worst appearances) who begins to see the skull and hear the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? Ooh !!!! Wonder who did this! <br /> <br /> It's the same old plot about a rich boy trying to make and / or manage their wife. If you want to see a well-done version of these things, try "Returning Fortune". And VAT, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the "Gumby" card, but it makes it look good. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, Mr. Von Bulow himself paraphrase: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
