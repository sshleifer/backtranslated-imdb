Quite average, even according to Monogram standards, this riddle (a remake of The Sphinx) has a strange plot that is not unraveled much effectively. You will see it after about ten minutes. The two leaders have had a nice quiet dialogue from the start, but John Hamilton is hopelessly sowing like the villain (perfectly cast Lionel Atwill emerged) and Warren Hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying. However, it is worth seeing through the unparalleled Mantan Moreland through the memorable Mantan Moreland as attorney Nicodemus, who gets the best of the defender during a hilarious courtroom appearance. You must hand it over to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; He wasn't much of a director, but he would always get a routine programmer with a few goofy vaudeville.
