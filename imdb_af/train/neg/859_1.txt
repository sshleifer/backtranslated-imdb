I recently caught this stink bomb from a movie on a cable channel and reminded me how terribly I thought it was in 1980 when it was first released. Many judges out there are not old enough to remember the enormous hype surrounding this movie and the battle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The very popular novel had legions of fans who were keen to see a supposed "master" director, put this multi-layered supernatural story on display. "Salem's Lot" was destroyed in the late 1970s as a TV mini series led by Tobe Hooper (he from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre celebrity). He is badly treated and has the biggest villain of the book in a "Chiller Theater" Vampire with no real threat, thus destroying the whole premise. Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick's stature will succeed where Hooper failed "It didn't happen. <br /> <br /> Sure, this movie looks great and has a great opening time, but after that little achievement it's already downhill. Jack Nicholson can't be anything but Jack Nicholson. is always crazy and has nothing to do with it.I don't mind that many judges here think he is all in this vowel, the "Here's Johnny!" despite ... he is just awful in this movie Scatman Crothers's character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, but Kubrick killed him in one of the lamb's "shocking" drums ever placed on film. heard in the theater I this time during the last 45 minutes of this miserable movie has repeatedly seen. Those who stayed were ... many left. King's books never really translate into movies, as so many of the stories are internal to his characters, and often metaphysics. Kubrick grasped the tension between the living and the dead in favor of the style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we do not really care what happens to anyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is still stinky and why so many think it is an abomination masterpiece outside of me.
