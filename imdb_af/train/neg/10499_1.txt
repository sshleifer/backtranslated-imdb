OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, resting in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was "The Crocodile Hunter" TV show with bad acting, bad scripts and bad directing between Steve we are learning or learning about animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was broken, it was almost non-existent. Casting was terrible. The acting was not even the elementary school activities. The direction must also be incorrect. If you can't get a half-way performance from your actors, no matter how bad the writing is, you shouldn't be so good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never seen this movie. Of course I watched it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son.) While with friends who insisted on seeing it instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminatory, likes the movie, but he has never asked to see it again. If you want good memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I wouldn't be remembered for this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie!
