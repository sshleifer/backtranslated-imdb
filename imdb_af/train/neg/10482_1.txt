One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How do you define the worst? I would have preferred both eyeballs to run out and then be forced to tap dance on them, if ever again this greasy drink is seen. One way or another, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay sellers, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a rogue and messy farce who so forced to defend it. How Elvis Presley Enterprises can allow the rights of the actual Elvis songs to be used in a movie with a central premise that seems to be: "The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead one" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and it does take a bit of work - is the mutilated script: In 1958, Elvis quoted / spoken his words and songs in the 1970s! Worst special effect? That Oscar goes to the morning, which has decided that Elvis's tomb, possibly the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world, looks like a pyramid with a gold record on top and somewhere in the middle of " a park is located. Perhaps this film's biggest audience is Elvis fans. However, the turbulent stupidity (Nixon did give Elvis a DEA weapon, not FBI testimonials ... and I could go on) and actually undergone conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this silly movie. It's really a horrible, horrible movie.
