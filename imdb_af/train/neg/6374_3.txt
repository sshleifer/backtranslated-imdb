This movie was initially a small thing. I usually like Gina Phillips, but the one I have to say was a bad choice, just as she did the movie Ring Around the Rosie, that one not her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She crept me completely and in the end it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) coming to her twin sister funeral. She stays with a home owned by her sister and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is a child who sacrifices her relationships to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she cannot die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, she tries. Ravens has a strange part in it. When the relationships go to sleep, the Ravens eat organs so they can't go to bed. But they do it. Actually it's all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried, but not dead, b / c they should be forever so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If not, sorry. Love you.
