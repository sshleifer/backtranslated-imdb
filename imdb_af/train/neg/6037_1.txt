Moron and girlfriend are doing some ritual to raise the dead, trying to prove that the dead cannot be restored. Not surprisingly, they revive a dead soul that begins to chop them with an ax and the next day some college-aged people tell the story about a campfire. The man with the ax comes up and begins to get hold of the idiots to tell the story. The group calls on the police, the policeman sees blood being flushed and thinks it is a mountain lion (!) And shortly afterwards it is associated with some deformed killers who may be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moronic is a small flattering movie that has been filmed in broad daylight, but with several characters wearing flashlights and talking as if it were midnight and wishing to send a signal flame to attract attention. One man has a gun in one hand and dots in the other, but doesn't bother to load. After last loading it has several opportunities to shoot the killer, but it doesn't bother, because it will end the movie. too early. Then he throws the gun away! Also detrimental to characters who have no emotion and do not look at the slightest worry after their friends are cut into pieces and lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car inflated at the end was clear) a model car) and terrible dialogue and some very ugly female nudity help. And in the end, it tries to get away with its incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college older people telling the firefight stories at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Then the killer gets in the right place in the last scene. Again. <br /> <br /> Moderate of it is good, just good for some unintentional laugh. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
