This movie made the TV stinky about it. Although it started with great intentions, with beautiful sets and authentic props and costumes. The movie quickly scared off in the nose-cheese dialogue and chased TV dramatic melodramatic acting. The characters were so juicy that at times I thought they were about to fall into a beautiful pool of goo, and the action was so complicated and poorly cut that the soldiers were just standing around take turns shooting at each other. The Germans were so unrealistically portrayed that it was painful to watch. The only thing the German officials were talking about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. However, this DVD has an excellent extra feature, covering letters from WWI lines, which makes this rental not a total waste of time.
