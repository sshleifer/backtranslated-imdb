It was a popular movie, probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an undercover character that closed all the speakers. Funny thing is, you probably can't make a movie with this title if you have replaced someone but "white" than anything else would be considered racist by the PC police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who seems to be so good if it is no better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as his lead counterpart Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had lots of funny lines that provided lots of humor. The bad part of the movie - which doesn't bother many people - is the extreme curse here and the scam of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There aren't really clean, nice people in this movie. For that reason, I can't honestly recommend the movie, at least not to friends or those who offend a lot of curse
