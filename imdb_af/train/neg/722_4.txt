One scene shows the mentality of "Terminator Woman" very well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp. Karen walks over an armed guard, pointing his gun at her, but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, picks up the gun and runs away! Then, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another family member, you know you shouldn't expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble are getting a spectacular scam early, and the movie might have been better if it focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they are divorced, and the movie slows down to a crawl, and even with the occasional battle scene to educate things, it's not excited. The final has Trimble, who is fighting Qissi in a cave, and Sheperd goes womano-a-womano against beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the battles are confused in a way that breaks their flow and reduces their value. On the plus side, kudos to the costume department to give Karen the opportunity to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (* 1/2)
