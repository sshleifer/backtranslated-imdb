In fact, there is a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there is a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera. And suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> First of all, when you are making a movie, decide if it's a thrill or drama! As a drama, the movie is visible. Parents divorce and argue as in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet that completely destroys the whole movie! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN-like movie, and instead I watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 just for good playing parents and descent dialogues. Regarding the shots with Jake, they ignore them.
