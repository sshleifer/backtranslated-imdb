As someone who has lived through and still remembers the decade for the decade, if the 70's were half this funny and (semi) normal, they would have been so much better. Current children in that era did nothing to as bright and normal as these children did. The country's youth were still under the influence of the hippies and drug culture all the uprising of the 60's who sustained it, especially in the behavioral department, the bleeding, the smugness, the self-righteousness, the childhood, the unreasonability of them. None of the characters show any of those. <br /> <br /> Someone compared to "Happy Days," and I can see why: They were both sitcoms taking place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast, and they both just offer surface, click depictions of the actual periods, not even close to its full extent, but only the obvious things - the fashions, toys, music, contraptions, etc. And that's it. For those who are too young to remember, or not born, I trust, the 70's were not so, just like the "Happy Days" were like the '50's, like' M * A * S * H * 'Life has not been accurately portrayed on a US military medical base during the Korean War, etc.
