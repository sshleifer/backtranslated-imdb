I missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie, but don't think to watch it from the beginning, would have made any difference. I found the movie very boring and was disappointed with the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in excellent roles, but they all disappointed here because of a very poor writing. "Friendly Solomon's Mines" ... the very short part of the movie in the "mines" was about so exciting that it was dry paint and I doubt even a preschooler would be spelled by the fight of the soldiers ". The whole movie was reminiscent of a cheap US TV show - Give me Indiana Jones any day!
