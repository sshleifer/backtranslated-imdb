Townies is the funniest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). It seems confused in what it wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough to watch. It has scenes from a man doing "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I think, oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it jumps without warning in a drama about a missing girl, a delayed (mentally disabled) woman and a confident mother. Then, in the ANY good part of the movie, it looks like it's a sitcom without the laughing tracks. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TOWNIE, which is so lonely, he finds comfort in a rotting look. It was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling. The rest was a means of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there, is a kind of DOCUMENT at the end of Wayne's film director, Toby (the star) in public. It made me sick. Although Killer Nerd and Bride or Killer Nerd (two other films by Wayne) are not the best, at least they are thought enough, so you can stay to the end of the credit course. I even like Killer Nerd, it has some good lines I still use to this day. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like overseas movies, and if you want to see your feet, just rest where they are, you won't like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (off ****) <br /> <br />
