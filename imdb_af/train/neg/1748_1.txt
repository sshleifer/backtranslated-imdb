Don't waste your time with this movie. It's a total thunder in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors. The movie isn't right on Paresh Rawal, which is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also an emerging star, has done a bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God for having a nice face, otherwise he would win Razzie Awards in India if there were such Bollywood awards. Asrani is a great talent, but overdoing her bit as before. <br /> <br /> Screenplay, which was not a rip-off of the Boeing Boeing of 1965, was rather poorly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood just can't make something original. In addition, they don't even know how to copy well. The jokes in the movie were so exaggerated, it became painful to sit down by them. Priyadarshan can be a star in the south, but he's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. The sound editing is incredibly crappy. I can go on about this, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be scandalous to make such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people love this movie. What's wrong with you guys? That's why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood is making more movies every year than Hollywood, but most of the movies are unheard of abroad, due to movies like this. I'm an Indian and I'm totally disgraceful of Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just great. They are world class movies that are timeless ... under the best of this decade. However, Garam Masala may be one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 out of 10.
