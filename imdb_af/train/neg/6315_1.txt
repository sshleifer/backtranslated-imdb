This sleek, sexy movie is a must-see. Only on many views can one really understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally, I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no subject untouched, style of narration. The introduction immediately grabs you and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the film. He offers wonderful insight into the world of train bars and enables the audience to make truly 'internal' horror with these movie shows. The script itself keeps the movie together wonderfully. Not only for children, but the elderly will have a better understanding of the train and the modern understanding they have on the sexual experience. Before its time and groundbreaking work in cinematography, it certainly defines the word 'masterpiece'.
