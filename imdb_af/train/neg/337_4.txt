Well, that's what to say. THE GOLDEN CHILD falls into the "so bad, it's good" category. Eddie Murphy has some funny (and sometimes very annoying lines), but you're still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than its role as the villain Sardo Numspa. (What's the name of this name?). <br /> <br /> Who should watch the GOLDEN CHILD ... hard to say, but my best guess is people who keep shameful movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and even more embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
