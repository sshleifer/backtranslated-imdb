The plot is credible but banal, that is, beautiful and neglected woman of rich and powerful man has a flirt with a psychotic famine, and then try to cover it if the psycho silences and chants her. But what comes out of it is unwavering. Despite the resources available to the ordinary couple who have money and influence, it seems that our privileged hero and heroine have at their disposal only one house, lawyer and local police (who say they can do nothing) while they are and irregularity wrestles with terror. They have no private security staff (just a fine security system they do not abuse), domestic or ground staff, drivers, etc. Not even the funds to hire private casualty nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries, leave husband and wife alone and vulnerable in their home. Our heroine is portrayed as the brain of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, acts in the most unlikely and irrational way. The production is an insult to viewers wasting their time with this drive and crime because they wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what do they think?). And scan on Live TV for insulting the intelligence of his audience for this indifferent offer.
