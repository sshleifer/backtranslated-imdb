If you want to laugh, rent Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he can't defend himself, so Scott takes him in. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott like to wrestle, and Scott tells Billy that he is, among other things, "hurting last night". <br /> <br /> Wonderful catches like "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut the sh! T" will make you laugh for hours. The indigenous American guys who are supposed to play Mexican gangsters are also on top of that. As they say, it's a party time now. Ba-ba-baa ba baba. I can keep on forever but just watch this movie and laugh at your $$. It was so funny I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
