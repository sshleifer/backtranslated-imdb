This movie is absolutely horrible, but it can sometimes be hilarious, though this humor is completely unintentional. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous outside. I don't even think a 2-year-old would be convinced by the ridiculous idiot that the filmmakers are trying to snap into a story together. But on the positive side, some of the terribly unpleasant plots offer a lot of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has hidden a huge missile in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even nicer), but I'll save you. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally ridiculous. Most of the children's roles are kind of cute, but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is pretty much everywhere. The adults do not take their roles seriously, but this is largely a good thing. If they wanted to be credible, the movie would have been even worse. It's hard to think. <br /> <br /> Once you are beyond the overall madness of the movie, there are actually some notable moments of almost non-crappiness. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the daughter is surprisingly hilarious, though it is an annoying lapse when they are caught by the police. The butler character, while very small, is a ray of sunlight that almost never penetrates the gloom. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie actually caused me pain. Nevertheless, there were some redeeming parts that made it almost vigilant without starting to bloom internally. Judging by its good parts alone, the movie would be about a 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the movie barely earns a 1. So, I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> It's pretty generous, I would say.
