Outrageously trashy karate / horror thriller with lots of graphic violence and unreliable nudity, and a thorough bias and bizarre "plot". It is lowbrow and low-grade entertainment that will only appeal to viewers with particularly kinky taste, but it is very cheerful and I have to admit that I was not really bored when I watched it .... (* 1/2 )
