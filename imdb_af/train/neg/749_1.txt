Nu Image, UFO and others are producing films for the SCI FI channel that comes with about $ 2 million in budget. Some features have extensive effects, others have recognizable works and two other features - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million, but it is painfully clear that it was probably manufactured for $ 750,000 if it is not much less than that. Few sets are used, a number of scenes are shot at green screen and most effects are incomplete and amateur. <br /> <br /> It is painful to watch. Not so much, because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misleading, but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and, with high expectations for this movie, despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced joined the legions of PT's Barnum.
