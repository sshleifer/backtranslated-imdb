It's not horror, because the first part was: "campy" light and humorous entertainment. As in so many prosecutions, the action immediately begins with no explanations. But there are boobs, so I don't complain. And real boobs that are. If I understand correctly, it is quite rare among the teenage girls in the US of A. What keep me in mind that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> It can't be. thought without the first movie, so I compare it to that. Again, there are too small clothes (mainly pants) and funny hair, it is not difficult to know which decade this film is made. There are many strange characters again, this time even more visible "pathological". Especially the camp staff. It's like a mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they should be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. Actually, this movie doesn't have much in common with the first part, and it's anyway worse than that.
