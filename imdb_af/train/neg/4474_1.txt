waste of my life .... the director must be ashamed. why people feel they should make worthless movies will never make sense. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the movie, because I was ashamed to watch such poor actors. Hopefully the man who played Heath never worked again. In addition, I hope the director will never make another film, and his payroll will be taken back. {.02 out of 10}
