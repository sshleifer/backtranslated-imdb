Man o man! What a piece of crunchy movie-up! But it is a guilty pleasure of my childhood, though I hate to admit it. They have shown this movie all the time on my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino), we got this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they actually showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I loved and loved the young Brooke Shields and loved her crazy adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda appears, a lot of dialogue that is so bad is good and a good Carole King song played on the final credits. Perhaps you should be stoned to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in the Grand Canyon!
