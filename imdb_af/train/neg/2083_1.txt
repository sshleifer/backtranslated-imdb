At what point is a good movie going bad? When does a movie of "viewable" go to "where is the & ^ @ _ + #! * Switch"? Thanks for DVDs, like this one, that can be borrowed from the library - for free! Similarly, thank you for the "fast forward" switch on the DVD player. I feel sorry for the people who were muted at the cash register. <br /> <br /> At one point (I forgot exactly because now it's all just a blur), our "hero", Luke Wilson, starts running through; I think he's looking for a taxi. That was when I gave up, realizing I can't care if he got his ride or ran through a truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting when Luke Wilson got out of the dumpster, hairdryer in the hand, and first met the "heroine", Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the purse-criminal criminal escaping helplessly from the fire far, far above the room Luke and Uma. That was the last time the movie was funny, and when was that scene? Ten minutes in the movie? <br /> <br /> Every time the movie tried to get funny, it couldn't. Each time the movie approached 'excitement', it celebrated and went in the opposite direction. When a musical score could possibly have been helped to push life out of this dullard, the soundtrack remained empty and quiet. <br /> <br /> The sex scene was not needed and was over. the damage to sets and props is unnecessary and childish. When Uma gets into the mad ex-girlfriend, I felt like I was watching the "40-year-old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; then I realized that there was no return because I kept the 40-year-old Virgin and Pulp Fiction thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson's sidekick, Rainn Wilson (also seen in the sadness "The Last Mimzy") adds nothing but insult to injury in this horrible movie. Rainn Wilson, the King of Television Survival, must stay with that awful medium. Hey, Rainn Wilson! Solve only photos only! Every time Uma's rival, Anna Faris, got on the screen, I expected Jason or Freddy or a scarecrow monster to jump out of the background. Once you see Anna Faris in 'Scary Movie', it's all you ever see, no matter what the movie is, regardless of the medium. The character Wanda Sykes played was just awful and so out of place in this movie.
