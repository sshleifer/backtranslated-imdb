Well, I've also read all the amazing reviews and commented on how this movie can make the best picture Oscar, so I saw it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from members of the US Army that served in Iraq, how unlikely the events of this movie are. They reflected my own thoughts; Like the movie I played, I thought to myself, "WHAT? There is no way this will happen." 2) There is very little that actually happens in terms of plot. A new bomb planner is being shown to replace a dead person (a death not really explained). The new man gets an adrenaline rush from his job. His attitude puts others at risk. IT'S THIS! 3) This movie is nowhere near as stressed as claimed. If you want tension, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try Go Go The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket that he was a movie that he was very proud of and one he regarded as some of his best work, and what he was still upset about, was largely ignored in the aftermath of the exaggerated Apocalypse Now, or an old black and white classic Zinc The Bismark, which is especially for an English film, is incredibly heartbreaking. Don't waste your time on Hurt Locker.
