There is no longer what I can say that this movie was terrible. The whole of Chineseness was awakened in your being because the ancestors were a hard sell. But told the audience that every Chinese know Chinese history, without even reading it, just nice. It's like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino etc. Etc. It's just not credible. <br /> <br /> The story is flat. It talked about Shin who is from a monastery in China - which is later identified by Bejing. However, the early series of the film shows the map that focuses on Mongolia. I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas such as Mongolia for its own. But it is a clear nation and even labels "Mongolia" on the map. Did Disney Studios 5th Grade Geography Fail? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is at best superficial, yet she feels somehow in him. Her training is just cheesy. And, let's get started: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry over. The Taekwondo action was in many cases played over and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The evil eyes thing was cheesy. However, the finished end would be the only descendant. They had to leave the evil eyes ending in it. But somehow, evil is overcome. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, not worth the dog's time in the movie. Brenda Song should continue with another studio. "F"
