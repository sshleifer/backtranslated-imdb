The point of departure is incredible and the acting, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming ... but this movie is almost inevitable. The music sounds like it comes from some kind of free online site and the lyrics as if it was written with a rhyme dictionary open on the lap. Most of the song is off-key. I think they filmed accapella with the song and put the music down there ... The dialogue is really stupid and foolish. The movie works best when it is actually talking about real estate, but unfortunately it often comes in stupid farcic subtypes. I watched my phone after my first twenty minutes and after 40 wondered, "when will it ever end."
