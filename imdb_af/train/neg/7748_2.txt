This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies playing on it. I really don't know if this movie could be originally mentioned. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island is fairly well known. What was it, oh yes, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying a rather horrific death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looks very much like ketchup. At the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and went around to eat the tourists, or the people who were invited to the island to see the tigers' first hand. Again, sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth that crawled on its front paws and killed the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrank and passed through the cuff. The finest death I saw on TV. <br /> <br /> The play is extremely cheesy, the special effects are terrible. The CG tigers can almost pass clay models, and even the sounds are down. For example, when one of the colleagues tries to escape, he uses an ax to break a door, the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were quite funny.
