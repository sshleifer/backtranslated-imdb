This movie offers nothing to anyone. It doesn't succeed at any level. The acting is horrible, dull, long-winded dribbling. Of course, by the length of the end, they tried to make sex scene shocking, but eventually only became a parody of what the movie was looking for. Full rubbish, I can't believe what a laughable movie was. <br /> <br /> And I'm very sure that Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie, as she would be her intrusion, a raging NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult is going to stick to this movie, as the film spells out like an uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teenagers. Pathetic.
