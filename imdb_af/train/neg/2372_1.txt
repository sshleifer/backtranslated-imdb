Incredibly stupid, redundant and humiliating closing of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems like director Rachel Talalay deliberately wanted to change West Craven's first assumption into one big bad and tasteless joke. It's not just the worst entry into the "Elm Street" saga; It is also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it is offensive to the genre of the genre! The story is stupid, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all dark and? most of all ?? The special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The rows in which Freddy Krueger killed his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to be disturbed if a Jabber Freddy Breckin Meyer changed into a video game character and placed him around the walls of a house? The story brings us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. You'd think he'd call it in one of his previous adventures, but no ?? There is only one teenage survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get in touch with his lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so terrible is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe boy is introduced as the premier character, but then suddenly he dies and the plot continues on two adults! How about it: Freddy Krueger, who has spent five full films, except teenagers, is finally beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! Similar ruins the whole essence, or not? As far as I am concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly over-rated range, but so far even the worst entries have had at least some redeeming elements. However, "Freddy's Dead" is simply unbearable and no one has to waste his / her precious time to see it.
