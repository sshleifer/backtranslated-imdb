I had no idea what the movie was about, before I saw it because Tashan only had teasers while it was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said "This is the director debate of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screens for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the movie play him as a child in his flashback ". <br /> <br /> After I looked at it, I understood why they were not a proper trailer, because there was nothing to show in the movie. The story was dumb and even a 10-year-old child could find a better story line. There was almost no action and the camera shook every possible angle. There is and it's hard to figure out who is killing. The action was also awkward and unrealistic, eg. One man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> As I watched Tashan, it reminded me of three movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English, like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageous ridiculous jokes that aren't even a bill. <br /> <br /> I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money goes. Anyway, if you do not like Dhoom 2, then there is absolutely no chance that you will love Tashan. The race was warm on heels and it is a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece in good places, but what is their use in a garbage film? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English could not save this awkward rescue.
