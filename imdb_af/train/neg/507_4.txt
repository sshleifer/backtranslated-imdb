Unlike my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something in any movie I see. Yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wood and the opening sequence is very misleading to what drips with all the lascivious female lesbian vampires. Something must be lost in the translation of the word "Bloodsucker" of the Italian into the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a Gothic Vampire story and then change their minds, but could not afford to give their dramatic opening sequence, so cut it anyway on the film. <br /> <br /> Made this movie In 1975, it was recently released on DVD and with its own stage trolley which in some ways is more daring than in the movie! Now everyone who buys this movie is probably reading all his synopsis and knowing what to expect. in the middle of 1970. I bought it because I was attracted to Christa Nelli (mostly credited as "Krista Nell"). The absence of a role player I find most frustrating in many of these Euroslea films from the 60's and 70's. I hoped Imdb would show the movie of characters as they hear their names in the movie, but without a roll list it is very difficult to link it to the actor concerned. I think Krista Nell has played "Cora", but under the massive hairstyle, costume and makeup it is hard to discern her. <br /> <br /> There is usually a two-dimensional depiction of the actors of their parts and no one really stands out. Perhaps something has been lost in the dubbing process. What were the positive points? the music was atmospheric and of course if you are in beautiful lesbian soft porn, there is. The external sites used were good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on his island. It appears to be in Ireland (North or Republic?) In 1902, so all sports era costumes. Some of the scenes I found unintentionally funny, especially those sex scenes! Anyway, a pleasant skirt. I classified it 4/10.
