Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad writing, bad direction, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea? This movie is trying to be western fragrant, it's not. It is trying hard to be cruel, it's not. It tries to present a new look to an old genre, don't do it. The actors try the best there, and my heart goes out to them. But with such foolish material to work with, it's hard to make anything shine. For me, it has all the appearance of a "fresh outta movie school set fire to the world" first attempt. Freshmen filmmakers often bite off what they or their budget can chew. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, reconsider what is possible and work next time within their limited budget.
