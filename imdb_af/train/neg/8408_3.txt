Wow, it's very unusual in one sense: usually the first movie in a long series of pursuers is the best of the bunch. People are surprised if a successor is actually better. With Tarzan I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six that consisted of my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I'd like to follow the successive times, but I'm going through this turkey through several characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - A lot of action on many wild animals on the screen, even if it's just stock images. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name them, and you see several of the different strains of all kinds, including pygmies (called gnomes in the film.) Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I can't beat the realism, because they hadn't been in the movies long ago. They do the best they can so you talk to actors talking fake backgrounds. Weissmuller, however, did many action scenes and was in good shape. He and O'Sullivan make a well-built beautiful couple, if ever there was one in the Golden Years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film has historical value (with so many persecutors), showing how Tarzan got Jane and his beginnings of the English language. <br /> <br /> The BAD - From the moment Jane Parker is taken by Tarzan almost every scene, Maureen O'Sullivan is hysterical, screaming and screaming at the scene. It's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the movie. Fortunately, she calmed down in the successors, but not in this movie. The movie also makes no favorites for "The Great White Hunter" image such as C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Jane's dad, and Neil Hamilton. As "Harry Holt", the safari guide, shoots in every animal within sight, or the animals threaten or not. These people are dead-happy, especially Smith. On another note, it's too bad There's nothing to explain how Tarzan was primarily in the jungle. There is no history of him here or footage of his growing up. He's just there when Jane and the group come to Africa at some point.
