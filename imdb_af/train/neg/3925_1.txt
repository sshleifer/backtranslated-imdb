I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. It had an X rating for a short scene with oral sex, but played in mainstream theaters (it was an art movie). It's probably the first movie to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned before, Detmers is very nice with a good body, but she also delivered a very good performance. Pitzalis was (generously) very poor. It's no wonder he never made a movie. Yet, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicitly rather short), it is a slow, dull, boring story that makes me boring. The good acting Detmers only helped to some point. I usually look at my watch and wait patiently to end it. If it didn't have the order, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. Moderate and slow. You can hit this one.
