I'm so torn on DARK ENGEL. The film seems to be a "loving" tribute to the greatest game ever lived - but there is so little real "content" that the film itself is virtually useless. I can't really see what the motivation or "point" of this movie is - as there is very little biographical information in the story - so those who don't know much about Bettie will no longer know after watching DARK. or ... <br /> <br /> The movie basically chronicles the past few years of Betty's career in slavery modeling. Almost the whole movie consists of "re-enactments" of some of Bettie's more famous photo shoots and loops. These re-enactments literally take 75% of the films, and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person. The film briefly touches on her short-lived, legitimate acting, and her subsequent decision to leave and become religious - but it is all in hand to show long and protracted re-enactment scenes. ... <br /> <br /> DARK ENGEL is not a horrible movie - there's nothing wrong with it. The other problem is that the actress playing Bettie just really looks like one in further shots. It's a no-go thing. The other thing that irritates me is that although Bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the movie was a short segment shot in the zoo during the final credits. The film itself is, of course, extremely low-budget, but does what it can set and costume way within its limits - so there is nothing from me. The acting is fairly woody and unmistakable for everyone involved. In fact, the most memorable thing about the whole movie for me, was noticed during the final credits that the actor who played Irving Klaw's real name is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - look at the roll list. Can't say I'm not recommending this one too high unless you're a real Bettyfile full-time and who has anything to do with her. And if you are so bad then you should look for treatment anyway ... 4/10
