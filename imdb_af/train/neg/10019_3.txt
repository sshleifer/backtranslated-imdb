Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Ankshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Hijack in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good Banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Not one good reason not to see this movie. <br /> <br /> So I thought ........ Didn't these people make JJJ ... <br /> <br /> Why o Why did I forget it. <br /> <br /> For all the criticism, the first half of the movie isn't that bad. <br /> <br /> There are some plot and YOU FEEL A MIXTURE OF IRRITATION MIXED WITH EXCITEMENT THAT I WAS AS A WITNESS RITCHIE FILE AS LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is in a very skinny model sweet. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar just like he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but a little funny, YOU EXPLAIN THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT TIME. <br /> <br /> Saif is later ala Main Khiladi .. again. <br /> <br /> There are occasional laughs and some chuckles, and some goosebumps during the kareena-saif love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike). <br /> <br /> BUT THIS HALF OF PROMISES MORE THAN THIS LIFE ..... <<br /> <br /> There was almost a courage when the interval didn't just come because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things that came. <br /> <br /> INSIDE WE ARE TREATED TO KEEP LITTLE TORTURE, WHICH IS INSPIRED TO MAKE WORDS. <br /> <br /> Suddenly sifting like a cartoon ... <br /> <br /> ONLY THE SEXY KAREENA LUIS ANOREXIES, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR IS TAP AND IT'S FACE FOR BIG FOR IT BODY (only girls can see it and let other parents know that the second last floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOROR AND HIS SIDE PIECES ARE BECOME YOU. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who endures the madness to some extent, but even after a while he becomes unbearable. . <br /> <br /> ONLY YOU ARE SUBJECT TO AN ABSURDITY TO THE OTHER. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT ?? !!! WHEN? !!! WHERE? !!! What did I do to defend it ... <br /> <br /> A collective thriller went before the songs in the second half, which was commonplace without the film about it. <br /> <br /> Can't relieve the trauma anymore. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM STATE OF AS A BUZZ WHAT YOU CAN FAIL ALSO GO TO CLOSE UP. GO TO A MAIN ROOF AND THEN WHAT RAPIDLY ACCEPT IN A NEXT MIGRAINE .. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + S Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> + / - s what, when, how, who too much confusion. (A book needed to fill it). <br /> <br /> + whole second half (requires many pages to complete). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (I try to avoid the 1s and 2s, doesn't look extreme either, but don't make a mistake. This movie is inflexible, no matter how decent the first half is).
