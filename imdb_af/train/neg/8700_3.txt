I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons didn't try to make a serious horror, or even an action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is flat and stupid from start to finish. Even the humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Definitely a high watermark in the 'So Bad it's Good' genre. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, it's for you.
