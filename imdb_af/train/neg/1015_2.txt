Pathetic ... worse than a bad-made-for-TV movie. I can't believe Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character speaks constantly and says "pussy" when he refers to the NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calls women "pussy" is just uncomfortable ... What was hell thinking about the people behind this movie? Too many plot holes to think, combined with the horror acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I hired this flop with low expectations .... but. Well, it really sucked.
