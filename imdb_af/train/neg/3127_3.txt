An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbles on an old, 40 foot mummy, well preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep it a secret and call in a Jewish translator to help determine its history. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in those days. To save his son from a devastating flood predicted to kill everything, he mumbles his son and has been evaluating him for several years with several servants - planning to wake him up for years. In our present, the fallen angels still run the earth and the mummy is raised and a ritual is expected to occur. Most of the movie is slow, dealing with many biblical shit and a few lazy, air-fights. The mummy looks decent but is not shown nearly enough. It had to deal with it more, but it dragged so much. Don't bother.
