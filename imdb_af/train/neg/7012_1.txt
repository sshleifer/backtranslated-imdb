My friend and I saw this movie as a "Premiere Surprise" that we bought at the ticket for a movie preview before it was opened in Denmark. We sat through the 1st hour or so and then we left! The point of the movie was simply to portray the era (and club 54), but this did so at the time of character development, of which there was nothing and a plot of which there was little. <br /> <br /> Rare I was so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> However, the music was good. So if you want to hear good music and get a solution from the 70ies mood, I think that's right. But don't expect to get a plot of credible characters. <br /> <br />
