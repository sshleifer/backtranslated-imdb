I don't see what everyone likes this movie. The setup was too long and talky, and when it was finished, the main character was as flat and opaque as he was in the first scene. After the film, Cusack finally came into the memorable hotel room, I had to wonder, what was going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged. The answer: not much, just John Cusack has a long, protracted, spiritual outline. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the Cusack character had more depth. . Perhaps if his freak-out was a thorough rework of his everyday life. . . Perhaps if the movie either developed better its half-baked themes on loss and belief or did not tackle it in the first place. . . Maybe if the movie made a choice to be psychological horror or excitement frosting and embracing one of these styles altogether. . . I do not know. All I know is that I've seen this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us liked it very much. <br /> <br /> Apart from the disturbing episode on the hotel list, the disturbing crazy lady with the hammer, and the stupid-it-wash funny crib keeper in the air channel, all three of them no more than five minutes of screen time is not, this film was a drill. By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here to much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
