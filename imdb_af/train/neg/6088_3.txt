Why do I watch movies like this? - Unlike I have some strange deceived masochistic belief that someday I will find a true gemstone among all these shrubs, I can't think of a good reason. This movie was foam from start to finish, but semi-hilarious foam. Unlike in a bad Italian copied movie, you can find heated exchanges of surreal mutilated English like this one between an honest military type and the sinister head of a secret X file like an organization that has hidden the truth: <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Silence is best for us until we can prove that the UFOs have no obstruction. <br /> <br /> Military Type: Anyway, I find your interference insulting. <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Who needs to set up his will. <br /> <br /> I turn the DVD (you know what I mean), a good half-dozen times, and I can't make those lines yet meaning anything meaningful. My other faveline was: <br /> <br /> "We can be very difficult for those who violate our interests." <br /> <br /> It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this dull movie clutter for me were the overall alternate play of the photographer character at the beginning. Along with the worst hairstyle, ALSO in the history of everything, the man just ran around, like a stunned fish in a bad wig until kidnapped and forced to watch a piece of plexiglass through some strangers. The strangers are not most effectively seen as a POV shot - holding-camera with a fish-eye lens - kind of spooky for the first time, but what is used over and over has lost its power (coincidence, if that One point of the shot is that the strangers are always going back for some reason. <br /> <br /> The film was in England. This means that the Spanish Italian set designers put a few British number plates on a few English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero's press card. And it was about it. No other attempt to make it look like the UK. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When the Foley artists did not observe the characters, they were no longer on gravel, but were on the lawn so their feet kept on making "crunch crunch"! sounds. Other than that, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove those UFOs have no golden motives ...
