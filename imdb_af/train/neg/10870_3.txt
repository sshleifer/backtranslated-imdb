Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to New York to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to chaperone him and ensure he didn't fall with gold diggers. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) comes to the scene to disapprove of the women. We follow the story as the girls are offered more money to show up in a show instead of their accompanying role they agreed to perform for the 3 months that the bill is in New York, while Bill with Cleo and meet another woman. In the end, love in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story is riddled with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not so good either. He's nice enough, but really comes alive when he plays the drums or trombones. There is a very annoying character playing a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the movie is not boring.
