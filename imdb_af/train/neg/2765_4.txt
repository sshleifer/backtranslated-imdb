How this movie was made with a so-called $ 70 million budget and without being completely reconsidered is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurism. Characters say things that no real man will ever say and virtually never respond to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The actions of the leaders are good, as the writing is such a dud ... but several role players really play the production. The hero's hair probably had his own credit, it was so strange. Grab ... not to mention that it has given one of the better performances in the photo. Finally, for a movie about L.A. which is besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a pity! If you see it, your thoughts will be constantly racing, inventing ways you could use the SFX screens and building a better movie around them. Unfortunately, it wouldn't have taken much.
