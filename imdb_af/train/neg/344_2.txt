Let me really be clear about this movie. I didn't watch this movie because I saw the plot, I see it for the bad sex scene. It is said, this movie is so god damned, horrible, I am turning out of sheer joy to see a divine body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and eradicate my eyeball for the disaster of a plot. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie has cut me. You see a woman painting something on the waterfront, in sheer bliss and calm, then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she can paint next to her. When they both finished, they showed each other what they did ... and the woman painted a vineyard when she came inside the lake. What kind of screwdriver director would make this kind of mistake? And in another scene, Traci is going to kill her teacher's lover by defeating him with the cane, and then she swims away and none of the town's police once suspected her. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY WAS NOT WEIGHTED. Her fingerprints are all about the goddamn boat !! Then it gets the worst, when Mandy is around, there is the "cold" sound effect played like a cat that fits in the fitness. This is also a pity. Rosanna Arquette's is in this movie. I really feel sorry that she must die in this super low budget soft porn brain. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to die in this movie. All in all, 2/10.
