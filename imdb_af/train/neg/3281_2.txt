I suspect the movie is going to be bad. I'm a Duke's fan from behind. Have three years of TV show on DVD. Well, I'm right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the hunting pictures were good. But to sum it up, the movie was a darkened version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was just awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Arrows also have to roll into their graves. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money. If you're an old proven Dukes fan like me and my three kids, you'll be very disappointed.
