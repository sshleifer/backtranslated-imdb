My friends can usually make many hopeless movies, but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end. It was just as boring and original. Not even the "hot" girls who played in this movie could make me look. Everything was just predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The acting was sometimes good ..... but more times bad. The most annoying character in the whole movie you just wanted to kill must be the best characters best friend. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to break my screen. (You know what thick ugly kid I'm talking to) <br /> <br /> The plot has been done so many times before I think they should be sued by other movie companies. OK, that's a good idea, but it's all this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can only be watched if you want to save yourself any abuse of your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
