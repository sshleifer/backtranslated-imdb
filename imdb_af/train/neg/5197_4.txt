Weaker entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Simple funny banter and antics, but not much plot. Barrymore gets something to do like the inspector, disguised Drummond, Algy and Tenny on a wild goose hunt (mostly in circles, perhaps the budget was stricter than usual) to save poor Phyllis, who is being held by people who want Drummond to its punishment lies. For those who score, in this one, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about the baby's baptism. It's nice to see Algy and Tenny dressed as fisherman to mix at The Angler's Rest, but little of it rises above stupid.
