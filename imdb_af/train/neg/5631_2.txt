The photography on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen died. I think I saw half of the movie. Yet it was poorly manufactured and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I was hoping for a riddle or a thrill, but didn't get enough to see the first few frames. I hired the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad because he wasted his talent. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande has long done enough movies to develop a big movie. She is attractive and can develop into an actor, but she has taken on too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they do not have chemistry on the screen. Their relationships do not seem credible. I don't understand why the other characters were even imported into the plot.
