For me, each piece of art is judged according to these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting plays. The long close ups indicate a function that the viewer can fill out. Due to shortcomings, the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes he seems to have nothing to say. This film acts as an introvert. If you didn't read the synopsis, you can't see that it was the suicide (and the unanswered question why?) That changed Anna's life view and made her suspicious. "Why don't you talk to me?" asked Sebastiaan. Anna didn't answer, she just started looking at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastian: What does this movie have to say? What is meant by this movie? The answer to me: It shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. Motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest are: skins, residences, landscapes. Beautiful and artistic, but meaningless without the use of 'instructions for use'. In my opinion, this film was made for fellow artists, not for the general viewer.
