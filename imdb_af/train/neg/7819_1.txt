... That would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK, maybe tied to Boogeyman. Terrible, really terrible. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and they didn't meet them! I honestly can't think of one good thing. so here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. THE WORK 2. THE PLOT 3. The CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE Finally .... 6. THE PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions. Did they make a movie of 2:32 hours and realized they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman together in a scene and had to be forced to settle for 3 minutes or did they actually think no one would notice that the main hero and villain has less screen time than the Superman's son and the killer he kills? !! <br /> <br /> Was half the budget spent persuading Kevin Spacey to do this? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask, "What is the F *** you want us to do? He's a F *** ing stranger! doesn't Jack know about his anatomy! "? <br /> <br /> What happened in the 5 year Superman was gone to make technology run 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where the people who wrote good reviews visit the same movie? <br /> <br /> And finally, why? Just why? <br /> <br /> VAT, for those who wonder how Superman can pick up a whole continent of creepy, I think I figured it out ... <br /> <br /> ... since superman is unaffected through the kryptonite until he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. Therefore, the continent thing is only he who suppresses his fear of shiny green rock. <br /> <br /> either it or the authors are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think it was a pretty clear mistake.
