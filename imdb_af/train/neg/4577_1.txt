I strongly agree with some of the other critics of this movie. I found it incredibly stupid (at best) and straightforwardly misleading, misinformed and harmful (in the worst case). Like others, I saw this movie as a terrible mix of "real" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, I was especially argued by Candace Pert's contributions. Truly, I was not a fan of her before this movie, but her discourse on cell consciousness was one of the best examples of using a term ("consciousness") that most people have predictable meaning and use in such a twisted way rather than obscure it. It is an old Orwellian mind-f ** k that the master himself described so well in his beautiful essay "Politics and the English Language." To refer to "consciousness" in this way - indeed, to refer to this film as "science-based" (that is, its clear intention) - is to use language in the same way in the service of Stalin when he uses his slaves. states "democratic republics" and Hitler when he called his party a "socialist workers' movement". <br /> <br /> I'm not really understanding quantum physics. I know enough of knowing that it will really understand that it will take considerable study. Oh, but we Americans like "direct relief" and that is what this error of a movie is trying to achieve. When asked questions, it will be one thing, but it clearly tries to ask and answer them, which no movie could possibly do simply because we are far from the answers. <br /> Incidentally, this film ethically indemnifies the unification of several "expert commentators" with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention JZ. Knight, who often speaks in her "Ramtha" voice. (I am always amazed at these 10,000-year-old Atlantean superman's concepts of 21st century concepts and terminology. But again, this film claims that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he can exist now and tomorrow. And first, how does his financial advice get so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of good and bad advice, so that's my fault , not Ramthas.) <br /> <br /> What a mess.
