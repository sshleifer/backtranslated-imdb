I knew this movie had to be so bad, it was funny, so I packed it with expectation. I just found it so bad it was murderous. The clumsy theme song is funny about 10 seconds, until you realize there's nothing smart about it, except its deliberately annoying quality. To see things getting split with tomatoes, they grow to be about 30 seconds old. There is nothing fancy or funny about the movie, except for the point of departure. It may support a 3-4 minute comedy sketch, but it's just not a movie by any imagination.
