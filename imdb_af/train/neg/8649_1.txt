This movie fails at every level miserably. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and send them in a hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we are happy, they will all be shot and killed and we will never have to waste our time again. Did I mention that I've never been so bitter about a movie in my life? My god, I can't think of anything I've ever seen that was so bad. I'd rather be watching Ishtar 25 times than putting 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a movie. If I ever meet someone involved in this movie, I will spit in their face and then beat senselessly. It's me two cents.
