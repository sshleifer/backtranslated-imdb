I saw how this movie didn't really expect much, I got it in a pack of 5 movies, and it was all pretty awful in their own way for a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I'm right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and some stretch it). Interesting points, the occasional video camera view is a fine touch, the drummer is much like a drummer, ie banned annoying and this is actually the problem that it is just as boring. In what I can only assume was an attempt to build up tension, a lot of nothing happens and when it does its totally boring thing (I quickly took my thumb forward button, ready to push for most of the movie, but given it a turn) and seriously the lead singer of the band who looks nice, they do not call half how beautiful he is a hell, I thought he looked a bit like a meerkat, and it did I didn't even mention the killer, I'm not even going to go into it, it's just not worth explaining. Anyway, as far as I am concerned, Star and London are the only reason to see it and with the exception of London (which was actually quite funny), it wasn't because of their acting talent, I certainly have a lot of seen worse, but I also saw much better. Best to avoid unless you are bored to dry paint.
