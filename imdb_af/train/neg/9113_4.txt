They had such a potential for this movie and they are completely flat. In the first cruel intentions, we wonder what motivated the main characters to become the way they are and act. There is almost NO character development whatsoever in this prequel. This is actually a very sad story, but this film did nothing to me. It was as if they left out good writing instead of unnecessary f-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn't explain anything. The writing was just awful. Another thing that bothered me was that they used to lease 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Like the down boy or the kissing scene, and a few others I can't remember. I was not impressed by Robin's acting, but Amy did a good job. It's about the only thing that reconciled this movie.
