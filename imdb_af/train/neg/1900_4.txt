Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master loom forced back into the game when his younger brother faces death because he did not fill an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The job involves lifting 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will do his punishment. Raines quickly puts together a crew he can trust and puts the task in hand. But the police are on him and some of the cars on the list are not easy. It seems like an almost impossible job to complete. <br /> <br /> It has become quite a movie, gone in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan & Timothy Olyphant. All of whom deserve better. Enough acting horsepower to continue a Porsche 998 Turbo. Trouble is, it's a case of too many cars that overflow the car park, many characters, not enough. From there we are no doubt that it is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, a bonkers script with loud sounds and lashes of cheese, scattergun editing, and subtly directed by Dominic Sena. This is essentially a large budget copy of H.B. Halicki's 1974 Indie movie of the same name, with the prospect of potential for an adrenaline-powered car-based movie. Potential unfortunately never realized. There are one or two high impact moments, but surely, but nice. But if you forgive the pun, the movie never comes out of the first gear, it is more content to work with its team characters who are trying to make the drilling plan (Scott Rosenberg) work. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get something out there (the cars are bait on the eye), as well as fans of unintended comedy films (see Ecclestone's snymaker moment). But no, it's really pretty poor, all told. 10/04
