Despite some exciting (and daring) rows, NBTN never gets going. There are explosive boats, hat murders, mass murderers, pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery / horror screens, but they are caught with long periods of pure exposition. Everyone in the movie looks bored. This is a pity because many of the sequels would be considered daring if they were filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to this the "improper" Brit characters and you feel like you've been driving in Sherlock. Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very common. There are many opportunities for beautiful shots of the countryside, or complex shots of someone who is drawn into a big bonfire, but the whole thing is unattractive and boring. Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans.
