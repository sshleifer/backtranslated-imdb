Poor Wants will roll over in his grave if he could make this the perfect German TV adaptation of his classic play. Obviously very little money was spent on it. A rider, a cat walker and some randomly placed columns run like a set. The film was unclear in English, with the English voice actors muttering their lines from time to time. The whole production had an incredibly dark and urgent feeling. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it deservedly earned. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this movie was never in the first place.
