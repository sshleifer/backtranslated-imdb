It's a low movie. It has no real plot. We are never subject to motivation except wealth. The characters are among the worst actors ever put on film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three older people. Why do they do what they do; to bring fear into other members of the group? I do not know. There is a little bit of a mishap rolling around in the halls and everyone looks scared about it. Do this something? I do not know. There is a little nudity for their own sake. I'm always surprised to see it in movies this guy. Things actually actually settled in this regard. Anyway, the people run around like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; no resources; No nothing. There are about five stupid climax in the movie. Who are these people and there is a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I challenge someone to tell them with any confidence. What a mess.
