There is nothing I hate more than a divine pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails to inspire every white middle class guy to make a movie about why they can't be laid. I don't really give inexperience and low-budget productions, but when writing is so obvious, it's burnt my potatoes. The money put into it can have gone to a real struggling filmmaker, who actually has a chance like John Gulager. Looking at Project Greenlight, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary fighting the system. Anyone can grab a camera and make a chat that can't really say anything. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can't be quick enough. Check out a real first time purchase by Desperado or looking for friends with benefits. Thanks and good day.
