I saw it on the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheap prodigy - nothing wrong with it, but you should do it with a little sex or gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers to quote her. I think so. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the spacecraft comes down, is hilarious - you can picture all the crew hands shaking it around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish the people who made it good - at least it's not pretentious.
