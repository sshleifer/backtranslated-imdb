When I was younger, I kept this show, but now ... BLANK !!! This show is juicy, poorly written, and rarely funny. The three leaders were all good actors and funny men (Saget's uprising was much better than the stuff gained from this show, as Coulier was better off, and Stamos was better than average actor). After a while Stamos wanted to leave the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who can make him guilty?). The show eventually canceled when many of the actors claimed more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that make me crazy: <br /> <br /> 1. The catches-How many times can one person with fatigue catches set up as "how rude" , "you got it", "nerd bomb", "cut out" and "grace" in a 24 hour period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. The author bought and clicked an oreo cookie. There is good cleft writing and badly cleaved writing. Full House wrote poorly clicked. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men live together in San Francisco - Enough said. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic things. Too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy kids-The girls have all the latest mall fashions and you can see trendy poster artist posters what they would be in. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I will hardly call it a classic. I have nothing to say about the people involved, as I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just as sweet, I couldn't stand it for a while.
