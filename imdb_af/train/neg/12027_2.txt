I saw this movie in the middle of the night as I flipped through the channels and there was nothing else to watch. It's one of those movies where you stop seeing what it is - just a minute! - But realize after twenty minutes or so that you can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere so bad is good and so bad is it, well, just BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing it's both! Great mid-night fare, even if it's just for the fantastic tennis drag. Don't even bother asking yourself why no one can say Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic is not applicable.
