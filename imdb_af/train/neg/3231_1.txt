This movie looks like many people have said it is one of the most cruel of all time. Having just seen it, I can say that it doesn't meet the demands. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is indeed dementia. But overall, the performance was not worthy at all. Even the final scene (the eyeball thing) is not really so nasty. I expected something insane, but it was of lower quality than gore on films like the ultra low budget Violent Sh! T is offered. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed as there is no story at all (though most people know it). Gore fans will be disappointed since, unlike faith, the blood and intestines here are few and far between. Not to mention the actress who plays the victim can be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it just sucks everything out. Avoid it.
