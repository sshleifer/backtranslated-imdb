Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be made in movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is devastated in adjusting book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who accidentally kills an old "gypsy" woman. In court, with the help of the judge and local police chief, he goes away, although the accident is similar to his debt, as he does not pay attention while driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman puts a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Although the movie is mostly kept at the book and ended your typical King, the play has been put and forced. We went from one scene to the next, without much of anything in between, like reading in a play. King himself made a cameo in the film (like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that writers should just stay that way: writers. Leave the play to actors. Not that anyone in this movie was so good. I saw the main characters in movies where they were much better.
