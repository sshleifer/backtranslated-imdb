I have read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can't say I found much to recommend it. The Leonard Cohen soundtrack is not only excessively heavy-handed, but out of the ordinary. The movie looks really good, but something has to happen, because it works, and nothing does: a flowing plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, thematic theme. It just knocks it together. Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has a few moments of real wonder and is a movie I will see sooner. For a brilliant recognition of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is much better than "McCabe."
