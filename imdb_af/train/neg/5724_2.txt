I agree with the last reviewer that this movie has acted terribly. Yes, there were many gore and some nudity. But it is overshadowed by a slow moving, meaningless plot and stupid end. Where is it supposed to be filmed: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing it. A technical annoyance with the DVD is that if you quit the Spanish subtitles, come back to some scenes and then go back to the main menu and turn it off again. Also, don't waste your time on the deleted scenes because there is no sound and it looks like tourist recordings.
