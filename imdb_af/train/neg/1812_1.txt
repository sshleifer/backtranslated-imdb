Go immediately and rent this movie. It will be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and covered in dust. No one will have touched it in years. It can even be a $ .50 special! It's worth $ 10, I swear! Buy it! There are not as many movies as they can be compared - the celluloid version of the goo that forms a trash after a few years. Yes, I gave it a '1' but it does earn much less. 1-10 scales are not designed with things like this in mind.
