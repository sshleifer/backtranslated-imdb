Otto Preminger leads this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widowed father David Niven holiday in southern France with mischievous Mylène Demongeot. Things are good until family friend Deborah Kerr pops up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too difficult to resist. It's good with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as he finished all the women in his past ... including Demongeot). If his second banana seems to be in Niven's life, Seberg is just revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and combines smart black and white with sunny colors. The cinematography by Georges Perinal is stunning. The movie features some of Preminger's heavy-handed direction, though he rarely allows any close-ups, making it difficult to determine what the actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it is full of acidic dialogue and funny scenes (mostly with a heartfelt Demongot). Seberg frees herself pretty well, but Niven is at least pleasant ... and he sees no chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really missed out on that casting. It's a role that looks like someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg's fan and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco, who plays for herself, sings the title song in a night school in Paris. The big titles are regular Bass Bass by Preminger.
