The only thing that prevented this movie from being a total disaster was some interesting stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death through the comic is a little bit of a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which delivers death by cartoon. Yet it is well handled, especially to bleed the ink and sow the color. <br /> <br /> There's another good scene with a demonic motorcycle. <br /> <br /> That said, I was glad I bought the DVD cheaply from a store that went out of business because it was pretty terrible. At the same time I bought 'Soul Survivors' and both movies were equally annoying with the constant realization that you were watching a dream. But, where "Soul Survivors" have nothing to do with it or make sense, it has at least some attractive notes referred to above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD can go to the DVD. the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens, which is the only way to see it. The dissertation between the creative gore moments is quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
