Released in 1965, but clearly shot years earlier, it is an undisputed little crime melodrama with some improper sexual excitement. As usual for grindhouse flicks of the era, there is a fair amount of dressing and dressing for no reason supplemented by lousy music, annoying narration and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene is the impeccable groundwork, as we chop back and forth between characters to prevent them from actually seeing their lines. All we get is reaction shots to the character of the off-screen character! 50s beautiful Misty Ayers strips several times before her cut off French panties before the action begins. She is constantly accompanied by what appears to be stock music from romantic to west to mother play, randomly mixed to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever captured on movies. See how he scratches it! See how he beats the game! Will he breathe or will he be caught by Apaches? Only time will tell!! The film tells the bad story of how Sally is helped in a whorehouse, falls for a dope and can't escape. For some reason we are treated to some of the bored and boring hookers who are ever connected to film, who literally do or knit their nails rather than entertain the client. A nice lame comedy (boozy lady accidentally drinks milk! Has it!) And the silent movie show doesn't help. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, even on the Something Weird Video Marquee. It really is more of a movie greed for those interested in the history of the theater - very bad theater.
