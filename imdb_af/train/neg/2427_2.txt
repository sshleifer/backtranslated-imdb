Don't get me wrong, I love action and revenge flasks. I have seen many of them since I was a child, including Dolph Lundgren's latest "The Mechanik" which is very good. And Tony Scott definitely knows how to use a camera and can even be a genius shooting and processing movie. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more so with "Domino"), Scott points out that instead of using his cinematic "genius" skills intelligently, he uses it to speak and to compensate for a lack of content that his material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is close to 2 hours and half when it should be at least one hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott shot and edited this movie also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit down through his movie because she is constantly moving and flashing camera, is it Really a torture to the eye and let you leave or switch off the scene after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes The MPAA and studios have dubious attitudes to ratings, violence, and making PG-13 movies. I also find suspicious that a $ 70m movie is being made from a B-movie with a finger-cut character, putting a bomb in a man's ass and blowing a man's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a girl who is not even dead! Then figure out why a studio will succeed in writing better because of the language or violence ... So said ...
