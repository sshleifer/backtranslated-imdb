Sorry. Someone should say it. It's really a dull movie. Maybe worthy, but it's dull. I almost cried when I looked at it. The play is pretty bad, the story is laid out and predictable, the score and camera work are completely standard and unspeakable. This is one of those movies you shouldn't hate (because it's about disabled people) but hate it. I suspect almost everyone does. Interestingly, critics have been so nice to this movie. I think they may not be objective either. It's made to win prizes - which I remember doing well. But it wasn't interesting or entertaining. I didn't see the scene, so it can't be compared.
