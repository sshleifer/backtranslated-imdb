2002's undeservedly popular "I love the 80's" is a dirty, idiotic, offensive and straight-outly pop culture mess of a performance that was the first in a long series of horrible television programming that ultimately spelled the end of VH1. At one time, the only true music-oriented channel was on TV! I practically lived on VH1 until spring or winter, I forgot which one now, from 2002, when garbage like this started for absolutely no reason whatsoever. From pure morbid curiosity (I think that's what you would call it). I decided I would go ahead and give it a glimpse - see the first night anyway, even if the ads look like a complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed about it, because my expectations were clearly below basement. The emphasis of this show I found within the first 5 minutes was less every year of the 1980s and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (what I expected to see), but rather an impromptu platform For a whole lot of really god-fearing no-name comedians to show what they think is more than likely, they are comic skills. * Roll eyes ... * more than a lack of it when you ask me! It is pretty easy to see now why no one ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show, as they are so terribly careless and pathetic in their attempts at so-called "humor" that I swear to my guts can feel knot with every ravenous one-man who shot them apart! Altogether, I have no problem saying that "I love the 80's" was / is the trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons I almost never look at VH1 again.
