Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about Tainos as if they were very influential in the dynamics of contemporary Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spaniards were and she knows it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen and looks like an average light-skinned black chick (with an obvious black father, cousin and aunt) who pretends to truly recognize the true being of what they make the modern Puerto Ricans, but hardly mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken, influenced food and music. She is so typical and I have lost a lot of respect for her and will support nothing else. Since she wants to dance over her African nest, she has to take no more roles in blackness (ie Lackawanna Blues). Next time we can find a fun Black Latina (thanks Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> For the Puerto Rican who said they were black and not black. ...Thank you. Our "blacks" certainly have nothing in common with "you", so there is no lost love. But since you are probably in the state and benefit from the Civil Rights Movement, we would like you to refuse a decent human treatment that you received, thanks to the blood, sweat and tears from the back of the blacks have nothing to share with you. <br /> <br /> If I am right, Puerto Ricans has a terrible media image, but our blacks do not spend to discourage you because we know the media likes the lows and behavior of everyone to use. minorities to maintain bad generalizations. But you've obviously fed in the hype that you're somehow white or better ... you're not. Also, you somehow feel compelled to believe that the black culture is BET ... again, you're wrong and have to take a holiday out of the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. I trust, not one of the blacks wants to claim your "culture".
