This show was bad. The writing sucked, the dialogue sucked. The man Craig played could not get out of a paper bag. As it was on Thursday night, it was definitely great to watch with some beer. Cool music, bad acting, poor writing, everything came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a drama / unintentional comedy. I don't care what happened to one of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, as they couldn't reveal who was the victim, they had to write the dialogue about it, which was terrible. I mean, the promise at the funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that have taken place in the present are absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> So let's review. Everything happens at the present time sucked. The flashback screens, just the writing, dialogue and Craig's play sucked. However, the music definitely did.
