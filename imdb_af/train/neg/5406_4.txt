Of course, my first views on this movie were bad. I expected a horrible, crazy acting, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effect movie. What I got was actually not that bad. The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the movie itself very interesting, and the writing was pretty good and decent. The acting wasn't that bad, and overall I enjoyed this movie. It's still a very bad movie, but it's not totally worthless, as I thought it would be, and I'm happy to know that this movie has managed to dare me, even if it wasn't not good. Generally this is a movie that should be avoided, but it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.
