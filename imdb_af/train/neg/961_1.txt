Silly, simplistically and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN OF NEWS) goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> This short (just over sixty minutes) story is not so much inspired by the classic Spaghetti Westerns as this is a rip-off of Sam Raimi's THE QUICK & THE DEAD (his dedicated tribute to the Spaghetti Westerns). In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the turbulent sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, in her hands, when she was a couple, placed the fate of her father (a short como of Gary Sinise); she accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by the cute Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the turbulent Mr. Tojo (played with a minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was only one, placed the fate of her father in her hands; She released her foot from the clutch, and dear old father was pulled and quilted by a semi-truck. The only significant difference, despite the institutions, is the fact that Tojo sadistically defends Saki with Klappie? Well, I won't spoil it if you decide to look at it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki ?? a light imitation of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name? drive in town? basically, there is a car shop and a tavern along a US military base, so I think it's enough for a village ?? damaged by Tojo, the local crimal word with a ridiculously high price for reasons never explained or explored. Saki takes her own self as a bounty hunter, takes Saki the local armed men in shooting, whose choreography more than a similar deal to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, by the end of the film, Saki has endured her fair amount of torture in the hands of the bad guys, but she rises to the opportunity ?? On her knees, in a ludicrous attempt at a surprise that ends? and overthrow all her enemies with a rocket. <br /> <br /> Don't ask where she gets the rocket charger. Just look for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The picture quality is average for the DVD release. There is a grainy quality for several rows, but it is not a bad transfer at all. The sound quality sometimes leaves little to the imagination, but it is not a bad transfer again. <br /> <br /> It's rather a bad movie.
