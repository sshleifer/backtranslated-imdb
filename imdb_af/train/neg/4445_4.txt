Serum is about a crazy doctor who gets a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases by the power of the mind. Instead, it creates a kind of monster to eat human flesh and brain. The crazy doc creates some zombies out of carcasses and has problems. There is a very long lead in all the action with lots of scenes to make you familiar with the characters. The mad doctor's cousin comes in a car accident and the mad doctor tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. It's a class C movie with OK acting, but a few issues that regulate and some continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can move forward through the slow parts and enjoy the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.
