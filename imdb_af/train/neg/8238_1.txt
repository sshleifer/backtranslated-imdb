This film was positively the worst movie I ever watched. I couldn't sit through the whole thing. I also think the writer should have some strange fetishes for women who pick and scratch. I mean what it's all about! I can't believe it's even made and disgusting that I paid a Â£ 4 rental. The quality of both photo and sound is terrible, the acting ... well existed. It was a bad excuse for a movie and the screens of shit, shit and puck were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... avoid at all costs! The girls looked as if they were picked off the street and just got the part because they were willing to take off their tops. While these girls have beautiful bodies, it certainly didn't make up for them to scream terribly. unconvincing and painful to my ears. <br /> <br /> It was like (perhaps worse) as an amateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set, as it looks like it's turning around a car? <br /> <br /> Don't define one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I couldn't find anything positive to say and I would like to think I can save someone else wasting their money as I have.
