I must first watch a movie if I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was offensive to go through. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" moving, how the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and just look innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just terrible. Like the girl who finds the reporter in her friend's apartment and goes from "what are you doing here (with a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, you want to @ # $%! ???" In 1.2 seconds .... Just bad. Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and play with your kids (or dog)!
