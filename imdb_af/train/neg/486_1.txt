This movie was a blow to me. I think little girls should strive to be nothing but swimsuit models, homemakers or mistresses, as it seems to be all they will ever be portrayed. It is really sad to see that an artist's work and life is misinterpreted as unfair. Inevitably (or perhaps expected), Artemisia's entire character and everything she stands for have been reduced to a standard Hollywood female character; a zealous, physically flawless, helpless little creature that shows none of the traits that actually have her place in history that has been mutilated here. Even more slothful was to see that much of the audience was too poorly educated to understand the incredible gap between the film's message and reality. To portray the artist as someone who is in love with her real rapist, has just pissed someone she's actually accused of raping her, even when he is torturing. If the director had nothing more to say she should have refused to base her story on a real person.
