This movie is godly. Not one quality for this movie. You will think the gore will be good, but it sucks badly. The effects are worse and the acting one you can call is the worst I have ever seen. This movie is clearly shot on a camcorder and is probably about $ 500 on a budget. If you want to see a good Zombie movie than to see Dawn of the Dead of the Dead. If you want to see a good cheap shot on the video, it's a better way than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unshakable and useless. You're warned. I have nothing else to say about this silly movie.
