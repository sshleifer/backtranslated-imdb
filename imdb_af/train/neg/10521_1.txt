This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only half an hour, it feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen such a movie movement and so without a purpose. It's also a horror movie that takes a lot of time in the daylight. My friend and I laughed at a crazy amount of time when we were probably scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a horrible movie has been released in so many countries. It cannot be so high in demand. <br /> <br /> The supermodel Nicole Petty should remain modeling, because although she is beautiful, she has lost her accents in this movie so many times, half of her time is British and half the time she is American.
