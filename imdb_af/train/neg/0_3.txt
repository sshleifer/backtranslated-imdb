Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Start with an opening scene that is a great example of absurd comedy. A formal band heard being transformed into an insane, violent gang by the mad chantings of his singers. Unfortunately, it remains absurd all the time without a general narrative that ultimately only makes it. Even those from the era must be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare look easy for a third degree. On a technical level it is better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
