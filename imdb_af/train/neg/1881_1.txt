This movie sucks ass. Something about a heat wave in some European countries, complete trash. There is nothing for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds generation, but that's it. There is a very annoying chick running around with people and really pissing me off. This movie is complete and you should not subject yourself to watching it. I'm sorry this is very boring. I'll rate it zero, but I can't. No body in their right mind should see it. I'm sure you'll regret it completely. How can they think something so bad. Even mystery men were better. Mystery Men. It sucks. The movie was not worth making. waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and I'm very much bored.
