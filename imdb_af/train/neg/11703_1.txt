You will notice that the pharmacist, who appears and speaks in two scenes, is played by Stephen King. "Don't give up your day work" is the standard thing to say, but it's not fair. King gives himself fairly well: he is no worse than any other member of the cast, and better than most. The story, on the other hand, is pure rubbish. Please, don't give up your day work. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many terrible acts - the main actor (the LEADER ACTOR!) is probably the worst - come together in that one movie. Everyone behaves himself, but not in an entertaining way; they can somehow go over the top without giving up or manifesting energy. I blame writer / director Tom Holland. It can't be that ALL actors are really that bad. What is the chance? Of course I have never heard of any of them, but I do not believe I can go into a talent agency and join these very bad artists when I tried: ONE actor, despite my best efforts, will turn out to have talent. So, what's more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes, or wrote a lousy script and did it badly? It will also explain why actors are in direct relationship with their main writing. The more direction an actor has, the worse he acted. ("You want me to bend like a hunchback, talk about the back of my throat, show all my teeth and look bored, all at the same time? Okay ...") <br /> <br /> This Theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland has been unable to write a lousy script together. Several authors here commented that Billy Halleck is not a similar character, but it is a misleading way to put it. He is not a known character. All we find out about him before the supernatural things begin to happen is that he is fat and that everything he can think of is food. ("All I can think is food," he tells us helpfully.) And in the end ... <br /> <br /> (Suck) I suppose I should bring in a spoiler warning ... < br /> <br /> In the end, he gets angry. Why? I can only show. Maybe he's under some spell. Yes, it's probably. By "evil" I may mean "inexplicable" - it is not so bad as a socially unwanted suspension of ordinary middle-psychology. Anyway, his action at the end doesn't make sense, no one's actions make much sense, and that is despite the fact that the characters do little, but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my nominee for hammiest line / delivery: "I don't think you want it. In fact ..." [great dramatic break] "... I don't think you want it not at all. "
