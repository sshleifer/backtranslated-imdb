Having just returned half of the movie in November, I saw that it was on Flix Channel and decided to see it to see the rest of it and to write a new review about it. <br /> <br /> The book on which the movie is based, Hatchet, is OK. However, this is a terrible adjustment to it. <br /> <br /> Terrible (and I mean terribly) acting, bad dialogue and average cinematography make this terrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The movie begins Brian who is the cliché image of a late 80-year-old teenager (with a mole wasting his head on the cheap 80-year-old rock music) and driving his mother in a car for him to fly on a plane to see his estranged dad (his parents are divorced ... now the dramatic pause goes out.) Brian now greeted Mom and dog and went flying to see his dad. The pilot is a thick, ugly, rude man (not so in the book) who after two minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies. In the book it becomes more detailed with the pilot who has more pain and it seems that they were much longer in the air before the pilot had his heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (within two minutes) left empty on fuel (we leave the viewers to assume that he has been there for hours, although the sun has not changed position and the landscape looks exactly the same .) Now he's landed crashed. <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is very different from what it was in the book. In the book he said that his jacket was torn, but in the movie it was completely fine without tears or rips (looks like he just bought them), it never said he had climbed a mountain, saw a wolf and fell asleep there. On the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear (it said a moose but not a bear), it never said he was eating the various mistakes he made, it never called the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows fold it and eat them or that little fish trap he makes (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes), it also says he hurt his ribs from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I don't even think you can call what is portrayed in the movie a tornado. All it was was just a windstorm that had covered several of its well. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this feast was Brian's lame flashbacks (never mentioned in the book), especially Brian's cliché scene. up, cross over to the window and see his dad (with all his stuff packed that can fit perfectly in the back of his truck) and scream "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDD !!!!" (Of course, his father didn't hear him, though he was just outside) and he slid his fist through the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing close to what In the book I said one of the most important things the rescue pilot told Brian when he landed was: "You're the kid they were looking for! They stopped months ago ... but they left that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without advice or therapy) to come back with his family. I think we had to assume they were coming together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then it shows his temporary home (for what looks like the movie for three days, but in the book it was for a few months) and his incubator, still in a tree where he left it (didn't happen in the book either) where he'd carved a message, done so perfectly: "HOME" (where we really had to believe he was ap It is perfect with just that breeding?) <br /> <br /> No quote can pick up this movie better, when Enid of Ghost World said: "It's so bad it's going past, good and back "Perfect description of this movie. <br /> <br /> I won't recommend it to anyone (who hasn't read the book) and is just looking for a movie or I want someone who read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, who have created your imagination as the movie, it is terrible and will bring your mind to the book. <br /> 1/10
