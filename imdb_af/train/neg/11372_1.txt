I've been using IMDb for years and never wanted to get involved in the commentary of movies. This documentary has so many problems I almost know what to say. I'm not a Muslim, and I'm not an Islamic scholar, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided view this documentary predicts. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie starts with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I've seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: What the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslim, but creating a documentary document on all Islam around a small percentage of radical people is incredibly deceptive. It's really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who want to explore more objectively more of the issues presented in this documentary, here are several points that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focus on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the documentary is a dubious one. I watched the documentary as I watched another translation and the differences were striking. I was warned about the translation used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Surrah says unbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I read earlier: "Those who reject the Truth among the people of the book and among the politicians will be in hell fire." The difference is that those who reject the truth are those who know God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but it is not true. Although it is true that many of the Koran and Hadith originated, Islam also acknowledges a concept called 'Urf or' normative behavior. "Obviously, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but" Urf is meant to be "good" behavior, considering an average person right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary provides Shar'ia (Islamic Law) as one united body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. That is simply not true. There are many Islamic law schools and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> The Hadith tradition is similar. There are thousands of Hadith and every law school accepts some and rejects others. Using the Hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which is accurate, real and appropriate, is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotes from the history that suit what you want to say ?? what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists shooting doctors of abortion and so on. I know it's not the same as suicide bomber, just understand that the justice of fundamentalism is probably the problem. If you feel that you have the answer, then everyone else should be wrong. But if you feel you have an answer, you can work with other people's views on politics, religion, God or whatever.
