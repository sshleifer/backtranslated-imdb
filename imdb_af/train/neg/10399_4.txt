One of the big mistakes in this film is that while the mockery of pretentious yuppies is satisfactory, it doesn't realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of one of those who deserve to be mocked. One of the features of these yuppie types is the conceited misconception that they (the yuppies) are the only sophisticated to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of the meal, I find it ironic that only people enjoying this movie enjoy the same excitement in movies as the characters in their choice of dinner. If these pumpy characters were in this movie, a video library at home, I'd bet American Psycho would be one of those movies.
