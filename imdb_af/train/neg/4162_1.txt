If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil movie, just watch it instead of waiting for 2 hours, you'll never come back. I can't believe no one has noticed that this movie is just a cheap knock from RE. First, a "special" commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an AI and holographic projection. And this "hive" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill one group member at a time. There is even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the RE dialogue. In spite of the fact that there are no zombies, the "smoke", the film's nemesis, a kind of biological creature, is a very bucket of color that suggests neutrotic tissue, with many cyborg components, just like a super-mutant of RE. So, a finger from Mr. Richard Taylor to claim any credit for this story. <br /> <br /> Of course, they're not the same movie, but the author got the idea of ​​thinking about Resident Evil. .
