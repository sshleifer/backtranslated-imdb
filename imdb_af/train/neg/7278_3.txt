This scary movie was a bit of a trial to go through. None of the segments is good, but the first one was at least amusing, and the middle one was somewhat imaginative. The last one was just brutal, and after being seated by two poorly comical shorts, the third was a painful one to watch. Even by the low standards of a National Lampoon movie, this one was especially boring and joyful.
