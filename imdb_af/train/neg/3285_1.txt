When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings in more than $ 75 million, it makes incredible sadness about the state of our own society. Or we are too stupid to stay away from this trash, or maybe I don't realize how many people will wear this kind of casual waste. <br /> <br /> Hollywood had no incentive to make it. good movies, because if it falls apart, people will see it anyway, as there is nothing else on the screen. This is it. I walked out despite a free movie pass. The dialogue couldn't be thinner. The stunts could not be over and over again. Maybe this "bigger that big" image calls on Texans, but it didn't touch me or anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" in this career-ending movie, except for Burt Reynolds, says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - Don't make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't even recommend this movie for video, even if you were desperate. It was all about the failure of the public to make enough money after opening the day to look or better than it costs through marketing. They warned in spite of the public. Dumbness is abundant.
