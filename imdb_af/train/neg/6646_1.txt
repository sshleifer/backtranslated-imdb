It's so sad that Roman audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who enjoy this kind of cheap and demonstrative performance, as superficial and brutal as the "Garcea" series or the "Vacanta mare" child's play ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such artisans never suppose to claim their performances as art. Pintilie, who made a very good movie ("Duminicä la ora sase") 40 years ago, followed by another one, nice enough ("Reconstituirea"), tries to explain his film length "artworks" - but unfortunately He masters in a way to limit the level of specific cinematographic expressions. As such, "Niki Ardelean" offers another example of "HOW NOT" - it's about its only merit.
