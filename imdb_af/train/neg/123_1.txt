Oh, brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous movie for about ten years, I can only think of the old Peggy Lee song. <br /> <br /> "Is that all there is?" ... I was just an early teenager when these smoked fish hit the US. I was too young to come to the theater (though I managed to sneak into goodbye Columbus). Then watched a show at a local film museum. Finally I could see this movie, except now I was as old as my parents were when they divorced to see it !! <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie was not condemned to the anonymous sin of the time was due to the invisibility caused by the American release. MILLION people flocked to this stinker and thought they were going to see a sex movie. Instead, they have very close feasts, repulsive Swedes, street interviews in mere shopping malls, asylum political pretentions ... and poor ones who provide simulated sex scenes with giggles, pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, holy grail, historical artifact. Whatever this thing was, torn it, burned it, then threw the ash in a main cupboard! <br /> <br /> Elite esthetics are still scraping for value in its boring pseudo-revolutionary political muscles. But if it wasn't for the censorship, it would be ignored, then forget. <br /> <br /> Instead, the rhythm title "I Am Blank, White" is repeatedly repeated as a title film for porn movies (I'm Curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I'm curious, black - for blazing movies , etc.). and every ten years or so the thing comes out of the dead to be watched by a new generation of suckers who want to see the "naughty sex movie" what r made the film industry's evolution ... "Yeesh, avoid like the plague. Or if you need to see it - rent the video and quickly move on to the "dirty" parts just to get it over with. <br /> <br />
