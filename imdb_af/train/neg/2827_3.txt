The story is initially interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with this is that it deliberately rejects two of Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that many Arab men will be free to roam and catch Blacks easily in West Africa is so credible that whites are looking for slaves in Roots. It is clear that both industries are managed by locals and (d) have much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slaughter trade, Israel is one of the worst offenders according to Amnesty International. So why only show Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obvious prejudice and hatred of the people by a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
