Hmm, Hip Hop music up to a western point. Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to keep up. "The sistahs are in the house" !? French manicured nails on hard drive girls. Microphone packs are clearly visible on Li'l Kim's back. I just can't make the mistake of mistakes made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> The acting is not as bad as I have ever seen. The women did well with poor writing. <br /> <br /> It was strange trial Louis Mandylor speaking in his own accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. The costumes are fabulous even though they are completely wrong. I just can't believe they would hide a wonderful story. I will feel offended to believe that this movie is loaded with such bumpers that it will play well in the city center. <br /> <br />
