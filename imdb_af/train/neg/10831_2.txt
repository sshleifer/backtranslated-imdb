My guess is that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see what it could have been ... a. Frog storms would be creepy? b. can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the C word many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Put my wife on and get her to say the "F" word every 2 seconds. With this I really looked the beginning and the frog stormed. The rest was a relentless, over-long (under-edited), excessive failure. So many of you enjoy it! <br /> <br />
