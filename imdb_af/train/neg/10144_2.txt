As Steven Segal films, this is one bottom of the barrel. His best was just feed for bored teenagers. This one wins the scales and then drops off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double paralyzed. I can't spoil it by telling the end. You already know how all the Steven Segal movies end up if you saw one. Here we go. He is a super-doping government agent who knows too much about getting rid of so they decide to kill him instead of getting his brain dipped until he can't remember. He escapes, of course, is arrested and is by his old general, who needs one man in a million experience to get a stealth plane back to a terrorist gang in the Afghan government by a rogue air force pilot who surprised Verras, Segal trained. All heroes, except Segal's character and his dim girl, die heroically and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in a swell foop or falls. Whatever. Made with some surplus air force and fleet. And many tree trunks. Get some Popeye cartoons instead.
