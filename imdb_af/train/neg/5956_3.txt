Another horrible movie in which a goofball teenager fights a crazy man and his supernatural sidekick who wants to take over? Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. "The brain" has undergone the difficult teenager Jim Majelewski in a treatment, whose leader appears to be a cult leader supported by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I think that as our northern neighbor has achieved everything they have achieved, they are entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But they will probably want to be known to have national health care and everyone. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why don't the people who made this movie?
