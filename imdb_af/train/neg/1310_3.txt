The plot is a man who, one day, lives off a main road in the woods, testifying to a man murdering a child in the forest. The old man's attempts to convince the police that what he saw was not an imagination of his imagination followed softly for digging. However, there is a problem every time the old man leads the police to where the murder takes place, no body can be found. Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue that reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man who lives in a house himself. During the film, I found myself scared twice, when the murdered child suddenly appeared before the old man. The rest of the movie I have to admit didn't involve me; I found the film a bit too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions looked too long for the film. I could feel more of the relationship, ghostly encounters with the child and the old man. Only in the bush at night, unsure of your own thoughts, can lead to some ominous situations, children are always scary like ghosts, see Dark Water.
