When anti-forest jokes are really easy to do, a show like this made it something extra. If it's something extra, the child's versions of political figures are jokes about the future they haven't yet, it's just unclear. Dick Cheney and George Bush are well done, but Dick Cheney usually mixes. There is also Condoleeza Rice who, for some reason, has a loved one for Bush, and Donald Rumsfeld who is not at all like Donald Rumsfeld. The democratic characters seldom give their names, so it is a mystery about who might be deviating from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> The episodes have coherent stories, but it's not nearly enough to make it sink.
