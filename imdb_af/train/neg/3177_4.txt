I have to admit that her dead body wasn't really as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I just thought to go ahead and see the horror in front of my eyes, but it wasn't really bad. I just expected this scary movie, but the authors seem to have done no harm, but the favor of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry) looks a little to her for the movie. I think I found it to be a bit better without her, just irritating me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the movie a little fun. But you have to admit there was no point in this movie, it was one of those quick salaries for the actor type thing. The movie could have been cleaner if someone really paid attention to it and had a better throw. <br /> <br /> Henry just lost his bride, Kate, who was killed by an ice image on their wedding day. . But when his sister takes him to a psychologist, Ashley, Henry falls to her, but Kate haunts her from outside the grave. Kate is jealous and doesn't want Henry to move so fast and she'll make sure Ashley doesn't get her tortured with her rambles day and night, believe me, with Kate's voice, it's scary. <br /> <br /> About her dead body is a good movie, not sure if it's worth the money, but I give you a rental if you want to see or are curious. Eva Longoria just doesn't have enough strength to make the film work, no offense to those who love her, she's just on the small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she still doesn't look too nice with everything she does, or her "gay" friend, Dan, just again, not really nice. Just with a few repetitions and proper attention, this movie could have been better, but we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
