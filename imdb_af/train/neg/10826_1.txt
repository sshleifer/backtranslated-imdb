I can't say it's the worst movie of all time, but just because there are movies I haven't seen yet! It must be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same issues he had with "There Will Be Blood" (although he wasn't that bad in that movie. The whole movie feels as if you are looking at a man who is hardly trying to impress his ability "It's as if he's sitting in his little director's chair thinking," How is a big filmmaker going to handle this scene? "He just didn't have it in him. I don't know if this movie could be saved by a big movie maker. Some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to maturity, the scene where all the characters sing, was the worst moment in film history, one by one as we saw the characters singing and I got into put my seat, Did I say "please, PLEASE, don't just sing the man on the verge of death!" Sure enough, MASSIVE FAULT!
