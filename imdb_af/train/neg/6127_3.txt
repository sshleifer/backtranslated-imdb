As I am from Hungary, I have heard many people who have been better and better about Uvigigris so far, but I really do not understand the reason for all the fuss. <br /> <br /> I liked a lot of movies, some of the quotes really encouraged me, but the stereotypical characters are present again, as in every Hungarian movie, and the story is pretty boring. I had the first half, but then I got bored, and then I just found the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Peter is good as always, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the other is just there ... nothing does. <br /> <br /> How many years should still be passed for a GOOD Hungarian film ???
