This fake trip never comes close to the whiteness of the great adventure these guys took in their first movie. This installment tries to deviate from its prequel to catch some new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and trips nowhere interesting or funny. <br /> <br /> There is almost half an hour wasting the guys doing a rock concert (and many people watch "free TV" - since when did it happen?) Certainly, the writer could do something more creative has; watch how all the random elements of the first movie are neatly tied together by a summary of them at the science presentation. Not in this movie that did the Bill & Ted franchise well. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix. This infusion, like the whole plot, is poorly done and has sparks for comedy or hearing involvement. There is a ZZ Top impression, hammered without reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
