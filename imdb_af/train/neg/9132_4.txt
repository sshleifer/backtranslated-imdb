The fiery plot of dr. Fu Manchu with Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice until the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic, and when finished, the right way could be properly handled, but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reason why this movie was not so good was the poor dialogue, cheap laughter, cunning directing and an uncomfortable feeling that the movie was somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> The play, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest in this mixed picture. I portrayed sellers of diabolic Manchu brilliantly, with occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused, which is a henchman, in which he says, "Oh, you all look the same to me." I hate to admit, but I laughed out loud with the line. <br /> <br /> Of course, a vigorous supportive character caught my attention with Helen Mirren as the backstage constable, David Tomilson, as Sir Roger Avery (also his last film, not a way to end a career not), and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capone's family member working for the FBI). These characters also made me look. <br /> <br /> The sets were also nice. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 were depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, my advice is to watch the movie if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid. Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you are better off settling on cold aluminum foil.
