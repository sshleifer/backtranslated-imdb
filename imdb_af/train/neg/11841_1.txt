What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? As soon as a brilliant director is out, a drag jacket is now scraping. Is this the same man who directed the Last Picture Show? Here he takes a somewhat interesting (though dyed) premise and turns it into bubble gum that loses taste when you take the first bite. Dust is not bad, but Izzard is miscast as Chaplin and all the other actors seem to be thrown for their "looks", not because they were right for the part. Sorry. I'll rent Paper Moon again.
