Watched it on TV. I'm glad I didn't go to the theater to see if the money was spent on rent. The film is completely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to the electrical cables. The plot is really poor and incredible. The avalanche expert man is hit by a 20 foot wave of bone waste (with real footage) and all he has to do is stand up and shake himself. The avalanche thunders at a million miles per hour and stops dead on the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the real avalanche materials are impressive and show its devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the plays makes this movie even look flicker. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't save this one even at T.V.
