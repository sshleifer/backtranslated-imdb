I really don't get all the adulation this movie has received. It is uncomfortable, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the major issues - ie Nash's affairs and his love of having sex with men in public places. I think, in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie, is just about tolerant, but what is praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to be swinging, folding his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow it looks like a nice play? Anyone who ever knows a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is little caricature. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just on the right to be really awful
