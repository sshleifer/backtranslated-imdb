Like a sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is a fake. <br /> <br /> As someone who was born in Sheffield and still has links to the city, I was very disappointed by this movie. Somebody said it could be put in Oklahoma, and it made up for me. It looks like a romantic view of northern England made for the US market. Probably many Americans - and many South English people - do not realize that Sheffield is a large city of about half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants it was portrayed as a crazy dead-end semi-rural little town, where everyone in Sheffield looks like the same old-fashioned bar, and where people's idea of ​​a party in a town hall was in line. It was a small community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> The working class Sheffield men were completely different from their peer peers, who generally stand still and communicate in grunts and briefly dry comments. They do not speak, and they certainly do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even the rural institutions, presumably in the Peak district, looked strange to me. I recognized a few places where I was going to walk, but some of the pylons of pylons stretching over a dark landscape reminded me of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end I saw a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District crawls in summer with hikers and tourists in cars. It is located between two large cities. It's not a kind of desert. <br /> <br /> Regarding the idea that a young woman may fall in love, and lustfully, Pete Postlethwaite, it was ridiculous and could only have been a male dream. Her reasons for becoming his lover have never been made clear. None of the men showed that they had a partner or family; They were in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants a film about unemployed Sheffielders would be deceived. This Sheffield only exists in the minds of its middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a huge fake! <br /> <br />
