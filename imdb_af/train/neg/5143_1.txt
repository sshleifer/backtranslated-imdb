Even if 99.99% of the people who watched this movie are Brazilian, I will stay with the English as it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece cr * p. The worst thing I've seen for a long time. The children are terrible. Especially the boy. It was the first time I saw someone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a single voice, like a 5-year-old child before class. How can someone be as bad as the main actor of a movie? The storyline is so shallow, my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It's so simple it can be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for someone to enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-teenager; 2) You are so captivated by Globo's stupidity that you think anything that is Globo seal is great; 3) You have a serious brain injury. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! A disgrace to the Brazilian movie.
