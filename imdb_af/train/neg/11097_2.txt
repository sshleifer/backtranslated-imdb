This is exactly the kind of Saturday matinee series I loved during World War II. I was less than ten years old. And that's the audience this series is designed for. If we see it now, we must roar for his indifference and stupidity. The budget should have been almost nothing, given the shortcuts and repetitions. The acting? Well, it's Republicans, 1944. They read the lines .... and it undoubtedly took one to make them convincing. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
