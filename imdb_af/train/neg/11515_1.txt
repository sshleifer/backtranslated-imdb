and forget it. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna, hire 'Prove Proof', Willem Defoe is at least in that one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you can save the dialogue. You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop and Madonna is so terrible, it gets amusing. Why they should hit the original movie in this mess I will never know; think they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, is definitely NOT. <br /> <br /> However, if you rent the original 1979 movie, you'll enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 10/01.
