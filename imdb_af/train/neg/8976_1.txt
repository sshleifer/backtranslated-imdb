The first point that calls attention to "Always Mozart" is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simply because there is no story, script, plot or the minimum structure of a movie can recall. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overestimated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this senseless crap is one of his most hermetic films. I believe that neither has himself understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals explaining to justify or explain this messy movie, and it's funny to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
