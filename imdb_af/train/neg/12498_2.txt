This film is at the heart of a very good story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, are the things of heroes and legends. This film makes a good story with three ends (no satisfaction), some unnecessary and useless bar fighting and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have so much spark as a dead campfire. The rescue panels are wonderful - even though the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are unreal - but the wallpaper is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (look for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she is on the camera for about two minutes across the film. It could have been an excellent movie - and Costner needed one!
