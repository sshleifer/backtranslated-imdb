Terrible movie. If there is one Turkish movie, you should avoid it in 2006, it must be Banyo. What a waste of time. Other than some cheap laughs this movie reaches nothing, Nada, Zilch, Nil. The dialogue is cheap, and sexual clich√©s are all about it. The director should watch more movies before trying his own. The redhead women show examples of what an actress shouldn't do. If you are interested in learning how to do this, it is a perfect example of bad acting. The only good thing I can say about the movie, wait, wait, there's nothing I can say about it. I really didn't like writing that much of it. Jeez!
