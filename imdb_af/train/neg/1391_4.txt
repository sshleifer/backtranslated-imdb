Before it started for TV movies, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the last episode of the series was broadcast and much of the series was original. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, all the regular, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, have B-5 permanently on the second to last episode of the series. Now for this film, they returned Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the captain and doctor make a short and irrelevant appearance. But because so much of the old chemistry is gone, this film is already severely disabled. <br /> <br /> The film is about a soul hunter (Martin Sheen) led to Babylon 5 looking for a world globe filled with souls by an archaeologist (Ian McShane) from a hidden custody stolen. Many ghostly mumbo-jumbo things occur, but frankly, they were all pretty stupid and useless. Yes, yes, the station has almost blown up, but has been saved and all, but frankly I felt it was a case of "done there - and it did much better in the past". <br /> <br /> The secondary plot, which was more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo brothel and those in charge weren't sure what to do about it and then they tried to push them to close, they were beaten with a lawsuit. It was fluff, but it gave some laughter - something the other barren plot lacks. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen initially had a good job of playing the Should Hunter - with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. But repeatedly through the episode he fell out of character. It should have been seen and corrected. <br /> <br /> So, the final verdict, it's only for total evil-stubborn B-5 nuts (like me). Others see it as assuming the series is sucked - this is a great injustice. It's a good example of a show that doesn't know when to stop.
