This is an anti-Serbian propaganda movie made for TV. <br /> <br /> "The Muslims are good; the Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD." <br /> <br /> This is the message. <br /> <br /> The use of "entertainment" to come across a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie puts it on thick. <br /> <br /> And many viewers and judges seem to be popping up. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, are rescued over 500 fired American kites from the Germans during World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and place British backing behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed and consequently Yugoslavia was handed over to communist Tito after the war. <br /> <br /> Since then, US ally Milhalovitch has been spread by the media. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serbian propaganda campaign set up by George Soros and his international crisis group (ICG), which culminated in the Kosovo war, in which Serbia was bombed by NATO. because of the false claims by the ICG of "mass graves" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of the nasty Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians (Muslims) were not in Serbia's Kosovo, are facts that most of the media will not press. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie to watch because the one-sent description on the video cover looks interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my dislike when I discovered that I was another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia. of this propaganda, someone has to make a film about the reluctance of the Clinton administration to clean up Congress and with the American people about its complicity in delivering arms from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I won't wait for such a movie.
