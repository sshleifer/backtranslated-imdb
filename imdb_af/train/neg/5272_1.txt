It's waaaaay too much .. so frustrating to watch. I waited for the whole damn movie to end and finally get some ANSWERS! .. and what I finally had was nothing but a HUUUGE neon sign Paper above my head !!!!! I haven't seen such a bad play and such a nonsense movie for a long time. And what's bothering me is how does someone (an actor) write the script of such a bull !! # @ Film and say: OK, I AM IN !!! LET MOVE THIS! It's awful !!! THIS MOVIE SUVUUELUALLY !!!!!! I just can't believe I read about one and a half of my life on such a thing !!!
