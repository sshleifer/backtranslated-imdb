I recently watched Johnny Test in an effort to find humor in it. I failed, terrible. Cartoon Network usually tends to make their performances enjoyable by all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the running gags are not much at all. Children will love it, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Now, it's not saying it's bad. The original opening theme was actually tough, but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively beat it with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a pity, because it was actually one of the best things to do about it. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters may be very interesting in theory. With a little work, the characters work well, but they are too one-dimensional. Then again, it makes it easy for the children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pass is too fast. The episodes are too busy and leave little time for smart writing. This is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that make the show happen. At the front, however, the quick pace will stop the kids from losing interest and this is really the whole target audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks very good on paper but just doesn't succeed in being funny or interesting. This is a show I want, but I'm not able to. There is just as much potential that is not realized. Children will enjoy it, but it's about it.
