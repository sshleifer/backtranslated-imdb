Using images from the Planet of Dinosaurs, this shot on video (except for the stolen images) is a bunch of people shot in space on a dinosaur-planet land. It's ... wait, it's really the earth. It's a five minute sketch that is stretched up to 90 minutes. Slightly better than Chickboxer (another in the Bad Movie Police series). This is a nostalgic home movie feel along with good stolen effects. This movie is still an impossible hit to come through. I'm about to think about the question, are we becoming so unaware that we are now filming old movies, not just for plot, but also for erroneous footage? Clearly low budget producers are so desperate that they will really give us anything to take our money
