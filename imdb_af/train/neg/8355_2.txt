Wanda Nevada is a surprising fantasy film with about 1979 ideas of what constitutes illegal romance for 13-year-old girls. Scripture, pacing and direction are uniformly horrible. Action series reject faith. Characters speak with the simplified dictation that one usually finds in under 10-set films, but also includes various sexual references in terms of Shields' character as well as graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be a comedy on one level or another, but is never funny, an adventure photo, but plot and action are unsatisfactory, and a children's movie, but suggest pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a girl photo, an age photo, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travel book and a western. The overall influence is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a total waste of time unless you want to see quite a few huge shots from the Grand Canyon. That it will do well.
