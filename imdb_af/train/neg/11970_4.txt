... for the Lt to choose this one. First, the movie wasn't terrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst case I need-this-to-happen-or-our-no-movie scenario: if Willis's purpose was to save the doctor, but she was determined that her "people" made it out of the missionary, he would have put her on the first helicopter and had those refugees marched to the border without her. He would not have compromised his refugee package. This is not how it works. But, as I have pointed out, it is Hollywood, we must have drama. That's why we make movies, because reality is not quite that complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had real chemistry. There are also some well-done battle scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth DVD rentals. Going out on a rainy day and you'll be happy.
