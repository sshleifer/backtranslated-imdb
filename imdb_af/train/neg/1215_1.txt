I don't often give a star review, but the computer doesn't allow me negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles tell us we are already in deep water. Although it is a low budget exploitation film, 17 producers have been credited. No. <br /> <br /> At the start of the story, the abused man Kenneth joins his family in an exclusive gated community. The house is a pigtail. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), runs the kids all day long. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Me. Basinger was 55 when the film came out. Uh, is it her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives to the mall, a long scene that could be cut. To destroy the idea of ​​one-man aggression in the universe, she drives past soccer players in full uniform and plays on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer attached to it. <br /> <br /> However, we get real tension in the management scenes. It's raining and traffic is bad. First, we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. At the same time, Della tries to drive and talk on her cellphone, turning around at one point to look at the charger for the phone. <br /> <br /> She wanders the mall, sees an old college friend, tries to buy stuff, but her credit card is declined. Gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he broke, but it's too complicated for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> In the parking lot she runs the most ridiculous gang in the history of movies. One white boy (Lukas Hass looks after his career in the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Spanish. Imagine a company with Up with People going to the bad and you will have the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a gun, they give their attitude. A shopkeeper comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head and shoot more than once. The parking lot is crowded, and people are everywhere and nobody knows. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or a well-lit safe area, she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with just the tools (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> LARGE spoiler. <br /> <br /> She drives back home. The car came out so she ran through the pouring rain. Checks on the children go down, and when her husband asks for a petrol to get to the mall, show him the gun and shoot him at an empty point. <br /> <br /> The experience with the four punks was supposed to lead to personal empowerment for Della. Instead, we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home because the state will collect them while giving answers to kill one charge. The four punks can be classified as self-defense as justifiable murder. The man, different story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it on the cable. If I saw it in a theater (did it get release?) I was furious. As I am, I'm just sad because talents like me. Basinger and Mr. Hurry they wasted on such a garbage. <br /> <br /> A very good thing though. It's written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford hasn't got another writing or credit yet. There is justice in the world.
