Hey if you have a little more than an hour to kill and find paint to be exciting, I suggest. If you like cheap b-movies like me, it's good for a giggle! Other than that, I don't suggest renting it, I will wait until it comes to the tube, say at 4am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. The band, which was almost on the road, was about two years after this movie, and no, they just stayed as bad according to the two village reviews I could find on them. Well again if you find grass fun, but good to see if you want to see how to shoot a low budget movie.
