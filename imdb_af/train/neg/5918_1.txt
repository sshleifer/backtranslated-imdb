Carl Panzram lived a wonderful life and scraped his memoirs on paper. He was perhaps the only person who ever did him selfless. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, who invented the better part of a century after Panzram's death, gives away the historical context to a US first generation's account to walk from home. to go west and be a cowboy, to be caught, thrown into the boy's house, repeatedly escaped and thrown into jail, over and over again tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew big and strong, he tried to take revenge for the injustice he did to him when he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa. No matter what people raped, robbed or murdered, for we are all equally worthless. <br /> <br /> This film slashes James Woods as the coarse neck, common ass, son of a bitch Carl Panzram who is "drunk" in the film, too dramatic and emotional, and never mentioned no. The joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film doesn't work any more, especially at the height of this world traveler and career prisoner (such as robbing former president Taft or being released from Oregon prison as long as he has given his word to return). In short, I don't think Carl will be too happy.
