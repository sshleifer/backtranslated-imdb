I expected a little something from "K-911", I mean it looked like a cute movie I could get. I always love the dog comedy movies. But it seemed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry. Not to mention that James has a total sexist view in the movie, despite the fact that the author does not go in that direction. James only really chose me for more than half of the movie. The dogs were the real stars and it is pretty sad that they are watching the actors. <br /> <br /> So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb, but it agrees that it was a little silly movie. But hopefully James will realize that it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone could be their star brother or sister. Don't you want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
