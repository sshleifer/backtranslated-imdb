As a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, and the variety of his skills, I saw this movie, and was amazed that I didn't hear about it. <br /> <br /> I traveled more than usual during both the time it was filmed in 2000, and when it comes to theaters more than 2-1 / 2 years later, it's the first idea that everything doesn't go well with the production was not. <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze can't act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone that would be a pleasure to see, even though it showed how it was dry. <br /> <br /> To be curious, I reviewed this production information from this site. This made his opening weekend a spectacular <$ 600 per screen, and just over $ 400 each, after the month's theater was held last year in 2002. The total gross was $ 261K, which I can doubt over the week cover the hotel and food of the guests and crew. location. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty benign, and even using the usually interesting place of Reno is as boring as the rest of the gaits. <br /> <br /> It's something like a few SNL bits are all cut together, no one is too big, and the overall presentation is even worse. <br /> <br /> Whatever the cost of this production, they had to be substantial - even though they all worked less than their usual fees - so the one thing that made it a scarcely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bob's presence (though understandably somewhat laconic here, compared to his usual work.) Think of the three beautiful, completely different characters he portrayed in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa" and you Knowing he got this job under standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm it. One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than the typical "lifetime" movie.
