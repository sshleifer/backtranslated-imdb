After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series hit rock-bottom with this very poor fourth entry. At least, the third film (unsuccessful) tried to continue the story of Damien, while this one just repeated and copied ideas of the "Omen" (animals are afraid of the Antichrist, the death of one man is very similar to dead of the photographer in the first movie). But what looks exciting and creative does not look stupid. And the girl simply looks like a spoiled child.
