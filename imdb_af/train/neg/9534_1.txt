I'm a fan of the previous best of the best movies. But this one was terrible. No wonder I had such a difficult time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found one with a copy of this movie. The scene was horrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was also bad. <br /> <br /> I miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this movie had at first. 2 movies. <br /> <br /> John
