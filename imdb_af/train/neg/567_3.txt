This movie is one of the most horrible movies ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer who is not an actor. What does he kill vampires with his guitar? And what about the terrible plot? Oh my God really sucks this movie. Eventually the Queen of Vampires is played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" victims come, only 4 vampires are left! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They walk out in the sun ??? And what about the "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun? It's really a "NOT". In 'Buffy the vampire Slayer' in 100 episodes, a single vampire is not killed with a SHOTGUN ??? It's really a lack of originality!
