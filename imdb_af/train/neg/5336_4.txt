This movie is not very good. In fact, this is the worst Elvis movie I saw. It has very little plot, mostly party, beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they did this movie. You can say that Elvis is also wasted, he is much better at "Follow That Dream."
