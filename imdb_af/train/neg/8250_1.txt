I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and wanted to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I can say I'm ashamed to have any part of it. I feel ashamed not only for myself but for everyone who participated in making this mockery of the British "comedy". <br /> <br /> From start to finish, the movie is predictable, boring, boring, monotonous and cringing to the point that I actually looked away from the screen. Until you actually see the movie, it's hard to understand how romantic and un-comedic can be a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, but a bad movie. In one scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director telling the S.A when to wipe over. I'll post details of this in the 'Goofs' section. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, anger, embarrassment).
