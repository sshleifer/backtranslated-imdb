This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and has returned the world eye to what remains of the "Wild West Canada". When Archie wrote his stories for the newspapers; The thought of the day was to tame the desert and transform / absorb the first nation of nations. <br /> <br /> The movie sets forth and asks the question; Why would a well-educated, naturally talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams of becoming something, but understanding the full meaning of that dream, is unique and valuable - no mater it is. Sounds like a famous puppet story. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I became Archie my living image of the "cigar shop Indian", a very wood character and not really - very well done by Mr Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and reality of it was not realized until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushes Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the English world team, not himself, but Gray Owl - a Canadian Wilderness border native. <br /> <br /> It's the closest Archie to become the noble savage prototype. <br /> <br /> Mr Brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors are both well done. I watched documentaries on Gray Owl and I think it's a great big screen movie to join my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie would meet the Grand Council of Chiefs, was a wonderful moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian more scenic and real Gray Owl sites. <br /> <br />
