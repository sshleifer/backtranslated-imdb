With no affinity for any kind of movies, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry with myself for letting down the entire length of the "20 Dates". I won't waste your time on the plot, you can read other reviews. I would say that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen style narrative was extremely annoying. You also wanted him to take the coffee or take tranquility. And it is obvious to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it described his trials to fund the documentary document. Forgive me for the disguise of insults as compliments, but I give Berkowitz credit for the skills to convince an idiot to fund this terrible piece of ****. I appreciate the film's boundaries and intentions here, but even when the standards set by Berkowitz differ, it falls on all levels. Eventually, I am sure that many of these female companions were not comfortable on a date with a drunk will-be movie maker, and so I questioned the film's sense of authenticity. Hey Myles, I saw your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or a movie by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
