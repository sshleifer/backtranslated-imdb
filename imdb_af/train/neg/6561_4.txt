The opening series is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops descended from the train - with the uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, ascended into war in 1914! It is a turkey that is a sure sign on which the war goes. (The French army realized in 1915 that the war didn't work in red pants and navy blue trousers. Metropolitan French troops were placed in "horizon blue" and colonial troops were placed in khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Remake at least got the uniforms done. It's really too bad when directors make such mistakes when they make every effort to get things right.
