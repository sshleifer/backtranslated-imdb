Steve Martin must stop trying remake of classic comedy. He absolutely doesn't fit this part. Like the unfortunate memory of the out of towners, this movie falls flat on his face. How somebody ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to Jack Lemmon's amazing show is out of my mind, and this movie too. Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko part better. Martin is wonderful when he does his own original characters, but fails to recreate other people's classic work. This is a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is included in the first line of credits when the movie is over. The line "The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the US Army" was just about the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, you get the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. It is guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that would never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the former Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho. None of them ever had to.
