The only redeeming quality of this overcrowded melodrama is the natural beauty of Southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri who sings the theme song. Stephanie Powers is overlooked and betrayed by a false accent. As noted, is she too old to be an 18-year-old parent and looks too young as a grandmother with a granddaughter granddaughter? Lee Remick is good, although she is also oblivious in her later years. Talented Joanna Lumley is in use and also manages to look young forever when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer can relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who resembles the rest of the film as rankers. It emphasizes credibility that the handsome male contenders in this epic will ever stay one day while patiently awaiting the subject of their feelings to finally accept them. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich will be alone for decades and wait for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 association between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the Provence part of France until late in the war. It was controlled by the Vichy-French puppet government. We see the French resistance set up a daylight in Mistral's villa to steal skins, whereupon they all sit under a bridge waiting for a clumsy Nazi truck to surprise and destroy them? If you want to see a well-activated mini-series in a foreign country, don't look at Mistral's daughter. A better alternative is The Thorn Birds.
