I know the people and I've done the animation and graphic design and the show is terrible! They're rich little kids who don't have talent, and probably just asked Nick to accept them! Alex played the drums for one year, I played for 4 1/2! The movie is terrible and so is the show! This is the craziest most mixed comedy that's even quite funny I've ever seen. It's so stupid that it made me burst! It's just as crazy that Nickelodeon will ever accept such a thing and so stupid! They are so stupid and strange! I hate them and their performance and think as soon as Nick realizes how stupid it is, hopefully they'll take it down!
