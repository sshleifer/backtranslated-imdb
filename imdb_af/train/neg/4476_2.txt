I just saw this movie premium on MTV. I must say it was extremely mediocre (at best). The dialogue did not explain the story very well, and I felt that there were many plot holes. There is no similar character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all the characters are possessed when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love looks very offensive. Rather, they look like brothers and sisters rather than lovers. I don't understand why the father would accept such a thing under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of some actors I respected and enjoyed watching in previous movies, but as I said, it's very difficult to keep any of the characters . Katherine Heigl's performance was terrible, which was a complete shocker. She was terrible to be Edward's old older sister, and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth played well and it was great to see him something new and although his character was a little cook, he was the only person I went through. As far as Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel are concerned, they were supposed to be our heroines, but just as furious and over-rammed. <br /> <br /> I just didn't enjoy this movie or the music in it. There was a short look of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that little look wouldn't convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job convincing me that it wasn't a movie. I just introduced something so completely different.
