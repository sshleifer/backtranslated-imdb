What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... Let's make a 30 minute show about it and have some kids making noise and then the dad needs them everyone is teaching, because that's what he has to do. <br /> <br /> But don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some strange noises and cake faces, then Uncle Jesse has to come up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everyone is discussing how Mother would have done things if she were around. <br /> <br /> Yep, full of many adventures over a whole lot of nothing and a long storyline to build on it. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only lead you to tears, but it will make your age twenty times faster than you normally would.
