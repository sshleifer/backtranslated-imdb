Maria Bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movies. She again chooses a very difficult and non-popular movie to die in. Maybe she needs those movies to do the sugar cover (aka "Hollywood") she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3) /> <br /> Although I don't think I can achieve that (I'll do it not spoiled), Maria Bello is as big as in her other independent / small films in which she stars. This is her performance that elevates Fliek. Combined with the strange subject, it almost made me a trick. But in the end (and even if I try to ignore mistakes, such as bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long
