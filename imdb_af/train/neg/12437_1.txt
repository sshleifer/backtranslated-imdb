'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone movies not to starve Culkin and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original 'Home Alone' movie. Instead of two comic villains, we get three or four of them. This movie involves a few falls, but it also has a long scene with a remote control car. The slapstick humor is also consistent, but the young boy and the villains don't really work on this movie. (No pun is meant.) This movie doesn't offer anything new or different from the previous movies, and there really isn't the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two movies had. It's more of a pure comedy, but it didn't make me laugh, because the characters didn't really do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; this is pretty boring. If you are looking for a good holiday family movie with comedy, watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.
