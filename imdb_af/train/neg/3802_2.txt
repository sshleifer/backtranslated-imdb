I know actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies. Hey, nobody wants a prediction, but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd knew better than that. "Angels abroad" is another movie in which everything looks lost until someone or something comes to life and saves the day. Should I even tell you how it ends? The movie is just a low escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi films from the 50's). If these movies had some political undertones - or at least gave us a new look at life - then they would be OK; this one is just useless. Much closer to diabolical than English. Also the lead role of Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect they don't want to emphasize it in their CV.
