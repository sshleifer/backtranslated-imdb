This film is known for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two Superman series, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, which include George Reeves 'and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances like Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is used again in the series. Outside the city of Silby, a six mile deep milestone penetrates the 'hollow earth' so that the 'mole men' can come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Contrary to most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) power in the preaching and enforcement of tolerance and acceptance of the difference against an angry crowd of segregation vigilantes. No 'soft-mannered reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-confident, seizes control of the situation throughout ("I'll handle it!"), Even helping in a hospital gown in removing a bullet from a Mole Man! As Superman he is softer than Clark to the physical Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance, as he stands against the vigilantes as "Nazi storm troops". <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you'll notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated pilot from Superman to the two series to the "live action" flown in the "Adventures of Superman" has not yet been made. no.
