I need to love this movie. The acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie has always been great to me. The film makes the working class look good and cheap. The fact that the daughter was ashamed of her and that the daughter did not rise above him made me rather uncomfortable. Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter, but the daughter forfeits a mother's love of happiness with her good to do father's family. I wonder how many other people this movie has seen, feel this way about it. The acting was very good and worth watching. I really don't like the story line. just a personal preference. thank you
