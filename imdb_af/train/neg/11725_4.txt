STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding on his farm in Montana after not being infamous terrorist caught. Then he was approached by the agency again to travel to London to go again. His target is trapped there and is under heavy police security - but they don't want him to just catch their husband - they want him to be pulled out. Everything goes well, but then the mission is blocked. When a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls on Dial's feet. He is hunted like an animal, escapes in a nearby house, and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who deals with her own issues and becomes his subconscious sidekick. He will clean up his name and work out what has betrayed him. br /> <br /> These latest snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with minimal publicity even for such a small amount of time (I don't remember any ads or trailers about it) with this in mind and after Snipes Its history of duff DVD efforts may have seemed like one that Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop as it was hot. But I was forced to give it anyway. It is not below its worst, but it does not exceed the standards of some of its better (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, it also really says). <br /> <br /> It's at its best, generously exciting, with minimal action, after all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes, not exactly at its best. Similarly, in a main supporting role, it is quite clear that Dans also only acted for the payment test. It is generally one that none of the governors will shout at the hills. <br /> <br /> It says a lot that the only "contract" you are interested in is ultimately when Snipes's will ends with Sony and puts an end to any further subpar EL DVD action movies. **
