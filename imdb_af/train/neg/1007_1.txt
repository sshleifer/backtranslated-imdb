I found it very difficult to watch it after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to beat 45-50 minutes before turning it off in horror and looking at Monster House instead (which is a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> The story has massive holes in it. The plot line is extreme and boring, the acting is terrible, especially by Justin Timberlake, who really has to stick to what he is good at (watch and sing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he turned to rock music for no apparent reason halfway through the movie and met Timberlake. Freeman's and Timberlake's characters seem to have some kind of father / son relationship of any kind or something, which simply isn't clearly visible, except that; Although Freeman's character has nothing but contempt for Timberlake's ignorant and rather stupid character, he never diminishes, helping him to solve a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It will take a bit of incredible suspension of unbelief to give credit to the story line, which was simply absurd and out of all relationships. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie, it's a pure waste of time.
