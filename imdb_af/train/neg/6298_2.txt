A horrible storyline (Amis at its worst), useless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and laughter acting, make this film (rather than "Rancid Aluminum") all that went wrong with the promising British movie revival. The humor is at its best, and the pretentiousness of the whole set-up (including a kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how contemporary) really boasts. Final summary - a half-baked attempt to be "edgy", which nobody does. Yet it is always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen <br /> <br />
