In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. While excluding documentary and other experimental forms of film making; Most movies, especially genre movies, should not just tell the story or message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. All this to just say that a bad movie is not a movie with low production values ​​or low budget is a bad movie that's boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the Prohibited", as known in the US, is a bad movie simply because it is not involved, and relentlessly boring and tiring. Although it is a very good point of departure, it is only poorly developed and the mediocre acting does not make things better. On another hand, the movie might be a fine or even classic B movie, but here it is just a bad attempt to make film. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatrist resident, who has just received his dream job at St Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the continuing rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is going on; just about the boss's unbelief, dr. Find McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes the bishop goes as crazy as his patients. <br /> <br /> Whilst the point of departure is very interesting, the performance of the movie leaves much to be desired. In an effort to make a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way out and fills a movie with every cliché of the genre. Of course, there are many movies that are also filled with clichés; But in "Hellborn" everyone is wasted and it becomes a cheap fringe to make things move, leading to a boring and predictable story. <br /> <br /> The play is pretty mediocre, with one great exception: Bruce Payne gives a top performance making the movie unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi is very poor as the main character and the rest of the cast makes forgetful performances. <br /> <br /> Despite all these flaws, one thing has to be written about "Hellborn"; It has a visual appearance very good for the budget and very similar to today's big-budget Hollywod horror productions. Also, the makeup and prosthetics are very well done and the designs for the main antagonist are pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are terrible and outdated, which makes a great contrast to the makeup and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie with some good stuff due to its serious flaws with terrible results. Hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested in his point of departure, but it is a boring and tiring experience. 10/03
