I watched a movie I thought for almost two hours, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened. I was angry because I could have used that time to do something else. I tried to figure it all out, but really had no idea. Thanks to those who figured it out and explained it .... right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the lady in the dark hair movie that drove us away a few times? How did First Lady know that her husband was deceiving her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we will be subject to End Game 2?
