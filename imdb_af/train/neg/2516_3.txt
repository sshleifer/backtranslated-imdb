Unfortunately, I no longer remember the book, but I remember being captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. It does not keep my attention - although the story itself is good, it is only badly tackled. In the midst of the misery, the characters who are overly simple and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well-known and fond of German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Are cannot save this poor spectacle. But there is hope ... I said the movies that follow this one are getting better and better. Finally, I must say that this movie does not deserve the movie screen, but can be enough for a lazy afternoon.
