Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a movie should probably pass this one. It generates the same feeling as looking at a curious variety of individual images, which apparently have a relationship with each other, but never rally into totality. <br /> <br /> While this isolate approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage can appeal to some students or critics who have touched on the inner language of contemporary film filming. It's just annoying and derogatory for our ordinary people who just dropped off the hay wagon. Excessive avoidance of accessibility may be the deliberate feature of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but it gets over when Andy Warhol gets warm. The only redeeming feature I find is in the production values, and they will not only cut through themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and anxiously wait and in vain for a clever development of an idea or thought to maintain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. The calligraph credits start to roll unexpectedly just as your interest begins to stir. I get the same great yawn and read what I think are very knowledgeable and thorough remarks about this movie that never lead to anything. Ideas and images without any external context are not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a philistine roaming in the streets of Hong Kong, look for a bakkie suey. <br /> <br />
