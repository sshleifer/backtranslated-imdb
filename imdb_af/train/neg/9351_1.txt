It's just the second time I've been through a video / DVD part. <br /> <br /> I was prepared to first give this film the benefit of the doubt, although it both level, click and stupid .. and joyfully, plowing and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like a post-school specialist directed by that strange grade nine child who thinks nobody understands him ... creepy and sad, with narrative narrative that will only be the most deceived adolescent poetry considering ... and some singing, and ... no, really, the poor child's suffering ... Enough, already, especially when it got into a buyer, clumsy and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. And did I call the song? <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but definitely the one I felt the least to go through. I do not recommend it to anyone.
