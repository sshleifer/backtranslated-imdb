I'm a big fan of the old westerns, and don't believe Hollywood is able to catch its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie, which carries almost all the broad features of westerners of the reformed rifle battle. cases, but virtuous women, excited townspeople who have to go to the weapon plane for rescue, etc. I can't help but notice the last names of the author and young "actor" playing Granger's son. Any nepotism there? I performed better in high school playing. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I reached the 1000 words?
