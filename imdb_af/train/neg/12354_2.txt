Of course, I didn't choose 'GI Jane'. I was more or less obliged to watch this movie around my ex-girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses his credibility right away by trying to convince the viewer that this is a real scenario, of course. As a result, the story is automatically bound by constraints that limit the amount of humor (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes and soon become too serious. The film is therefore extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' fails where other action films pass, mainly because movies like James Bond, Dirty Harry and several others are bigger than life, but never preach otherwise. They are escape, and therefore entertaining. "GI Jane" really tries and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie by Ridley Scott, with a very non-credible story, unbeatable acting, and the only reason I give it 2/10 Instead of 1/10 it is for some of the technical work.
