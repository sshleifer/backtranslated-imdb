Oh, dear. good throwing, but to write and to right is an art and to write white and direct white is a bit of a task. Even good comedy you should get the time and moment right. I didn't put it all down there, but there were parts where I laughed hard, but it was very few times. The main focus for me was on the quick free dialogue that made some people in the movie annoying. It may sound good while you read the script in your head but get it out and the camera is a different task. And the hand-camera work gives energy to few parts of the film. Overall direction was good, but the writing was not just for me, but I'm sure you read the script in your head, it will sound good. Sorry.
