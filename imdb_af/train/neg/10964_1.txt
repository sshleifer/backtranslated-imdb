I was sorry to see it at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the last nail in the coffin. As a popular fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice books, I was very excited about the movie's premier, who made it just as much uncomfortable to watch. Normally I am enthusiastic about modern repetition when treated well. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately, this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the original characters was young and was usually terribly annoying. It probably didn't help the actors to be very good either. Most shows were ridiculous on top, which I think was either due to bad direction or an attempt to make a bad writing. I didn't laugh at the film once. All the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that will surely lose their poignancy if time goes by. In fact, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit was heading to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I would have to say that converting the croquet match into a rave dance was terrible. It was without a doubt the low point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Don't see this movie. After that I was really angry.
