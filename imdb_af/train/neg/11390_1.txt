It's not a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, weak and poorly mounted scenes that resembles the unedited results of a dull 10-year-old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abusive girl in the train corridor - one with the greasy hair, the dodpan star, the ipod and the nervous system - probably shot it in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you go beyond the ten minutes I've done, don't worry about what you've seen in the context of the European Artiste mentality praised above. It's a real and complete waste of time, money and film that would make William One-Shot Beaudine circles. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters are representative of what is now passing for many of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors are socializing at the Wal-Mart snack bar?
