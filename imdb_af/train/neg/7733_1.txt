What a shame! I checked it out with the hope that it would be an undiscovered James Garner jewel and what a stinker it would seem to be! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was undeniably paralyzed and I can honestly say that I am just a few hours older and much duller. The movie really has no redeeming qualities and if this kind of thing still comes out, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it's about, it's nothing, and in this case it's not a good thing. We are subject to an old old woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to fly around the world. They are married to a true sweetheart who is probably the only living one that can stand up to her. She drags him through one mess to another, gets him into one embarrassing situation after another, and is proud of herself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! Not the time it will take to look at it, so do yourself a favor and save this one, you will be glad you did when you knew how bad this one is.
