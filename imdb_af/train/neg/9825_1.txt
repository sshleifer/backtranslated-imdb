This movie looks like the wrong message is being sent. There can be morality without using Christ. Pooples of other religions, I believe, can come to heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I disagree with such Christian arrogance. It's the worst travel movie I've ever seen and I've seen timeline.
