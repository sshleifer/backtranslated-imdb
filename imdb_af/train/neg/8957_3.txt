Unbelievable. Is it thinner than this? Not a chance. The stupidity in this movie would even be ashamed of Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part in the series had mediocre dialogue and the second had a bad dialogue, then this one has a grim dialogue. Amazing. But this time, the story was also reduced to the level of the dialogue. Despite the play and the dialogue, I kept the first two movies, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. The completely moronic plot comes so clearly from the pen of a frustrated left wing. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if such left-wing people even realize how anti-democracy and pro-democracy they are. Of course, in this movie they are aimed at the USA ?? a democracy. Why isn't it aimed at Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in anti-military movies? Certainly, most of these places are unlikely to produce a cube soon, but this is beyond the point. Obviously, garbage writers like this admire these kinds of regimes, whether they are aware or not. I will even go so far as to say that anyone who attacks the US foreign policy always has anti-democratic beliefs in its core. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: apart from being so far-fetched that it's not even funny, the movie has a lot of ambiguities. For example, the two men who oversee the cube have been doing it for a while and are unaware of the pain and sadism that the project entails, but the first one if the other suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea about human nature will see through this idiot. Or how about the clumsy character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat who speaks as if he's in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, once this creature appears, the movie loses ALL seriousness and therefore a chance to be exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
