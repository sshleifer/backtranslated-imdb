DARK REMAINS is an American US horror movie with a low budget that somehow wins 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to involve 2 separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists while bathing. Secondly, the young daughter of a technical writer is cut with her throat. The sad couple decided to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later turns out that the cabin and surrounding places are haunting. <br /> <br /> As the movie goes on, the two separate strings of the story eventually come together as can reasonably be expected. However, the performance is haphazard and leads to confusion that can only be resolved through several views. Unfortunately, the movie simply isn't enough to attract most viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Just about anything that can go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget can't be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. <br /> <br /> I believe it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production as the material was just too poor. /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting as indicated by other reviewers on this site. The badly written text suggests too many people without giving them an interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without giving them any depth. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired. The inspiration of J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is clear. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not emphasize J-Horror's style. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Stress is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (for example, a ghost on a CCTV camera going after it), and the response of a central character that is confronted without warning. There is no humor or tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without repentance or limitations that you can't help but convinced and enchanted. The precocious atmospheres set the tension and ensure that the abomination has psychological impact, much in contrast to the "jump scares" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The directors of DARK REMAINS have made a bold effort to avoid Hollywood cliches and also successfully avoid using CGI. The tribute to J-Horror could have been well planned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the suspected "fright" on the screen. The makeup effects of the "ghosts" were not too bad with the low budget, but their actions just denied logic. I scratched my head a couple of times during the movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't finish even if I wanted to. I simply couldn't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What remains? The answer as a reviewer on another website pointed out that it's bored. The movie is a task to go through. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. Most will probably only switch off before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only 2 positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of terrible cliches and the absence of the "f word" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find . That's where the 2 stars go. <br /> <br /> Those who like supernatural or psychological horrors that are haunting and haunting can do well to films such as the LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING or the J-Horror subgenre. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure, ultra-low budget "R-rated" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OR A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the biggest horror movie ever made, but it is certainly much better than DARK RESTER and has some real store surprises. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DARK RESTERS like the pest.
