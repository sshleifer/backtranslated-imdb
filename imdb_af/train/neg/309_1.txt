Hello. I'm Paul Raddick, viz. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god, horrible movie that went on Adam Sandler's film career, but after a short while digitized it. <br /> <br /> Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a ship and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler meets babies who are like World History Part 1 and Rebound. The babies were supposed to be engaged, but they were actually carried out by Sawtooth, the most common cannibal that the world ever had. Adam Sandler did badly in Going Overboard, but performed better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Date. Man, Drew Barrymore was a hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard is not Dooley squat! End of file.
