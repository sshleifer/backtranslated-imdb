I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers. Even the cover of the DVD looks good. As soon as I started to look at it, I thought like others. "Oh my God, what is it?" There were a few moments a little creepy, but when the mood was devastated by silly music. There was rock and opera during what was supposed to be tension. It ruined it for me and I shook my mind and thought. I lost money again a rental and was deceived by the cover art. Nothing against the music itself, but it was just in the wrong parts of the movie. Whoever changed the movie has no idea what they are doing. The cover showed lightning, which meant they were in a storm at sea. It would have been more interesting, but that didn't happen. The acting was not the worst I have ever seen since they are all unknown and it is obvious their first movie. Another reason I was disappointed was that the plot didn't make sense. In the beginning, 2 men saw all the teenagers. boat, then there was only one girl at the end and the other was her imaginative friends or were ghosts. I'm not sure, because it is very poorly portrayed. WhyteFox who made a comment here claims it's a real story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a ghost boat in the area. This film is filmed. There was no mention in this movie that it was a true story. . I've never experienced such a thing, but don't say it's impossible. I think anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur student horror movies, you might like it.
