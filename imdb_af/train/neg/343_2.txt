A real, really rare Canadian German co-production, the wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few years before the action, the child killed her father. the fall for the offspring. Now she's moved to the North-West US to start over, but her child still has a problem because she's dedicated to her mother. So devoted to killing anyone who can be considered a threat to their band. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (as the daughter) kills more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also cattle from the movie, though the incoherent script, useless direction and horrible music (see the saxophone the first time she shows her bikini dressed bids); We're supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails on both points. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer aren't really convinced as a mother and daughter), all compassion for me. Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, who are both much more valuable than This, and both (especially Rosanna) are the only reasonable reasons why anyone goes through this farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the manufacturing companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three hours of love. , Lies And Murder "(from Two Short Productions) there was such a" You must joke "credit.
