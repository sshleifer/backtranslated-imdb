"The Leap Years" is a movie adapted from an e-novel by Singapore writer Catherine Lim, who became the first Singapore novel / novella to be sold over the Internet. The film has a bad post-production schedule: shot early in 2005, it was released at the end of 2005, but only ends 3 years later on 29 February 2008 a leap year. <br /> Before I say anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the romance genre, so I can be a bit biased against this movie. I just watched it because it was a Singapore production and that it is available for loans. at my neighborhood library. Here's my two cents on the movie. Let's start by saying that besides Qi Yu-wu's KS and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here from the note seems to be a Eurasian. The love interest is a Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and Wong's trio of friends are all, there, Eurasians. Keep this movie the stereotype that falls in love and associates with Eurasians more "in" than the usual Chinese (or whatever Asian race you are?) I don't know, it certainly looks like that. Also, everyone in the movie speaks in a mystical "anglified" accent that doesn't exist everywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's the kind of "semi-perfect English" that authorities want us to talk to, but that doesn't occur anywhere, says the MTV Channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film is forced and silent, not helped by the lack of bloody Singapore in the cast. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter seems to be too difficult to draw one-liners after one-liners. After twenty minutes, the "white" of the movie starts and the movie starts its regular board clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I think I didn't enjoy the movie because the whole premise of maintaining a love affair over 16 long looks incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other amazing things in the movie. I can't believe KS (played by Qi Yu wu) would fall for one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene where the groom says, "Go before I change my mind," is used in hundreds of East Asian (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.) TV series. <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The production value is fair, and Wong Li-lin is trying her best, but she is not helped by the writing. Joan Chen has a 15-minute part of the film as the older Wong and may be the best actress of the lot, but hey, her role has just come. <br /> <br /> If you're talking about "The Leap Years" in the rental or library, you might want to pop it for curiosity in the DVD player, but otherwise, for people who don't enjoy the romance genre, You decide if it's a mistake.
