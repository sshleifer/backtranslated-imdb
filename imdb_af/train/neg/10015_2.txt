Ghost or Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s teens in the turbulent movie. It's not a horror or science fiction movie. Plot refers to a group of teenagers who are about to be kicked out of their hot rod club because they can't meet the rents. As soon as they kicked out, they decided to try an old Haunted House. The only saving grace for the film is that the "Ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature suit) appears to be a working movie monster played by Blaisdell.
