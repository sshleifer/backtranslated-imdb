Last night I decided to watch the prequel or I will say the so-called prequel to Carlito's Way - Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005), which went straight to DVD ... no wonder ..... this totally. And I mean totally S% & KS !!! time to watch it and I think it will be a pure time to write about it. I don't understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh # t-fest of a movie. a fact that I type my hat ... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante .... reminded me how De Niro came in Brando's shoes to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro was wonderful and even got an Oscar for it! Jay Hernandez, he's good to try to be a young Pacino ... Too bad for him. I don't think he'll play more in film and that way, after watching this sh # $% movie, I sat down. off and look at the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
