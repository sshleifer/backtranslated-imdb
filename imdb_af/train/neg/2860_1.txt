This movie only has a 1 because you can't give a zero! if you have a poor stomach, look ONLY. animal real people you also don't want to see. it makes people vegetarians i swear i saw it happen! The only cool parts are the case and the fact that it is a real story. it's really super, creepy that this guy worked at ADT while killing people! still feel safe when you bump into that little code? I do not! He has access to every code in Kansas !!!!!! I hate the movie, it wasn't scary, it was mentally scared! Do yourself a favor and don't buy or buy this movie, I think it costs about $ 20 to include it on their paid actors !!!!
