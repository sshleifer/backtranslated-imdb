In the show Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF KOMEDIE and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. I found it somewhat difficult to believe that Renard would have started as a frustrated obsessive sports lover to be out and about psycho. <br /> <br /> The character bow is not the only problem with this font. It also lacks a character focus (a problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been great, but ended a little flat), for several parts of the movie I thought Bobby Rayburn was the main character , the story switched to Renard again. It also seems to be disappointed with many sports fans who seem to have concentrated on baseball a bit more. I am not sure if it was obvious to appeal to baseball fans, but again there are elements that can hint at if the producers have made their minds, to whom and what the story should focus on. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I am entertained by THE FAN (especially by the soundtrack), but this is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid-1990s characters are being pinched by nutters as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, SPACE ENTRY, etc. of steam a long time ago
