As a family member who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place, but with a bad performance. Stephen Carpenter's writing / courtesy freely borrows from other, better films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give up; enough to say it wasn't nearly as well handled as in the two superior movies. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller stars as Cassie, go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and ex-girlfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being pursued by two murderers (?) In transparent masks. She survived the wreck, but while attending university, visions of the hospital trial and dead people reappeared and disappeared, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? Who lives? What is really? <br /> <br /> Soul survivors have the appearance of a bad, done-that-gore-filled, blood-spreading, body-stacking teen exploitation pile. It probably has its share of the killer-victim scenes (plentiful, repetitive and mental), but tries to build ideas rather than cliches, unfortunately rather unsuccessfully. It worsens confusion much more often than cohesion, because the story is mumbled, messy and incoherent close to key points of the mystery (predictable as it is.) <br /> <br /> Horror fans who upload a copy will have no idea have not. They are in for a movie that is more concerned about building an awkward facade of reality than delivering a body number. Credit goes to Carpenter for the attempt to create something outside a derivative teen horror movie; too bad he created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves kudos to show strength in the central performance, actually creating her character and a sense of emotion than the unraveling of Cassie. It's great that the filmmakers try something different, but the movie ends with a mixed bag and failed experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
