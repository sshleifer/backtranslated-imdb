After reading a lot of the comments here, I was amazed that nobody acknowledged it as basically an exaggerated remake of a 1960's Twilight Zone episode called "Mirror Image", starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job creating an effective, ghostly story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this boring snooze. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but in a feature film there has to be a little more dust and the story has to make sense. Unfortunately, dust and sentence are missing two things from "The Broken." Yes, it has a few moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Still more observations: although it's clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the movie has a cell phone! And even if a car accident is the story that goes on, there's never a reference to an insurance company, the person driving the other car, or the police who had to report. My advice: Skip this drill and look at the original one!
