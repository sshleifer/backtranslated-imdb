I will not mention it terribly, but will not shine at all in this movie, and it is doing a serious, incredibly basic plot development. It starts out well, but once the main hit is done, it is transmitted in a long subplot to a young girl who is not compelling and some action scenes that are theater of the absurdly unrealistic theater. For example, there is a long shooting at the airport where the lighting is all stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is that an airport store will turn on lights that become confusing and just enough to make Snipes its incredible escape? This is one of too few action scenes underlined by ceaselessly drawn set ups that just fail to draw one in the suspicious faith. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole premise is that the United States CIA team can shoot the spot, but get away with saying "national security" to the British. This pennant relies on a stereotype that is far from reality satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies out there. Better formulated, better executed. This one is sometimes entertaining, but there is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes straightforward boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
