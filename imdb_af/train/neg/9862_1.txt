I couldn't believe it if I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I'd have a good laugh as I played D&D for half my life. I had to turn it off if I had a company and they wondered what the shit I was watching. <br /> <br /> It was finalized later and I just had to go to the soft core gay clown porn in the beginning. No, they run the spectrum of fiery jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dress like kKK. This movie is flat for anyone who ever played D&D. <br /> <br /> No wonder it looks like Real D & D will not allow them to use their game. Who wants their name attached to this?
