I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but came to Showtime on this movie last night. The movie looked great with the set design and cinematography, but the screenplay was stilted and timber. The acting was pretty bad - thought the two female leads were usable. You never believed anything that the supporting actors had said. There were the stereotypical Bible immersion Reverend without a hint of nuance, authoritative captain, hot-headed soldier, etc. It is a pity to say that based on these shortcomings I immediately clocked it as Canadian without knowing that it was. Telefilm Canada Credits gave it away. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something in the beginning, but the hostility to the girls is never explained. Here they are occupied in a fort by werewolves and the men waste time and energy to destroy two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is a bit more of an urgent situation outside of your walls than if these girls are lesbians or not, it's just my inference to the hostility that is aimed at it. If they can push and fire a firearm, you can do as well with them. The question about their "immortal soul" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> Also, do I think this is related to the rest of the trilogy, are these girls supposed to be the lead players? One of them killed the Indian man in the end who saved one of their lives. I think one is just a victim of her condition, which cannot be blamed for her actions, but the other is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happy end.
