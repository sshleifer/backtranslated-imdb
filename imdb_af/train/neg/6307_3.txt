I'll give it a 3 just because it shows history we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments of the UK gentleman. The movie was pretty terrible. All clich√©s, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies are abundant. Look at the technical specifications on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you'll see what I mean. I am now his black history month in the US and I will be called a racist just to say it, but the history of this ship is not that good. They did some guiding work, chasing a "submarine" that was apparently a mole they mumbled. Sorry, but black people did much more in World War II, then this silly movie gives them credit. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name start calling, I can handle it.
