If I have to score this movie on a linear scale, I have to give it a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was entertaining, and there are several good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> The psychiatric candidate James Bishop joins the St. Andrews Hospital assigned to his resident, and is delighted and eager to change the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of The movie you know the hospital hides an evil truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and not recognize it. <br /> <br /> The story builds pretty well, you know all along that there is a truth in what the patients tell of some people's evil, and wonder when and how James will discover it. Even when the break comes, James is hunted in a way by evil, and you feel a tension until the "battle" is over. <br /> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girl who comes at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements, and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> The character build is actually pretty good, you are introduced to most people who are killed, some of them you get to know. </ br /> <br /> The movie is an unpleasant scene, it's also done pretty well. There are mysteries revealed in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James, is very credible. The story of an eager student who starts working is good in this environment. <br /> <br /> What the death of this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of 'Plan 9 from outer space' type bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Bad acting (or probably takes very little when filming) - The main characters sometimes act badly, and sometimes well. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I thought "I can make such a movie with my home video camera" throughout the movie.
