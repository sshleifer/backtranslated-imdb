It really impressed me that it was made. The director / writer / actor must be truly charismatic. I can't think of another way to leave it. What I want you to consider is that ... while watching the movies, I was sorry for the actors. It feels like he's in a comedy club where the man dies on his feet and sits there, doesn't enjoy it, just really feels bad for him, it's hard to try. I want to know what the budget is, think it should have been low, as the film quality is very poor. I want to write "the jokes didn't call me". but the reality is for them to complain to you, you must be the man they wrote. or a retard. Imagine this in the form of the script ... and this guy illuminated the green. It's impressive, isn't it?
