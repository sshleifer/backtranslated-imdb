All the logic goes straight out of the train window in this British horror movie, which is in the London underground area and plays with the usually reliable Franka Potent (Run Lola Run), playing Franka Kate, a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at a metro station, just to wake up and find she is locked up and find herself pursued by someone or something with killer intentions. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and unbelief are great and there are very few moments that are actually jumping / frightening, but it's just dull. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unpleasant movie that has to stay underground forever and we all need a favor. <br /> <br /> The only plus here is the inclusion in the movie of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, what is better than this? It even includes "Erasmus Microman".
