Not only was the plot of this film confronted with the ease with which the two psychos could kidnap a pregnant woman without sweating, but it was a terrible deterrent to 'misery'. The main reason I gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely hurt me. <br /> <br /> I'm not easily shocked by any filmmakers and always had a love for horror movie, but this movie went too far in terms of violence and torture, just for points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think most people, if they are just the first ten minutes from Hide and Search, will reach for the remote.
