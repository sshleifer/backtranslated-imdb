I bought this DVD set, face invisible and wish I didn't. The writing needed some serious rewriting, as it seems completely without any sense or pole compared to the book. The lighting was horrible, very unpolished, but if only I could think it over. The writing doesn't focus enough on the characters. There is hardly an introduction to different characters that make it difficult to distinguish who is who (especially in the aircraft - no idea who is going when). <br /> <I have long felt that the key to a good movie is to let the audience care about the characters; if you don't have it, you have nothing. There was no focus on the characters - you never got them - who they were, what they liked. What did they do to do the things they do. The range is 5 hours long and is divided into 6 parts. I sigh you wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't describe the characters --- they put many fillers in it. I will say that at least an hour is spent watching their land and picking them up in their LOL planes. (I mean, should we actually see it again?). I would have given it a much higher rating if they just improved our knowledge of the characters.
