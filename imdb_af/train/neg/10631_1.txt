The views of the Earth deemed to be falsified by NASA in this film have recently been compared to the historical weather data for Apollo 11's time, showing a good fit between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records that day. <br /> <br /> It seems that the whole argument presented in the movie is actually the whole Earth's picture a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window. <br /> <br /> I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to demand that NASA's historical weather data be blurred, but it will undoubtedly involve them in replacing each archived weather map newspaper copy and those in private hands still a problem. <br /> <br /> Oh, a response: "Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA's weather data, I want to say, is a beautiful but weak and believable argument. What about the rest of the footage and evidence in the movie? A wise man once said something about screening mosquitoes and swallowing camels.

Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits that Sibrel worked out contradict his claims.
