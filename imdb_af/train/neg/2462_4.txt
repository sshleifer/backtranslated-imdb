Well, I like the gore in this movie - it's genesisly disrupted. Anyone who is with the dentist will know why. The story isn't really that bad, Corbin Bersen's character's motivation makes much more sense than in most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I have worse acting, directing, writing, etc. Seen, but at the end of the day it's still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to enjoying that kind of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly the same as this movie. Just keep in mind if you enjoy people being tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
