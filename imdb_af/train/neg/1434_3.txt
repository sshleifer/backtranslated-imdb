James Bond in the desert? Well, that's what it looks like: Pierce Brosnan was known as Bond in "Tomorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot for this release. Firstly, the two leading keys to the film are both bad, and Brosnan is named in the marginal more convincing performance. With Annelie Galipeau (as Pony, Gray Owl's love interest) we have to fight with a spectacular dialogue. <br /> <br /> The two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the movie is not about aunts. It's about the wildlife of the Canadian wilderness. And while photography can be beautiful, there's no cheat for the harsh reality of wildlife life. Annie Galipeau, as Pony, unfortunately fails to be convincing because I really wanted to believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old on this movie, and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough might not have been tough enough on her. He made her look vulnerable, which of course she was ... but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is certain, she looks perfect throughout the picture. But mascara and eyebrow thickening in the desert? It does not fit well, especially because she only looks like bush trials with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and uses photo ops for kissing close-ups. <br /> <br /> I lived with forest people in the Pacific Northwest, and they simply don't look good and stay so nice while fighting for survival. This brings me to a different point: the film fails to evoke the period in which it was set: the 1930s. I am putting the blame on this mainly on a lack of painting that reveals preaching in spite of dramatic arc, plot points and those small details that can be called by action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script, and his latest presentation, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age", opened three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the comments others posted, but I'm "I'm not convinced. Much potential but mishandled and even perhaps poorly fertilized. If it had a religious film, it would have been, but because it preaches environmentalism, the film remains a bit critical, as it is politically correct. Sorry, I don't buy it all. Amen.
