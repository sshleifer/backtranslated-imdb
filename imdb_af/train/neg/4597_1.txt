Having endured this inaccurate movie, I will admit that it is a more modern story of the story than previous versions. Yet it is so inaccurate and made it so politically correct that it made me angry after looking at it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would probably have been better off, as Sam Houston gave both men's love for oral. I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (a real Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would certainly have nourished in his hungry sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset, I feel that Davy Crockett was the actual Texan, although he wasn't born here. Our unofficial motto is: "It's not braggin" if it's a fact "was made for Crockett. And the last scene at the Alamo where Crockett was the last survivor should be Davy Crockett's greatest offense ever made. To even suggest that this man's giant and seasoned fighter allows him to live is ridiculous. Three different eyewitness accounts kill him amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand-to-hand battles. Finally, the lamb ending with the film depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texans against 700 Mexican soldiers, ended when 1,500 well-trained Mexican tribes were closer. Every Texas schoolchild paying attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle surprised the Mexican army during the siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused that they couldn't form ranks and fled because they were not trained to maintain the border style. hand.
