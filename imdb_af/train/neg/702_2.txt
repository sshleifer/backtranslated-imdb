Daphne Zuniga is the only light shining in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If it's not her, then what other reason to see it. Five college children are reported to set up an old dorm for the expiration date. Problems occur automatically when a foreign homeless man searches, and the group is short of a few people. Then a killer is on the loose. I honestly wanted to say I would enjoy this one. It had a fair set-up, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga in it. The film is too slow, and almost as quiet as a library. Most of the plays are below average, and the "point-of-view" moments are so old news. Award-winning composer Christopher Young made such films as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment", in a recurring line that was made better for a TV movie. Yet it looks higher than the movie deserves. So, except Young and Zuniga, this one scraps the bottom of the barrel.
