Another long line of flashes made by people who think they know how to use a camera is the same as a story. Within 15 minutes, the whole premise is set out in only a few lines, so there is absolutely no secret that eliminates a whole facet of voltage. The only half-way actor is killed 10 minutes in the film, so we are left with stupid characters running to do stupid things. Low budget movies may not have affordable special effects, so the CGI sections are invariably unimportant, but at least were a valid effort. The vestibule is awful, as seen when it comes to the pavement, and the director keeps his eyes open, which is not even the red color in mirror shots. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some rules pointing to Aliens or Terminator. The last action series takes place in a police station, also a Terminator rip-off, with everyone hiding in the one glass office that the Dark Wolf does not break into. In the end, the girl calls the hero a good Protector, but he gets his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other citizens, not to mention a dozen policemen, kill everyone without a decent shot to get. despite an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. But here's the right vowel for bad writing: They could have killed the animal immediately when it held the stripper while its red eyes flickered. Instead, did they arrest it?!?
