<br /> <br /> Get your brewing picks and enjoy this faulty action movie. Speakman's substantial kempo skill (nice swivel heads, decent with the sticks - poor couch!) Is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just screams bad acting. The plot is not half bad; only slightly poor. But if you see this movie for anything other than martial arts, you completely miss the boat. And for a movie that is supposed to be in Koreatown, far too few Korean actors (even extras).
