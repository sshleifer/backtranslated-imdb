I don't remember the last time I responded to a show as emotional as I did to Justin Timberlake's in "Edison". I became so emotional that I wanted to scream in fear, destroy the screen, accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake is terribly overlooked; In fact, throwing him is throwing Andy Dick to play the lead in Patton, or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But it's almost along the tip. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor and he'll be just as terrible in any role. I had problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake made Affleck like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metro sexual lisp (reading literature), his boyish look and emotional expressions coming from something like "The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors", he poisoned the screen on which he was ruthlessly administered, no matter how you cut it. not and will not buy his role as an amateur fair journalist. It simply won't fly. <br /> <br /> But Timberlake alone is not to blame for his failure. Director David J. Burke not only puts him in the (mainly) primary role, but also places him in Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was so good). LL Cool J. I can imagine that one almost physically suffers to see if some of these works interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is an upward nature: the moment any of these actors work without Justin, it feels like a double relief. . A pleasure, if you like. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone, but those ten minutes are unlike their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a fresh air. <br /> <br /> Enough of Timberlake bashing - words aren't enough to do the trick in this particular case. "Edison" is a very corrupt story. It's plot varies from cliché to simple preposterous. However, I admire the motivation for making it, which I interpret as a tribute to films such as "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or perhaps even "Chinatown." Don't get me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same ballpark as these movies, but I can suspend my admiration for admiring his reason for existence, perhaps justifying me. <br /> <br /> The script, in itself, contains some surprisingly bad writing. Yes, it has some decent spare parts, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (wasted here) and Timberlake looks like it's been straightened out of a Dawson's Creek episode. This is your typical, translatable (and failed) dialogue. This dialogue, you think, is being played at the wrong moments by good music. Sometimes it seems that Edison wants to morph a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated by acting, but by the poorly chosen music and variant movie speed (read slow motion). <br /> <br /> Think about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. It is certain that hell has a throw to kill, but the performances are being destroyed by Timberlake who simply doesn't work. In film like most art, if one thing is down, the whole thing feels down. Directors need to make difficult choices. David J. Burke missed the point here. Some of the screens play well in themselves, but overall they don't look like puzzle pieces from different puzzles that are forced into one incoherent picture. And it's not just an exciting puzzle to start with.
