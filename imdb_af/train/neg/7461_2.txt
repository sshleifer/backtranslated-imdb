*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From the many opening points, this fantastic movie sets the record straight: it's a classic. It does not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than `Nursery Cop 'or` Police Academy 7.' The vastness of it left me speechless when I left the kiosk and returned straight to the ticket desk to buy myself another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that only requires multiple views. The first look will surely be with that strange `huh? "Leaving? feel, but do not feel ashamed - this happens to our best. The story is so foolishly clever that you have to wonder about the deaths of his writers. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI seems to be an allegorical story that works at various levels and we learn all about the very important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will first and foremost combat you, but don't give up! Not until my sixth or seventh performance I first began to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of "Corky Romano". And watch out for the unexpected turn at the end, otherwise you may be completely out of the box when it appears that FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most popular criminal. Corky is not a real FBI agent. Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. Surprise the hell out of me, I can tell you so much. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comic talents are unparalleled, as he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Recall John Reynolds 'performance in `Manos, the Hands of the Fate'. Kattan adopts countless multiple personalities and captures all scenes with perfect comic timing. However, kattan is not just about comedy. He is also a master of drama because he controls the audience's feelings with the slightest move of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself, in a way. For example, in the scene in which he enters his brothers' faces, you can clearly reflect the expression of social injustice and alienation on his depraved face. At a glance it is difficult to find a dry eye in the house. <br /> <br /> Authors, David Garret and Jason Ward, are the real heroes of Corky Romano. With a story of such relationships, it is easy to understand why two experienced authors should be employed to complete this ambitious project. Their skillful storytelling and unorthodox structure make "Pulp Fiction" a mediocre Saturday Night Live shit. Garret and Ward's story is so compelling and enticing that it takes you through your hair, swallows you completely, shakes you and spits you. At the end of the extraordinary experience, known as "Corky Romano", you find yourself a different person with different world views and different ideas, and with just one question in your mind: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
