Just totally trash. I am a big fan of the Cusacks, this is the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the repetition, in full and in depth, less quality, their precise roles of Grosse Point Blanc. In addition, the film's role as a political satire fails miserably than too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose. And paying it as a satirical satire would just be offensive, even to chimpanzees. Imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery, but as if it were nothing near Grosse Point Blanc, and in the same league as the (see if you were a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, let's just leave enough and leave this one disappears in the ambiguity it deserves.
