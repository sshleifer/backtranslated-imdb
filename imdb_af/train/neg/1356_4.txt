I am in the first place and completely and confidently in agreement with the user who calls it a "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally presented the film at the show I saw in Chicago. He has been working on the film for many years and this is the first in an intended trilogy. "What is it?" is Crispin Glover's attempt at an art film in the year of those he did by Herzog, Lynch, etc. to conquer. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I heard rumors of this movie, "epic porn movies with all downsindrome directors Santa's Glover". When it finally came out, I watched the trailer online and read the summary and I was sneaking in anticipation. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a great disappointment. If he had exhausted the goofy sh * t, such as the pot smoke grandmother and the dance dolls, he would be left with something much better but only about 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words, just look at the trailer, get entertained and allow it. There are some striking images and fantastic combinations and phrases, but the lack of focus is disappointment.
