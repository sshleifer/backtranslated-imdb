I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even according to the standards of low-low budget mining, this one is really lame. Even on a nudity and gore level, it's incredibly boring (there are some of them, but it's all kind of ... meh). Before the house revolution revolution, it may not even be released theater (although it may have; * played Plan 9 from outer space * in theaters). There is exactly one good (and skill-delivered) line in the whole movie; I suppose they stole it somewhere. <br /> <br /> The acting is one of the worst things I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had some skilled actors, and the rest tended to be ridiculously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors can be pretty much literate. Here, those who do not read their lines like cigar shop indians sound as if they have learned phonetically. And this film has one distinction: it runs badly for most of the movie, and then it is nice crowded for the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I had to pick the actress to play the receptionist as an exception. She's not wood at all. Not that she's good, but she's definitely not wood.) Even The worst slasher movie is generally good for some Puritan meditations on their grotesque offense, but with this one there doesn't even seem to be a moral indignation. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a successor! <br /> <br /> It is so bad and boring that it is actually fascinating in a strange way. I sat through many of the video and wondered why anyone would bother to make it.
