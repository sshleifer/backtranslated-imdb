Gregory Peck's play was excellent, as one would expect, and cinematography is quite astounding, even when playing directly in a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the movie was forgiving and hard to watch, anyway. I tried to enjoy it, but had to move forward so fast in the last 30 minutes. I feel I have a few good hours of mess. If it wasn't Gregory Peck, I wouldn't have fifteen minutes. 10/04.
