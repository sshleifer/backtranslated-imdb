My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs we are. Two hours later I found that I wanted my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this movie basically contain the best points of the movie. There was nothing very scary about the movie, except good timing on surprises entrances, etc. I found most of the "scary" parts to be more comical than anything. After reading other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is considered in Japan is frightening, not scary in the US. My advice: If you're a fan of real horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. I can't really say I would recommend renting it unless you get a free rental.
