It must take me one of the worst on vampires ever seen by men. How can one change such a fascinating subject into a totally uninspiring story? Apparently not such a difficult task ... First, a conditio sine qua non of any vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch. This one has all these things. Too much light - the spots! O my God, why was it in the name of Christ / Judas? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula originated, he was consumed by light (in the writing to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that was almost worth it made to look, near the end of the movie (beautiful dance with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas bend was definitely original, but this is just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third one will have the vampire signature. I love so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Maintenance with the vampire.
