The Good Earth follows a slave's life and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is wonderful, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead. Walter Connolly is laughing as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, like most of the lead actors, that I couldn't listen to. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Hollywood could not conquer their racist beliefs to cast Asians. in the lead roles. Taking Anglos and making them look like Chinese is related to Anglos to put shoe polish on their faces to play African Americans.
