Of course, the film's writer, Steven Greenstreet, rejects Michael Moore of course, but he also follows in his footsteps by using various Moore's propaganda film tactics. Moore has the expertise to distract the viewer from this focus, while Greenstreet is, of course, less skilled. <br /> <br /> After addressing all the issues surrounding Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see the major community complaints - that Moore paid $ 40,000 of Utah's educational funds Mainly promoting John Kerry's campaign and advertising his own liberal movie - Greenstreet has pushed the background while fewer issues are becoming sensational. <br /> <br /> The marketing methods for this video were equally biased and difficult ... to promote the movie by claiming "Mormon is trying to kill Moore". Not only is it ominous, but it condemns an important religion that Greenstreet obviously has personal problems. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all the major news agencies noticed that Moore's visit had come and gone without any credible security issues or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet sat on this movie to start film-making career to the point that he even dropped from film school to help accelerate it. However, this seems to be a serious error counseling, as Moore's visits to around 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 dimmed interest in this rather common event. Greenstreet's assumption that American audiences are interested in this film because of the promoted religious and conservative corners, does not seem to be well founded. <br /> <br /> Even the name of this movie, This Divided State, is somewhat of a misunderstanding because Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bush's re-election and thus seems more politically compatible than any other state. The film section is more indicative of the wave that exists in Greenstreet's ideological differences with its religion and state. As something, I find a humorous connection between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and Woody Allen's hilarious statement in Sleeper (1973) that, "I was defeated by Quakers."
