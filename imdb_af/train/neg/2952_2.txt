Watching just the trailer to Theodore Rex, you'd think it's a bad girlfriend comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a man in a dinosaur costume. It's true, but it's mostly a futuristic story, much like Batman Forever, with its style and strange character designs. It was mismarked, and had to be marketed as a futuristic story, rather than just a lame cop comedy. Whether this movie is unnoticed, it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs are brought back by wonderful technology, and they talk and walk like people. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is killed, he is given work, but he must be with the hardest policeman of all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is up to this irreconcilable duo to solve the murder and it is up to the audience to stay awake enough to make it through this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character, but by the end he is unbearable to listen to. For one reason or another with a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad simulator. He imitates well-known people and accents, and has some real horrible lines. Whoopi blames him for sailing and he says, "It's not my buttock!" Wow! What a puerile, immature line, even for a kid's movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping that Teddy would bite her head of the entire length of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and action take place, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scenes, the characters try as funny as they can, which only leads to uninterrupted straightforward confrontation. The action scenes don't work, because they are too strange and not violent enough, and as said before, the comedy is just a bunch of junk jokes. Nothing ever works here. <br /> <br /> Having a dinosaur / human detective looks like a pretty original movie, but nothing else. Nope! This movie is a great rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Simply replace dinosaurs with cartoons, and set them in the future, and that's exactly the same plot. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and detective released the murder, a tone and detective released the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys just like the weules. The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit finishes the scene is imitating dinosaurs. It's a great rip-off of a much better movie! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a bad movie, not even earned, is straight to VHS stature. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG for gentle violence, language and rough humor.
