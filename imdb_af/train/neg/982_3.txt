The true star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual look to the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, initially by the thought that Dietrich and Boyer left religion to "find" their ability for love. What follows is a great disappointment. Boyer is the only true actor in the production and one feels his torment. Dietrich's wonderful wardrobe disappears. Sometimes her face is frightening to look at - an uncomfortable mask. As a monk, Boyer kept the formula for the monastery's lick (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse). When he leaves his "marriage to God", the reaction of his fellow man keeps the shock and fear that organized religion continues. The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past. The journey that follows is, however, too predictable.
