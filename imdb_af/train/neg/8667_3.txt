This sport is a nice, deep cast, but for an excitement you give better than names actors and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. Most of them were a lot of women who brought everything together. <br /> <br /> The first five listed actors here are women, confirming that it's really a "chick spot" and little else. It probably plays on the Lifetime Network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. By half they lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked here for about 15 years.
