Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rare is the screen smeared with such an inflated headgear of half-baked conspiracy theories, puritic pouting and modern gibberish. Most of the story is at Viciente, a resort in the Peruvian jungle, in Cristian. Think Tolkien's Rivendell meets Star Trek's Planet Baku, inhabited by pursued followers of a not-so-mysterious but surprisingly meticulous cult of love and peace. Thanks to the horrific acting and sticky production design (the rainbow-colored visualization of the mysterious healing "energy" is particularly frightening), "The Celestine Prophecies" look and feel like a discarded episode of the Twilight Zone episode of 1980. Factual errors about Church history and nomenclature are abundant. I can't believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of this. Maybe it's made without his permission, Bowfinger style. May God give grace to the director, scriptwriter, author of the novel and the poor who watch the movie or read the book.
