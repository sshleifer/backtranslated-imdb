A police officer (Robert Forster) in a crime-hidden city attacked his wife and a young boy killed after she was constantly arriving at a petrol station. After the killers are free of gunfire, thanks to a corrupt judge and himself sentenced to 30 days for the contempt of court, he decides to take matters into his own hands with a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled Fred Williamson to join. These Robin Hood types sort out any criminal who is unwilling to prosecute the law, and with their help, attempts to locate those who have been wronged. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big bag.

Actually, don't bother. <br /> <br /> To exit: File under "Forgetful nonsense". Next ..
