Tony Scott directs a player sports movie that has to draw even the non-sports fan. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too damn slow. Well, make sure! Outside, he appears to be an unfortunate salesman (Robert De Niro), while being a San Francisco Giants psychotic fan. Next comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and designated savior of the doldrums. Our salesman has a murderous obsession when the hard run falls the star in the worst slump of his career and the Giants are afraid to crumble with him. De Niro is personally terrorized. Snipes look very natural as the ballplayer. Other notes in the film are: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You're a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and very strong language are expected and you earn your money.
