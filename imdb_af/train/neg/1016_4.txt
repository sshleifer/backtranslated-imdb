The movie itself is not bad; many comments have highlighted the clear shortcomings of the script, but it is viewable. What really gives me the creeps is that people like Justin Timberlake are even selected for movies, and for movies like this. I have to admit that I have never heard the man's name before I looked at it, but the moment he appeared, I was just very annoyed. The voice is shit, the face is a bad rip-off from Legolas, the attitude is terrible, and he can't properly co-ordinate all three of them. He said I was delighted when he jumped after leaving the disco, since I was hoping it would be only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance and this is the main reason I give it a 4. <br /> <br /> I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast ... and can't believe it.
