So the woman and I just finished it despite various threats from us all to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was only very little excitement. The scene was frightening to the point where we actually visited several times during some of the worse plays (for example, the church lady). The dead sister uses paranormal means to contact her living twins, but rather sends useful information that she aimed to scare hell out of her, much like The Ring. Rather, the police must be involved - what I am sure, the earplugs she has found will have DNA over them - she rather plans a terrible plan to get the man who covered her sister's accidental death. I call it a terrible plan because she finally allowed him to kill her, which then faded the movie. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad end.
