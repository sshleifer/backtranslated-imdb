The Good Earth is by no means a good movie, it is much too ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930s, but that wants to see the life of a farmer. It's not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job, but the film has been dragging for too long. I could have shown the end of this movie at first hand. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who doesn't want to be his own father, is exactly like him. Both fall in love with their wives, just as they are on their death beds. The movie makes a complete 360 ​​from one generation to the next. Also, this movie did not have good character or funny moments, it was just depressing things that remained as a farmer over a period of crisis.
