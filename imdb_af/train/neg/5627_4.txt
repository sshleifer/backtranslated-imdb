While watching this movie, it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men. The movie spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man is (except for a heroic moment). For most of the film, the other black men (and black women's black women) in the movie are in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams' character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some visible and three-dimensional supporting characters that are light skin, and some white characters of warmth and dignity. But 99% of black men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. Voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence. Such a horrible mistake, but everything except unusual in the mainstream media.
