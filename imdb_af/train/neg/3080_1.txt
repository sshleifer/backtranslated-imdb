Hey, hey. This movie is so bad it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's struggling for a while. I remember the day I first saw MST. The sun shines, looks like a good day. Then I saw this product from Rick Sloane, which consists of horrible soft puppets that cause devastation in the crappy 80s party land. Kevin, resentful, tries to impress his girlfriend, manage an assistant security guard, fight with harkies and much more in this very bad series of images. No plot or story is needed. Clearly, no acting is needed as the film proves. An army officer and his slave girl will blow you off a cliff, and the brave friend who gets his phone opportunities will tell you, "He has some red shorts." I also hated the old security guard and wanted him to have an accident in his supermarket cart. Just when you think it's over, wait for the Club Scum scene. Ask for road failure. <br /> <br /> After this movie, I recommend you have a good month to regain senses and common sense. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick at the groin to show how much we appreciate this crap star called Hobgoblins.
