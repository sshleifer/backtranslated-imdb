This movie is even a big step in the form of the typical prize released by Bollywood. The performances were terrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, goes completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is also not memorable. And despite trying hard, the female does not lead 'sexy'. Vivek Oberoi is able to get much better projects, while for now Fardeen Khan is held in similar price. But this monstrosity is even under its limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are terribly poorly written. It is high time for Indra Kumar to hang his direct hat. Hope he will never make such a glance again. Future of Hindi movies is now in better hands. To summarize it, far away from celluloid waste.
