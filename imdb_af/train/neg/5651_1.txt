In my life I saw very big and terrible movies. I'm not an expert in professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say about this one. First, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their actions are so unreal that you even want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors are not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing is about these dialogues - they're so paralyzed. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear it. It looks like your 14-year-old son can perform better. I feel this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Saving your time and money will save you time.
