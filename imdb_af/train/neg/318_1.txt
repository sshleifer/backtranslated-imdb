I stole this movie when I was a batsman. I tried to look it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he is so funny, it must be funny." Wrong! I can't watch this heap of shit after the dream boxing / insulting war, where the guy burns with a good singer, causing your opponent physical pain. You will think that the terrible comedy hurts you, is ridiculous, but after watching it, you will know the truth. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a lot of Steven-Segal movies, and I watched Crossroads twice ... but I still couldn't see it.
