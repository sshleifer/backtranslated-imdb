The Minion is about ... well, a minion. A servant of Satan and whose purpose is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. He is a kind of demon that possesses people and when the body dies, it will possess another. Anyone who owns will go on a berserk rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of Templars, who instructed to keep the key away from the minion. The film began a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where a few knight temple pilots flee from the minion. Then you flicker after 1999, where the key arouses somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is at the key, and the movie becomes a long-winded chase between the minion and Luke and archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The movie is just that, a low budget B movie. The movie doesn't have energy, and just next to each other. You will follow the chase, but you will never get involved in the story, deliberately taking ideas from previous movies (especially The Terminator movies). The battle scenes with the minion are tricky because you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior is this devil. It becomes "savvy" a one-man army when it fights a group of temples, but sucks when it comes to one. And it's supposed to stay around long ago. All this shows to show that any sense of logic is just thrown for convenience in the drain. The whole idea of ​​a secret order of Templars, a door to hell, and the key is not well explained. We are just assuming that they only exist. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that there is not much potential for the story, but just enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren seems to want him somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The pronunciation: 2 out of 5 stars.
