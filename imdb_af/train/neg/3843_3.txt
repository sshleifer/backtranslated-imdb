In the days before gore and sex were taken over, true horror movies were made. In my opinion, Castle of Blood is one of the best, although other judges have given it mixed ratings. In a strange way, it reminds us of the more recent The Others, who was in the theaters a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Director Antonio Margheriti again titled his own photo in 1970. Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why did he do that, I didn't understand, although the remake died Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in his own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wanted to adapt it to American audiences. I don't really know. Interestingly, he made the original in black and white and the remake in color. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is an unpublished work by Edgar Allen Poe, which appears in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, owner of a ghost castle, bet on American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) that he cannot spend and survive the All Souls Night in the castle. Foster eagerly accepts the bet, but regrets it soon, as he is witnessing a series of ghostly killings. The ghost seems to come back to life once every few years, but is doomed to reinvigorate the crimes they have committed in life. Lord Blackwood forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed to revive themselves on the next All Souls Night! <br /> <br /> It doesn't take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (depicted by the incomparable Barbara Steele) long to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the end, but will only say that the Castle of Blood is a romantic tragedy, as it is a horror story. <br /> <br /> Comments. This film is very atmospheric, even according to Italian excellent standards. My personal opinion is that they do real horror better than anyone, and the somewhat dull black and white filming just increases it. In fairness, Web of the Spider was right in its own right, even with color and clarity. I loved the deadly shots, something most modern drivers didn't tolerate. Indeed, when Alan enters the doomed castle for the first time, we are treated for a few minutes, nothing more than moving from room to room, the terrible and improper building in his face and manners. By the time the first ghost appeared, the audience was well prepared and ready. There is a wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts, something not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes, very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's "murder" and the dance scene (reminiscent of the similar dance of the ghouls in the 1962 Carnival of Souls) was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few general interested parties will ever hear, see less, this movie. This is a pity, because this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy of Sinister Cinema and am not sure if it can be bought anywhere else. For people interested in this genre, it is a must see.
