Mark Hamill had to feel mighty embarrassed with CORVET SUMMER! This time he uses a new kind of "power" to regain the possession of his dream machine, a bright red "fat". There seems to be another acid teenager the first half hour and a U-turn in the wrong direction. Writing and directing work is done terribly, with a few scenes that you can barely take. You expect it to happen anyway, and you also smell the smell of the late 70s hodgepodge. Just a former newcomer like Annie Potts will steal the show easily and crawl this poor movie of the repo! Her impractical but beautiful personality holds your interest, and it's the best chance to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Markus! I think the Force wasn't with you this time.
