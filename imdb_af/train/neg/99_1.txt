Some movies you upload for a pound are pretty good. - 23rd-century films have released dozens of dark Italian and American films, but although Hardgore has released Fulci movies, the bulk of their performances are like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is not as annoying as the Stink or Flesh. Unlike this, it is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical skill of a Lego building built by a whelk. <br /> <br /> It has been noted elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie previewing The Action in his credit series, so by the time it comes to the summer attacks, you've seen it all. Bad movie lovers will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity errors and the deadly acting. from the role player (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad, made me laugh), and clutching loudly to get into the spirit of things by making a print look so bad, I felt I watched a few home video of a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible things. We all made such things when we got a camera, but common sense prevails and these movies thrive somewhere in our cupboards. Avoid.
