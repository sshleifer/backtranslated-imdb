This movie made me very angry. I desperately wanted to suffocate the "scientists" and invisible filmmakers over the course of the year. Very, very painful to go through. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. The little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​new agey horse sh * t. The worst offenders were the crack pot charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza reminds us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly imply that they live on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes that I basically agree with are presented in such a heavy, clumsy, superior, pretentious, pragmatic way that I had the desire to reject. I think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they took what is indeed profound aspects of established scientific thinking and murdered them with their new age cage. Many of these are based on the error of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. The dramatic passages with Marlee Matlin were amateurish and cliché. <br /> <br /> I'd rather refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent scientific recording: A brief history of almost everything. There is much profound wonder about life and the universe in real established science.
