It's a bit of a first for me, the first time I've ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (big sets, costumes and weird performance), but it could be made by any off-the-shelf Hollywood director. The pacing was very strange, the last third was just spent and waiting for the movie to end, by myself and the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. Come back Tim.
