There is nothing new to me to say: 4 hours people die over and over in the same hill. The cast was sterile, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God goofed. He had to eat a humble cake (if not for the sake of the men who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who didn't related to He has somehow (and listened to a bad version of "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian drugs) hired a real professional crew, threw away all the fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, like the big army of the Indian army, he made decisions terrible for his actors and horrible to his audience. We all died over and over. <br /> <br /> Please don't do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> The next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest he rent more than one Nepalese to represent the team. There are certainly many Nepalese men working in Bombay. The last score was 40,000 to half a million.
