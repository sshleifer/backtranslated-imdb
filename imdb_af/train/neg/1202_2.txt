A dog found in a local kennel is mated to Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family, who recently lost their previous dog. The puppy does not want to make time to make Donald Trump and shoot the Mexican housekeeper, how festive. Just the father suspects that this dog is more than he appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch. So that's the father who has to say the day. <br /> <br /> This late 70's, made for TV horror movie, has little to do with it, except for a bad sense of nostalgia. When I saw it as a kid, I saw it as a tense nail beater, but I now realized it was an adult. I realize now that it is just lame, boring and not really good. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
