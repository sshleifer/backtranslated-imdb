I saw this trailer and thought of myself. My god is this movie for real, who wants to see this movie and at the same time I thought my friend turned to me and said, "We should see this movie." ... so I said I saw it for about 5 minutes, and I was trying to get a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares, but there wasn't even any of them. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The director has no influence. Perspective. The same shots were used again. Again he didn't get excited. The role-play is probably simply said. I would like to see the writing because the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying girlygiggles and bad music. There was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... Well, there was no plot basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their eve with a stalker serial killer. This is brilliant! Hmmm The acting was what you hopelessly expected in an Australian seaport, the main character of the Blondie goddamn that she had annoyed me. her longest line should have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera, she just drew another rude expression. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you want any movie, don't watch It, and if you like me and not have a choice, I wish you good luck, maybe you're melting in a ipod or magazine. Can't believe this movie was made!
