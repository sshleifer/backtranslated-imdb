Someone owes Ang Lee an apology. In fact, many people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee movie Hulk, due to the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show. I finally decided to watch it on the American network yesterday, and wow .... <br /> <br /> RAILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCORRECT HELP <br /> <br /> Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and it's not nice, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descriptive face was the easiest to imitate with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk would be in his non-malignant state like Bruce Banner look. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle, I was ready to acknowledge Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this boring movie, there was an exciting and urgent thing. I said this - pretty convincing. Extensive action scene starting with Hulk breaking out of a delivery room in a military base and fighting M1 tanks and Comanche. helicopters in the desert, then drive an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, just to be trapped on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best actions ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was pretty good. It is not to say that the Hulk was completely convincing. But it does not require much more disbelief suspension than is needed in many non-superhero action films. And it's quite a feat. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end has become really stupid with Bruce Banner's father who has changed into a kind of shaky villain, but the previous long series of action has shunned one of Iron Man's short heroics. . And generally, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really seemed as if the CGI in Hulk was trying hard to convince you that he was truly and truly interacting with his environment. It was definitely better than I expected. <br /> <br /> OK, but how about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... It's boring too! It has only a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is terrible. Perhaps the Hulk looked forward to Ang Lee's version and met others - but it also has his convincing moments. The Incredible Hulk looks positively ridiculous. It had skin color and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer-generated texture. It was really ominous. The lighting, environment and facial effect didn't last 5 years as Ang Lee's body, they looked 10 years older. And there's really no excuse for that. We really live in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie, just as thoroughly as any director, actor or filmographer ever could. <br /> <br /> Worse, the author and director of this movie was almost nothing of Ang Lee's "failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is almost emotional. The general is so relentless, unbeatable one-dimensional that he looks more like the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, both are pretty easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson almost overworked Nick Nolte, although he was only a few minutes in the movie. The Hulk doesn't really do much in this movie, certainly not more than Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly faster, but since nothing really happened, it wasn't worth much. Oh, yes, the villain is just as fake as the Hulk. He is actually much more interesting than a human being as a monster. <br /> <br /> I can definitely say that Ang Lee's version was better. If I ever get the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to put it through to see the good action series, or else to appreciate the dialogue a bit more (more likely, I'll just go to the good parts forward). But there is absolutely no single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing, let alone twice. It's really at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - in Ang Lee's version, they seem to be trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers meant to eradicate the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making virtually the same movie. <br /> <br /> It is up to Edward Norton's credit that he hears himself from this movie.
