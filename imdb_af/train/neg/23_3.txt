I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious as Michael Madsen appeared in a movie I had never heard of, but it was a free bid, so why not watch it. <br /> <br /> Well, my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget that he ever participated in such a shame of a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your writing and dialogues are awful, even good actors can't save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this movie. Too many non-native English speakers play parts of native English speakers, read lines out of a scrap that had to be discarded and not made into a movie. It's amazing how amazing all the lines in the movie sound. The music is terrible and completely out of place, and the whole thing looks and looks like a poor school game. <br /> <br /> I recommend you just watch it, so you'll appreciate other, better, movies. That's why I gave it a 3 instead of the one it earned.
