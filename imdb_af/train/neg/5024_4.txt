There is not much to say about this one. Gammera is a kind of fire breathing turtle. He is left by a nuclear explosion. He heads for ground and begins to build and destroy tanks and other rubbish (oh well, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he is friendly with a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away or pushing him, he places him on the ground. Safe. From then on, we have to see this thin face, and let it run, show up and run away, arrive and run away. For some reason, Gammera can hear this 20,000-foot kid away. Oh well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a man in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to solve the state debt and of course it doesn't do well. They must know that anyway. We've seen many monsters bump into Tokyo. Not to write it down, because they can be fun, but it's not really good.
