If you have enough time to waste it is right. It moves at a good pace, but to pull off this movie should be a little longer with a little more background on the seat. <br /> <br /> The play is OK. Mariana Klaveno if the sister does the best job and is the most credible. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a pretty good part as the man. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, if the woman had a bad part and the reasons for her return to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The end is kind of stupid. Like most of these sitter movies ... there are interesting parts ... but overall it makes you wonder why you are spending the time.
