Like many voices, Origin is a beautiful anime artistic. The music, graphics and the world created are beautiful and it really stands out above most other modern animated works. But if you are looking for more than I have suggested, you are looking for something else. The beauty stops short of its appearance, and when it really amounts to plots and characters, there's nothing special about it. Action is slow and minimal and sometimes people are flat, thin, and don't work realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there ... So, in summary, oh my good, I've never seen an anime so beautifully like this one; and oh my good, it's like ... speech people don't do that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few steps back to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately there is not even that much action to do for it.
