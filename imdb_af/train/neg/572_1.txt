Ugh, what else can I say if you? I rented this movie because it was marked as a successor to the original Vampires. This movie couldn't have been a misery. Lack not only in plot, but the play is horrible. Combined with a few obvious plot holes, this movie makes a very difficult one to watch. Many times I asked my own common sense to keep the film long after the plot jumped the shark. Here's a sample of the lamer aspects ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professional "Slayer" insists he sleeps outdoors at night. He wakes up to a woman crying and not sitting more than 3 feet in the middle of nowhere. He immediately went to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seduce him, and he makes it happen with obvious results ... <br /> <br /> One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a Vampire, but as long as she did " experimental pills "she has in Mexico City, it is good, although her body temperature is below room temperature. <br /> <br /> Waiting outside the monastery where the hero stays the night, is killed by vampires, leaving the hero the next day. . He came back a day later to just be surprised that the vampires attacked the night after he left. <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
