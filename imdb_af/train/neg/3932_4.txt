This solid little horror movie is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is pretty routine things, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive; In fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real abomination comes from jail, and Renny H. does not save any details to show us how bad the conditions are within the crumbling, leaking, rotten-infected old cavity (with a sadistic officer!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual starring, supported by some very authentic prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this role.) Horror fans should look out for this one.
