Live! Yes, but don't kick. <br /> <br /> True story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station made an announcement that they would be sending out a new reality show. A game earlier. The main participant in this show would be a woman who would die of something terrible and she would donate her kidneys to one happy person with progressive kidney failure. For actually. <br /> <br /> The country and the international media were flying across a story like a maze, saying it was terrible, indecent, what-is-this-world, and so forth. In a way I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As the months passed, the tension built up to some extent that the government was mostly concerned with whether or not to run this show instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> The show aired and until the last moment they pushed forward. And until the last moment, the country was in arms, the prime minister making speeches, every newspaper writing about it, everyone in the country holding their breathing. And the network is pushing. On the way to a new border in television. And they certainly managed to do just that. They pressed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show broadcast and we all looked at a terminal sick woman who had chosen the right candidate to receive her kidneys so that he or she would live while dying shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it was revealed to be a partial hoax. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, with the publicity and the ads and all the discussions built up for a fantastic climax for months, was a publicity stunt to address the problem of big deficiencies in organ donors. The man who established this particular network himself died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now it's television. Leave everyone far in amazement. <br /> <br /> Don't give me a poorly acted, poorly directed movie about a woman trying to get a Russian Roulette show on American TV. <br /> <br /> As axis. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I'm going to believe they'll get it through the FCC. As if I were to believe, it would be obtained by the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I would believe the ridiculous end where this woman pulled it off and had conscience because someone shot him on the air. <br /> <br /> It's all done before. See Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it had a half good end. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a terrific piece of film, along with a ridiculous ending. So that she eventually gets shot, is it supposed to let our movie go, does the public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Don't use my word for it, but I'll say it: leave this one alone and look at a test pattern, you'll get more quality.
