If there is one movie that is worst this year, it's TASHAN. The first promo gave an indication that the movie would be a boring Dhoom 2 style movie, well, I only knew it would be a bad movie, whatever it might be. it's a Yashraj movie Or maybe see the cheese promotion. But this movie gave me a shock, it was even the worst of Dhoom 2 and what I expected First Saif's launch to be boring. Then meet Saif-Kareena, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor o God, what does he do in such a strange movie? What kind of role is it? What is he doing? His first scene is good, but then his act repeats and he overworked. Then came Akshay who gave some nice scenes, but then the movie became more boring and with all the obsolete childhood, overdose childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The end is another joke <br /> < br> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have 3 more films to direct. If this movie worked, it's yashraj's strategy, just nothing else. So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap film makers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br /> <br /> Shows Akshay Kumar comes in the movie as a nice fresh air. He actually offers some interesting moments. Saif Ali Khan is annoying, Kareena is just as bad Anil Kapoor hams excessively and spoils the show even more. Rest is good
