When I get to IMDb board, I'm always tired when I see a "worst movie ever" post. After watching this movie * I think I'm going to create my own post soon! <br /> <br /> The opening titles: big, a kind of lame zoom on a gas oven (yes, focus on fire = explosions = big action-packed movie !!) <br /> <br /> The actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a good actor (sometimes, I sometimes insist) but Steven seagal like a policeman he plays is ... out of words. The rest of the cast is ... Well, I don't know where the actors are hired, but jeez !! I think my dog ​​would be a much better actor than them! <br /> <br /> The plot: Hyacking.original is not it? <br /> <br /> The action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I told myself, cool! At least there will be some nice fireworks. . I was dead wrong. The rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rental stock shots taken from the Air Force. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are hilarious, the music is pure shit, the end is happy (I mean, I was happy at the end because the movie was over!) <br /> <br /> My cousin watching the movie was happy (I'm 22, she's 42 ... well). was about to take the movie and burn it. Maybe I'll see next time ... (which never said?)
