I originally saw this movie in the theater when I was 10. Even at that age, humor was a bit offensive to my adolescent intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past, when I was Ed Edley Jr. would see if jeff goldblum i will cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. Until today I was reminded of the existence of this movie, I wasn't sure why I felt that way. Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie, but my negative feelings to two of the perpetrators remained. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie, but unknowingly teased the pieces of my soul that were stolen, not eaten by the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I wasn't brave enough to try and watch it as an adult. I think I, as part of the healing process, should probably confront this fear of childhood so that I can really put it behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea either.
