Although Frank Loesser's songs are some of the best that Broadway has to offer, they become Joseph L Mankiewicz's deadly action and uninspired performance - when it is over, it hardly feels that you have watched a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to present Loesser's challenging but melodious melodies for maximum effect. For example, one of the best numbers, the performance of 'Adelaide's Lament', ends with Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual "Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat" has its back in the chair while standing there. Mankiewicz hone all the fun by leaving static scenes too long and his dialogue (adapted to Abe Burrows's stage book) has nothing of the white that has his films like 'All About Eve'. Part of the debt must go to the leaders, just about everyone who is miscarried. Marlon Brando looks confused as to why he is in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a good man and has nothing to do with the edge. (The songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons hardly records the way a Shirley Jones can. Just Blaine, like darling showgirl Adelaide, commands attention like a Broadway pro. The colorful art scene was created by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol.
