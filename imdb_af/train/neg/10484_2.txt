As an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this project can be done. By far the worst Elvis movie of all time, totally indecent, stupid and many mistakes about The King. Does Elvis's grave come to a public park? A Survey on Suspicious People in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the throw are trying their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as a mimic). The Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing Elvis sucks. In general, the film is not nice and it gets rather boring minute. If you want to see an ultra-cheap, insane but absolutely funny little movie about Elvis, I really recommend you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
