I only saw this movie last night and, as someone who has very low expectations to start, was still disappointed. The most notable mistake in this horror of a movie is that the main plot point (the man was awake during the operation) had nothing to do with the outcome. It would have ended the same way regardless. So what was the point? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice cases against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a chance. Jessica Alba is quite talented and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish. I'm pretty sure if you can feel someone who is cutting your chest with a scalpel, you will have more pain than that.
