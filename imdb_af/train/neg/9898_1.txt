This version of "Moby Dick" insults the audience by claiming it is based on Melville's novel - even as far as showing a fake first chapter sentence rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael". Except for John Barrymore, it may also be the biggest example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would go to review and change a famous novel just to devour its chances at the box office. All the novel's beautiful, poetic language has been completely eradicated, and Agab has changed from a moving, blasphemous, obsessive man to a staggering, incomprehensible hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance (!) Departs from him his wood saw the bone. Added to this is the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself, and another end!
