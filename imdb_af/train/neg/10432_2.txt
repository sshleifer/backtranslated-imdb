Terrible end - and I can't believe Moore spent a year on it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, who claimed Hubbard in just three weeks. It was actually disappointing enough for me to throw off my chips from the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours was action-packed, though absurd in the premise, and then it worsened to a slow, painful, sophomorous breakdown of the series. Incredibly how slow and drawn that last hour was. Will we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism, I would read Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. Absolutely to think 38K people will give everything for a "new start". Absurd to throw in a missing Kara, and a revival Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial evening. Not absurd.
