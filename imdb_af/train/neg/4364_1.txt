I find it hard to understand why this piece of undamaged garbage is repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humor is also appreciated. She is a definite plus, but unfortunately, it will take a wizard to save this garbage. However, she must be positively acknowledged for her heroic effort and true professionalism. Can't say the same to her star Lilith with her kermstem that stings on your nervous system. It was unreliable and gave the impression that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. Everyone said, apart from Ariauna's performance, it was indeed trash.
