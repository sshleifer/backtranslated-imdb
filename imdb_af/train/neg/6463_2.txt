I watched Free Money last night and it was the longest 90+ minutes of my life. With such an intriguing scroll I really thought I was doing a surprise - especially since I am a Brando fan. WRONG! What a waste of talent. It's almost overlooked to sometimes look (like the beef scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups (why didn't they show Charlie Sheen's character to pull Brando's truck?) Ugh. It tries to be a slapstick comedy, but I didn't buy it. Skip this one. Just for the tough Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worse movie ever made was Skidoo.
