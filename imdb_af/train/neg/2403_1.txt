Whack !!! I did this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out she was in two short scenes at the end. Other than that, I was the fast forward button all the time. Some teenagers go to Romania with his father and are bitten by a wolf and are in a werewolf if there is a full moon. He killed his father and friends. About 30 years past, but he doesn't get old and writes in high school. There he meets a shy teacher who he finally bites and then has children with her. This movie sucks and I don't recommend it to anyone. Read the war and peace earlier. Only Mrs Hartman did a good job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one !!
