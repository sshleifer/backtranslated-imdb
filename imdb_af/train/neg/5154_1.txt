this is the only movie I've ever come across. bad acting - bad plot - bad decisions - bad direction - bad cinematography - if they made a bad picture, they couldn't have done a better job. I hope they are proud of their turkey. I'm surprised that anyone associated with this movie has ever been hired in Hollywood. Don't waste your time!
