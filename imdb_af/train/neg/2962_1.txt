Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. So Whoopi Goldberg can do movies. But Whoopi AND Dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of Theodore Rex I came to one conclusion: this movie is angry. Angry, dirty, angry and reprehensible despite the audience. Nothing bad is accidentally made; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> In the first place, Whoopi doesn't make good action flicks (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers don't "Don't mind - she's a tough policeman again. <br /> <br /> Did you see a million police officers this week? Well, here's number one million and one, mate. <br /> <br /> Don't like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since that Spielberg TV show about them? It's a pity, here's another one, and he's also a policeman. <br /> <br /> You're one of those people who hate car hunters, shooting, messy dialogue, boring futuristic FX and talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write-off ? A GREAT tax write-off? <br /> <br /> And you read this review completely to the end. YOU DESERVE a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one. And if they really make a successor of Theodore Rex, Hollywood deserves to attack a lot of clever cracking rubber dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now I want to pay to see it.
