I had high hopes for this indie that experienced the many thumb reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here's my additional "two cents" for the already published, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is stuck in a dusty little town where he meets delicious Scarlet who works in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help relieve the beautiful Scarlet from her trailer's life? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? NOT. What about those shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if he had walked into Harrods. Then he is bowled to a T-shirt rack to confirm that he has never been visited by any beautiful Scarlet in any store. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as joy in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and ex-hubby battle scene where her survival, a car in this case, requires her to physically attack her ex hubbie. Walk Freeman to her defense .... nay ... he is in disbelief, and quite impossible to handle such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that a car wash and a new, very revealing, sturdy passport is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless stage talk, where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to some stage-related Freeman experience, was annoying. <br /> <br /> Freeman rightly pointed out that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she is facing: uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, VERY WEAK, no family support and a lifetime of low self-esteem. Scarlet teaches such life lessons from Freeman as: Some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse can open doors instead of her lack of training and white-collar work skills. In the end, Freeman Scarlet offers a little more than strange distraction with a 'star', and does not even pay for guest for Scarlet's death of the night returning to her unchanged life in a town called Freeman. not know.
