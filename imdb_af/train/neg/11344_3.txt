I was very unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it's probably worse than both titles. First, I didn't have the animation, much Saturday morning cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella, were mediocre. Cruella was really shameful in the original, but she lost her quality in the successor. What she said was nothing to write home and her animation was so ugly. Also her artist companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have stopped smoking overnight. The voice talents were very good, but especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined it. There were a few good moments, but the whole plot was up to me, and very suggestive of an extensive TV episode. All in all, a very disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60's Disney movies with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give it 3/10, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
