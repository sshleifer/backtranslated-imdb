I have always been a good fan of Woody Allen and will always ignore most of what he has done in the past, but just a blind lover, how boring, meaningless, pretentious, and mostly terribly acting, is this movie. A detached mental masturbation based on conflicting grounds. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate an alleged Allen actor was that he was 30 years younger than Will Farrell's mouth and gestures that Allen would have done in Farrell. The outcome was of course ridiculous. And not to speak of the dialogues ... intended to be philosophical reflections, changed into an involuntary mockery of intellectual consideration, unaware of its comic effect. How sorry ...
