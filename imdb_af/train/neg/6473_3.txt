As a child, the first installment ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time. I believe this movie was like most sequels and did not exceed their original. I think I feel possible in this way because I have high expectations and I grew up. However, this is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel just gave birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eurselas's sister), so they build a large wall around their house, which is on the sea. As Melody grows up, she starts to wonder outside the walls where she is forbidden to go. Trouble as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give any of the movies, so you should see it to find out. I thought the voices were the same and again wonderful song. I think it's a good family movie though!
