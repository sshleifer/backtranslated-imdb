This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's nice to laugh. The dialogue can be incredibly ridiculous and poorly acted upon (eg "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any battles are more or less surreal. Make sure you look for Brock, the regular white man attacking the main characters. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best guys in the movie!
