Just in a very rare case, an episode of the x files cannot get excited. Or the episode contains everything just boring to look at. A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are linked to the presence of a small girl who was there when the deaths occurred. Muller discovered a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues came back as the girl, and is an eternal revenge. Now for the bizarre bit. The little girl has no connection whatsoever and seems to be just a random person chosen as the reincarnation. I think it was a bit lazy writing by the authors and this episode is one of the worst in the x-file history!
