Holy crap. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. All the performances are good, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A lot of the clowns are talking about this and it's your movie. U ... Robert Duvall's character is nervous and keeps the same people on the same papers over and over again. It earns him the same reaction over and over. I'm pretty sure this movie came up to six because people think they should like it. Good performances with well-known and well-known actors, but the real work is a steaming maze. Well, maybe it's a bit deceptive, because steam that jumps from a fresh hope sounds a bit like something happens and in this movie nothing comes! bag
