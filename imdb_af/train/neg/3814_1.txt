I can see that little girls enjoy this show, but it's ridiculous to call it a family show. I'm amazed at how well remembered it is after all these years. It's a very indecent and dull show about the widow's father of three who lives with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend of the school, and others other than the seasons continue. All the plot lines generally have a very stupid lesson. In the middle of every episode someone is angry with someone else and every episode makes them up and it ends up with a light indecent joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the father with mother responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one-year-old joke, something old that is a cartoon voice and acting like a child, and he is terrible. John Stamos was the most acceptable character, but he was so clicked that it was difficult to see him. The oldest girl, DJ, at the show was a really bad actress and never showed emotion. The middle girl Stephanie was too clich√©d as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed how bad actresses were the Olsen twins. You can always tell when they turn them off. The plot lines for too many story lines were so unrealistic, it's worthy. It is a "family" show that has tried to replace any good stuff with gift and love, and even though it is necessary for a family show, they have too much to convey. It will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 min.
