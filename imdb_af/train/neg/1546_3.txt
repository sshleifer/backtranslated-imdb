I rented this movie for a couple of laughs. I have never seen the SNL shit, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, could it not have been so bad? The answer: it was. This movie was hardly a way to relax after a hard day at work. I just waited for a plot line and a funny part, but there wasn't any. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Thieson, and that's just about it.
