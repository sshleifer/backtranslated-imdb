I have Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was cute in American Gothic), but unfortunately she didn't have a very big part in this movie. It starts well and the pace moves nicely ... but by the end it gets a little boring and boring. It's not to say it's a boring movie, but it's just average and nothing spectacular. I didn't have the "posession" side of it and there were no decent gore scenes. Plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the end didn't make much sense. However, I kept the story around the Gothic girl and how she got angry at her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I would not particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it's nothing to leave yourself behind.
