It's not Michael Madsen's fault, he was almost not in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All the other actors are unknown. When it looks, it feels like a soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual overtones, as it is about an underground S&M killer. The acting was bad, except Michael Madsen's parts. He seemed to want to laugh. I hope he paid well for this lousy movie. This is something I would not be proud of. It's not even a B-movie for the cable, it's more like an F and it should never be shown.
