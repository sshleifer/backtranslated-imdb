This movie. . . I do not know. Why would they take such an indelible character as Pippi Longstocking and throw the extraordinarily charmless Tami Erin I will never know. Why would they spend money on art guidelines and some non-bad special effects, don't bother to change it right, I will never know. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes, and sometimes bizarre, why they instructed such bad songs, why the writing doesn't make sense (even on a fool, child movie level). . . . what do they think? Nothing about this movie is like it should be. Each part is called (and always weak), each sound effect is slightly wrong, each change is in the wrong place, each view is bad in some way. It manages to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it never captures the magic of Astrid Lindgren's creation.
