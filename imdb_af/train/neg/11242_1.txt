I watched this movie at a free sneak preview last month and I went out. It was pretty terrible. In the process of trying too hard, they overworked and made a terrible movie. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors had made proper choices in the past, so this one couldn't be that far from the point - but I went wrong. I was hoping they'd be recording at the end of the movie so I can tell them they won't release this movie. I was attracted by the free aspect of the preview, but it was a waste of my time - and usually I am very easily amused. It tried to be innovative and creative with the shots, ideas and filming, but because they had so many ideas cast together, it failed. I'm not usually picky about movies and I usually don't feel the need to show my views on movies, but I had to warn everyone not to see them. I registered on IMDb just to tell you all
