Whoever made this movie should have done it as a joke. I mean, this was the stupid movie I think I've ever seen !! A killer snowman is terrorizing a small village? Give me a chance. Love it when driving the police car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, rent it. If you really want a horror movie, hell goes away from this one!
