Spoilers ahead if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I would almost recommend this movie just so people can really see a 1/10. Where to start, we start from the top. <br /> <br /> THE STORY: Don't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people understand the mysterious events. It's a drastic, basic, going to cabin movie without intensity or "trouble". <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY: I usually give credit to those writers, it's hard work when you start ... but it's crap. The story is flat - it gives you the whole movie emotionally. The dialogue is extremely poor and predictable, saying: "Woah, you completely missed me" and "I wondered if you want ... if you want to ... do you want to come to the cabin with me?" That makes me want to cut off my whole hair, one string at a time and feed it to myself. <br /> <br /> THE FEATURES: HOLY POWER! Some have described the characters as flat, I want to take it one step further and say they actually have an inverted character bow. They start working on a parallel universe and start almost backward ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They already take poorly written characters and add drama to horrible high school. The "Woah you have completely frustrated me" is so monotonous and slow - as it has been plunged. I could only spend hours complaining to the actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight-year-old will be disappointed with lighting on this movie. Too shady in areas, also bleached in others. The director should not use light as emotion until he learns how to fix a basic scene. Baby Steps! SOUND: How many healthy guys do they make a very brilliant sounding movie? 9. With those very good guys it must sound great, but the opposite has happened. There is especially one play that really sticks out, these guys drive in a car and the sound of the car changes with every corner of the camera .... SWAKING! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I run out of complaining space ... rent it - I dare ... Rent it and learn it ... give it a 1 rating .. it deserves it . <br /> <br /> Sign ...
