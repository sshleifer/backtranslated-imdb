The plot was very interesting, with the Russian revolution background. I also enjoyed Budapest if the film was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The love stories were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was very stiff, almost freezing. Rob Stewart was rather charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister, rather than his girlfriend. The end, when we finally realized who was actually to them, was pretty poor and didn't have any sense. I think I would have enjoyed this movie much better if the relationship between the two actors was slightly more credible.
