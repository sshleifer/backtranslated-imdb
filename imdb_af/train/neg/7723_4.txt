Well, I couldn't even enjoy this movie for its cult values. It's a B-movie movie, by the director of "Commando", but it's too lame and stupid to consider it a good B-movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> It's a '90's flick, but the movie has to be reminiscent of an 80 action movie, when this type of B movie was always high. These movies have always gone over the top and have never given much attention to his story or acting. It was all about inflating things, big muscular heroes and bullets moving around. This movie has all those ingredients in it, but I really didn't like watching this movie as much as I would like to watch a similar kind of movie. Hard to say why really, since the story and acting and such something is just as bad as in basically any other genre movie of the same era. <br /> <br /> This is probably because the movie is often far too stupid. All these movies have silly moments, but this movie is just full. The battles, Dolph Lundgren running over shirtless, the characters, the story. It's just not very good, because it is often too lame for words. The story at times doesn't even try to make sense and what's even the most important plot line of the overall movie? The story is all over the place and looks like it's just written to make a movie that doesn't make up for the fight against rows, gunfights and anything like that. And those rows aren't as good to really look at. The moments are far too short and very disappointing to really watch, from the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> It is especially a Dolph Lundgren, in which he will play the big action star, who kicks with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. All of this also brings us one of the worst montage empires in action movie history and certainly one of the worst sex shows I've seen in any movie. Both are just too lame for words and just very weak together. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really work out. The good guys are policemen, but they never look like one. They simply kill without giving responsibility to anyone and they are not very eager to do any arrest or to inform anyone of their discoveries. Not even when they find out that a major Japanese crime syndicate is trying to get to the streets of L.A. take over, and a beer brewery works as a cover for a drug factory and large-scale drug smuggling. And think about it for a moment, what is Brandon Lee's overall goal in the movie? The movie could easily have done without him and the girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame and simplistic and just not enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
