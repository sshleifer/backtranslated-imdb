I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I looked at Polyester and really hated it. The only thing I liked about this movie was DIVINE. She / He had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. As a whole I would not recommend this movie ...
