I had two reasons to watch this swashbuckler when it was broadcast on Danish television yesterday. First, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and I wasn't disappointed here. She looks pretty. Secondly, by reading the movie, I got the impression that it contains absurd humor, unlike that found in Philippe de Broca's films. Unfortunately, on this account, I was disappointed. I predicted the jokes (apart from some witty comments on the subject of the war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were done in a strange mechanical and uninspired way, without any sense of drama. I looked up to the end, but I was very tired and just sat there waiting for the screens with Lollobrigida.
