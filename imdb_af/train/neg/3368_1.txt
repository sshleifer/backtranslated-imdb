For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and have never seen the Robert Wise 1963 production with Julie Harris, this remake will look bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have it, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), Goofy computer enhancements, and a further step away from Jackson's story doom this remake. <Br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and hire the original movie. It still scares effectively without hokey special effects. The acting is professional and credible. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, the 1963 follows much closer.
