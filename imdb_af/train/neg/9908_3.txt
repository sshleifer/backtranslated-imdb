I gave these 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and inexplicable, and because of the deceptive scenes of someone who eats in a very disgusting way, plus scenes of dilapidated looks. <br /> <br /> None of the above should be shown in such a graphical manner. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot, as it is, relates to three detached stories that do not conclude satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First, we have Dylan McDermott, who looks good as a criminal who flies to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter, driving through a border town and a sad salon girl played by Helen Hunt, watch. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, not sure which one is playing a western woman on the lonely border who is going to look at a neighbor, an attractive redhead that we soon realized, was a little too long in the bathing countries. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the movie returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene in the film completely out of rational understanding.
