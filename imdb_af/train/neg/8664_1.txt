It's just a joke of a movie, they killed me at the opening scene (Spoiler Warning) dangerous creatures in the cage. It is watched by a scientist working on a monitor and guessing what she is doing; jumping a fish tank with a big white shark because it has eaten your goldfish ... Pleasant useless and even thicker And I won't even talk about the movie, because they're not worth it. why didn't they shoot the man who wrote it, it was a mystery to me right away ... And this kind of folly continues the whole movie. Just good thing where the CGI is better than average for these low-budget movies. <br /> <br /> If this kind of thing doesn't bother, go ahead, be warned if your IQ is more than 60. will probably hate it.
