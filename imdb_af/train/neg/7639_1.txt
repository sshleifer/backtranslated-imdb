I watched this movie at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. First and foremost, the way it was shot was very much; it is a very slow movement and excessive arty close-ups that seem to have no sense - story wise or aesthetic - except to show the skills of the film artist (which I also believe was the director). This film looked like a prospective film student would come. Chief actor (Sam Levine) was definitely very cute, but at best was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the role play ranged from about to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I have to admit that most of the audience looks the movie; Laughing and sighing constantly, but I didn't like it very much.
