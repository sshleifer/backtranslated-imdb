I just saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and didn't really remember her, but she did a good job as a naive girl who posted pictures because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> She didn't really think what she did, even if she left the business and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The photos she made were definitely tame by today's standards. It's funny that men with cameras all get excited, and politicians pontificate about the ills of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) played an excellent role here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) has written and directed an excellent biography of the most famous pinup girl.
