SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> The Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what action is there! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and more. These are stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy's. <br /> <br /> It's a remake and I didn't see the original but didn't really care about this one, though Bassenger and Baldwin have a nice screen chemistry. But the movie itself didn't do it for me. <br /> <br /> The Gettaway has really become very difficult. The plot is overshadowed by one fight / chasing another and if the violence stops, Bassenger and Baldwin keep their appearance, regardless of the dangers they may have. In fact, by the end of the movie, they look better than in the beginning. I don't think Bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, sure, but it's not very good unless one is an action movie purist I can't really enjoy this movie because There is not much here. The Gettaway is also not terribly original, and unnecessarily cruel to each one, rather to become boring. It really could have been better, I think. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give OK performances, but they don't have much to do except to be pursued. Sometimes less is more, after being seen the same over and over, it becomes obsolete. Didn't enjoy it much.
