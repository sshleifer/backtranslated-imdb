This is the worst ever the TMNT franchise has ever cultivated. I was a kid when it came out and I still thought it was dull, though I had the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> There is this one scene I remember when the mafia monkey explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's horrible. Many fans hate the series to include a female turtle, but it didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her before reading the show recently. All in all, it is miserably forgettable. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was the theme song. Shameful fun, they call it ... Nananana ninja ...
