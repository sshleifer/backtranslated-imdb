Suppose you have been on a deserted island for the past ten years. I haven't heard of Scream and left when Halloween part 1 entered the theater. Then this movie would be an explosion and a completely new vision of the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At the moment, a 2.7 score is on IMDb and it doesn't appreciate that low. If you know what you've done, and I know what you've done, and what-it is, when I reached it to the end, I convinced who and why. <br /> <br /> Not a big surprise, just a nice movie to watch with a cola, popcorn and no urge to get a tough plot, deep characters. If the video rental is from the top titles, you can take it without risk, but don't expect a masterpiece. I saw a lot worse.
