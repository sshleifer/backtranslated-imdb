Actually it had to be this time. Don't misunderstand me, love bad monster movies. But this one was a lot to sow, regardless of the exciting music that never leads you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and the moment she made contact with one of the animals, it was obviously a clich√©. This movie totally reveals the cover on the DVD, which looks very interesting. From the front page you expect a huge monster, but you don't get this cute as big as expected electric eel. Taken to see another movie, The Killer Rats, but it's another review. Deep Shock was really a bit, a big shame given the fact that it looks pretty high budget.
