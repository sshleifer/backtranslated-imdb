I think I was attracted to this movie, both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, and I gave it a chance, by director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) was drafted by police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush). He must be forced to make a gang and go against them to remove his and his family's names. It's really all I can say about the story, since I didn't pay full attention to being honest. Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a good performance because it's worth it, and the movie has the eye-catching moments, especially with a rifle fight at the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it because I got it not looked. Okay!
