This movie left an impression on me forever. I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was alone at home that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor who was a big fan of the "Brady Bunch". I also thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and angry. However, this film made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing Bible studies and church services and trying to change the woman's lives, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people really watched this movie. None of my friends watched it and my family was on the day of the day when I was discussing this movie because they didn't see it.
