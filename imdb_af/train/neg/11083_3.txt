This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting to start, but it didn't convince me as a whole. I'm not a Tyson fan. In fact, I don't like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and doubly confronted (by society) that some get money to beat each other. <br /> <br /> However, I feel the beginning of the movie was OK. Actors, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I don't know how reliable the movie is. I didn't read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about the man, but it was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> As the movie goes on, I felt it lost some of its charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was just not good enough.
