OK this movie is made for one reason and one reason to just make money! Of course, the producers didn't mind killing a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was a pg-13. How many pg-13 slashers became good? It's like asking how many women were on the moon? The answer is NO! Prom Night 1980 was not a masterpiece from the beginning, but it certainly deserves recognition as a movie that remains true to its genre and deosnt, trying to be more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom Night 2008 is the way it handles the killer and I have 3 major issues with him .................... . <br /> <br /> 1) The way he escapes, he was locked up in a spiritual institute and he escaped through an air conditioning guy !! WHAT THE GREAT? why would they have an air-conditioning box in the patient room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2) Its intentions are somewhat uncertain. The murderer wants all the main victims to be killed family and friends so that he can have herself. He says he loves her, but the next moment he tries to kill her, so he also wants to kill. her, her love or just her rape ?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He was a former teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the biggest victim's boyfriend while she is basically sleeping on top of her and she doesn't notice, it's stupid 2 stars out of 10 terrible, stupid, stupid attempts. a horror movie
