Anyone who has watched a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing to be brushed out of the planning table. So, when Lara passed Patti's home and eventually managed to manage her housewife's bonkers, I didn't even sound like that. When Lara finally lifted her activities to threaten poor Patti and dared to do something about it, I just nodded. You see, at Planet LMN, people don't do the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action. Only on Planet LMN can anyone almost own a house that is thrown out of their own house by their seductive powers !! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much and Lara took her medicine and then there was a big battle on top of the stairs that contained a syringe full of deadly stuff that was finally injected into someone's stomach and went out of a lift box front door. The horror! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You have to see it once, just for the big laugh you will have. On the Improbability scale, I give this movie a 95/100. Make a large pack of popcorn and also get apple slices. You will understand later.
