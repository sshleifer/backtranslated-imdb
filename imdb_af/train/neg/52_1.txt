I was excited to see a Catalu√±a film in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was terrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not at all beautiful, is shown in countless films and plays, as well as the relationship between homosexual and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr Villaronga is trying to do is a pseudo-tragedy that belongs to the worst of the film's history. It's really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not advise anyone to look under these circumstances.
