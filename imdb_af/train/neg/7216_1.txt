I love Westerners. I could see them all day. "The good, the bad and the ugly" is my favorite time. I probably watched "Silverado" the 8th time just the other day because it appeared on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst Western I ever watched. The acting was terribly everywhere. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass that doesn't look like. The only good part I can think of is the beautiful cantina girl. The very striking long pauses between the dialogue were deliberate just to make time to make the movie of acceptable length. This movie was not even worth the new rent I paid for at our local movie rental shop. I felt robbed and deserved a rental refund if there was such a thing. The only reason I finished it was because I didn't hate to see a movie to the end. I worked it halfway because it was so bad. For the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another one. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to the West.
