I agree with most other guys. A waste of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is worth writing the paper, was written. The only highlight of my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, Ich must eh Waldsterben") This is reminiscent of the old times with RTL Saturday Night. It is difficult to describe the actions of the actors, as most of them do not even have a good time during production and just do their thing. Camera is right, plot is laughing, I think you will be ashamed even if you discuss it with lots of beer. <br /> <br /> In addition, I've been thinking all the time, wondering how a script like this can even consider it for the production and wait for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was happy, but then he is so happy at this age :-) <br /> Anyway, a 1 point rating here is almost 1 point too much ...
