For a fan series, I have to admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad at all. But reviewing this series cannot be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative in itself is commendable. The creativity too. I think it's people with ordinary work, and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But, do all this work. Pull all these resources. All this time and all the bugs. <br /> <br /> First of all the plays, and the lines are terrible. For most. The dialogs belong in a 70's military show, not in Star Trek. The captain (Squinty) seems to be laughing at any stage. And most characters just read their lines. The directors should be aware of the fact that "repeating" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also recommend that the series be made in the way of Two Takes Frakes, which regulates many of the TNG episodes and movies. Also, I can't help but think most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going deeper. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern about the whole project is the quality of the releases. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why didn't they make it in good quality? Using the fast time format, with low low resolution, is a waste of talent. Even the episodes of "Higres" are considered a bad quality compared to the standard quality range being released. Using Xvid codex, with greater resolution and file size, the experience would have greatly improved. If a band with trouble was the problem, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved it. <br /> <br /> Let us hope that the crew will decide to brush the series, and maybe leave it on DVD and give it the quality of the project. earned.
