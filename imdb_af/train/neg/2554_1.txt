Honestly, I don't even scare when I say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This movie does not have a single our originality in its thin dialogue or its blatant plagiarism storyline. I can't even start counting the number of things in this movie that are obviously ripped off "The Omen" and other movies like that. For example, the girl "Lucy" in this movie is actually one of the devils' followers who are sent to guide and protect the flock of Satan ... it sounds like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage first burned the child just a few months after being adopted, just as in "The Omen" on the ground. Fortunately, one priest survived the lightning and escaped with severe burns over his body .... another coincidence ?????? And above all, the burnt priest remains in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus across the walls, like the priest in "The Omen" with pages of the Bible plastered on the walls as wallpaper. Don't even start to make comparisons between the end of this movie and "The Omen" for you, because as mentioned above, there is too much to mention here.
