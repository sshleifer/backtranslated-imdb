Any National Lampoon movie in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and throughout Germany. It may be an institution in the US, but it is virtually unknown in Europe. to the larger audience. "National Lampoon's European holiday" will be unlikely to rectify the situation. The terrible pigs are just that - terrible. They are not funny. It is clear that Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he's funny. Miss. B.di Angelo laughs a lot at his jokes, but she is paying for it and does not have to pay £ 2.50 for the privilege. The section that is in England is typical. The same guy, the same old TV artists, Messrs. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, me. M.Lippman, the same old, old tired clichés, mr. Chase gets in the hotel corridor. , yawn, yawn. Bucking - ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated that we never saw bitches on bicycles two-to-two ....... rosy red cheeks on the little chil - Dren, must I'm going? The English are buffalo, the French ominous Yank haters. The Germans are pompous and inflated, (don't call the war, Clark), and the Italians' nice pinch. Did I forget something? Every possible "comic" situation is thrown to death, Mr. Chase desperately wanted to, Mrs. That Angelo is sweet, the kids are shockingly bad. The fact that this franchise lasts as long as it does, must bring comfort to those who say you never lose money by underestimating public taste.
