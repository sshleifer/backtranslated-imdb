I agree with everything Calamine has said! And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true. It's time for the girls to move to better roles. I would like them to be very successful because they were a very inspiring couple who are growing up and I want to see them grow as people, actresses and in their careers as well as their personal lives. So producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that moves a bit from the tangent, moving in a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many facets. This movie that is placed is not bad, but as I have seen in their movies, their movies remain the same from typical plot and typography. When Rome is good for younger generation audiences, but the adults who were children when the twins were babies, they want to follow the twins in their successes, so I think our adults would like to see them making films of different kinds, maybe some are like the sixth senses, the hour, the chocolate, that kind of movie, and not just to have serious movies for them, also humor, but rather to see them in different roles than they played in their more recent movies . this one and New York Minutes. (Note: I'm from Australia, so excuse my odd spelling, like recognizing the s instead of z)
