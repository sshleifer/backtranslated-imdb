A boring movie about a boring 50's town. How can anyone think this is a classic? The producer almost finished his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several movies that were far from her acting ability. I think this movie gives insight into how bad Peter Bogdonovitch's future movies will be. Cybil Shepard's career has taken a dive after being in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It wasn't up to "Moonlighting" that her career returned. I thought the acting was a poor version of the "Graduate". I noticed that this movie was not shown in the US. The only place I watched was overseas in Europe late at night.
