This is one of the cheapest TV movies where the characters lose all sentences. The assumption of the story, the kidnapping of a boy's father's son, is very good. But the story just seems to believe beggar. When the mother is advised not to do anything, you know well, she is going to do it. It's a bit far-fetched and not worthy.
