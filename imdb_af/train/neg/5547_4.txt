REVOLT THE ZOMBIES (2 out of 5 stars) No, it's not a lost ancestor of the classic George A. Romero zombie movie. It is a low-budget pot boiler from 1936 which was probably very cool for the audiences of the time ... but is currently seemingly routine. There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing his pistol in a horde of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a needle of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect nowadays seems hopelessly false, but in 1936 I am sure it has whoreders audiences. The story is about the quest for the secret of mind control ... apparently to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for one character to win the woman, he loves. The movie is barely an hour long, but moves at a snail's pace, so it looks like it's a length, believe me! There really isn't much to recommend. You can get some entertainment from the billed studio shots of the star added by a "swamp". The end is interesting ... so I want to say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some five-dollar "4 movies on a DVD" compilation at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth earning the money ...
