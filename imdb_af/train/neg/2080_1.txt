It's easy to see how this below average script took place in the early sales meetings at Regency Movies (and later with Fox): cross the superhero genre with a comical attack on the "fatal attraction" ... voil√†! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the wage was too tempting. An endless employee at an architectural design firm in N.Y.C. meet a girl on the subway and ask her out; Despite being distracted and unpleasant, he eventually gets her in bed - just to find out she's the Big Apple's resident superhero, G-Girl. This angry superman, with powers given to her by a fallen meteor, is not a fantasy heroine, but ... writer Don Payne raised her as a needy, possessive, revengeful bitch. He telegraphed it for miles from us, although Uma Thurman still plays the role of sassy laugh. This is the kind of worthless movie that can't give up an insult. Our introduction to leading man, Luke Wilson, talking to Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by an acid digging at gays (it is worth ensuring that these two companions are strict ladies). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to grind her strength, Wilson is told it will only make her an ordinary woman. And isn't it better? Thurman's early performances in films such as "Henry & June" and "Jennifer 8" showed an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic attitude; Her films with Quentin Tarantino helped her nerve hardness and intensity, but it came at a price (the actress apparently lost her graceful touch). The picture is extremely well produced and shot, with expensive seemingly special effects, but no one bothered to find the humor in this scenario. It's obtrusive, learning, ugly and bad. Inflated, frozen face Wilson can't tell his co-workers that he's G-Girl, because she made him swear he'd rather have a chain saw in his rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought it was hilarious ... or, indeed, if someone was involved? * of ****
