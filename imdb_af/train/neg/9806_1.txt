I can't explain to my life the popularity of children's television programs, watchers. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting children kept this picture in the first place, as the characters look so idiotic and not worth caring. <br /> <br /> The costumes look horrible, like a multi-colored spandex that people carry to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this show anyway, but for children to learn how to fight to solve their problems? How about the terrible hair cuts, and clothes on this show anyway? Not to mention, still play on the cable television, just to make money to teach children how to fight each other when they disagree on a particular problem. <br /> <br /> There is much better entertainment for today's kids, hopefully not as faithful as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. <br /> <br /> How about the gay erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway?
