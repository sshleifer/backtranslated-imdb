Like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I won't expect a masterpiece every time he makes a movie, but I expect the movie to have at least a sorting budget. The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible over dubbing. I know that it has to be done in some movies and I accept it, but when handed over with a completely different actor's voice and still does the movie, it takes away the magic of overbubbling. Also, the sets apparently have to be built, as the slip glass in a top secret lab at one stage has a massive crack. I was really disappointed with this movie and just hope Stevens's next project will be completed before the movie is issued for the purchase / rental. The story of this movie wondered if I watched a sci-fi movie or not, or some parts looked like strangers, but they never fully explained what was going on. I found it very confusing.
