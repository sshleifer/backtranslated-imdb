This movie was terrible to say the least. I was hoping for a lot better looking at "High School Musical". The whole movie was a complete rip off of The Simple Life. It wasn't a reality show. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she wasn't so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was all the way through. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, played a French man, but had a terrible accent. One good thing about this movie was the completely worshiped Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just to keep in mind, if this movie was broadcast for "High School Musical", it probably wouldn't have been so bad. But that was no comparison. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give it a 2.
