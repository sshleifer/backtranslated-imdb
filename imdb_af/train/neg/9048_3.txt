Originally broadcast as an ABC movie of the week. It involves two young innocent female university students who are in a small southern town in a prison camp. They are not allowed telephone calls and no one knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, complaints, humiliation, and degradation that lead to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version was (for his time) grim. No nudity and addictions were pretty tame, but the overall feeling of insomnia was borne. The ungraded version is even worse - there is a lot of nudity, the violence is extreme and in a particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her. Bah! There is nothing wrong with exploitation movies, but this one is just about the edge. You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy torturing and breaking down these poor women - it's all shifted in your face as you should enjoy it. The unnecessary sleeping end doesn't help. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because the play is good - but it makes the movie more difficult to watch. A sick, messy movie. Not recommended.
