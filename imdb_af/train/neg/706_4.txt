The story and the show were good, but it was really depressed and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is wonderful. He really did a top performance, and the girl playing his sister was really great and beautiful. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I am currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. It's a bit too "really" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis' witty little tiffs to the battle of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did. The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to give anything) Sorry, but it's not my kind of show.
