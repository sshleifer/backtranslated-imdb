One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this movie and I decided it was nice. It was immediately after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) dropped his horse from a tree to join the good guy again. I was properly murmured by the entire Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 gimmick who didn't translate anything at all. Of course, the name Coppola in the credits can do nothing to ensure success here, even with more than one listed. <br /> <br /> If you make it to the end of the movie, you'll probably come up. Ask yourself the same questions I did. What was the hook with the gloves? How about the rodeo scenario? Who was the stranger supposed to represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I'm probably going, but my energy is drained. Look, there is already a Western called "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a man named Gregory Peck as the title character. If you see it, it will make you feel as good as watching this one make you feel bad. The one I can recommend.
