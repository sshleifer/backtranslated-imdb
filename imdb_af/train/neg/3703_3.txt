I didn't expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I didn't expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock doesn't show a good deed here, you can't feel his character really. I think the movie would have been a little better if it were drama or romantic scenes, was a lesser part of the movie and more. / Better humor was involved. The movie is like the movie makers have a bad hangover. In the "making of" they do not show a single smile. It's a very bad movie! I gave it three out of ten because of little smile it gave me, but I never laughed!
