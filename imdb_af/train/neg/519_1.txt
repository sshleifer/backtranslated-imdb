At least with the teen geek getting the girl movies, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40-year-old Virgin, he is replaced by a 40-year-old man who is popular with women, but somehow remained a virgin. But then you are not supposed to include your brain with this movie, or have I missed the bit that he has come for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of movies where 40 somethings such as teenagers and women act for some reason find it a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it should rely on the coarse and shallow characters. They did the brutal movies. They did the last, as all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where are they going next? <br /> <br /> This movie is scratchy and rough with nothing to recommend.
