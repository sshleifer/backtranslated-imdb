Another Priyadarshan / Vohra movie is still a movie seen for TP, rather than the real desire. The only reason I saw this movie was the fact that ordinary people were not in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others). had low expectations of this movie. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the decisive overall, except that Rajpal Yadav, who once again unlimited, withdraws, but he has withdrawn all the sweets, but it was that standard slapstick- Original jokes, in reality, this whole movie is like playing the dhol, i mean it hardly takes talent to make loud noise, or even play the weird good knock on the dole for a short while? The only one who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for a long period considered to be great. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the other tool, the Dumroo needs scarce talent, it has no variations. and it may be a while, the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it's not a tool that will keep you entertained for a long time, or you'll dance like the Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played. Sometimes the Dhol sometimes played the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo play alone and the monkey danced. And like any 24-year-old earlier than later, I got bored. <br /> <br /> The movie has good good moments, but after a while everything I've heard is the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerant, then annoying), the big ordinary parts really make this movie mainly good for some funny tracks on "MORE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you didn't watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evening and it's very funny). <br /> <br /> This movie had its moments, the actors did a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can do it, I saw him in Main Meri Patni ??) which is more than just entertaining, I have said it many times and I will say it again. I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good career ahead of them in multi-star comedies. Special scenes were very funny. as the aborted attempts to impress the girls' father, the girl tries to throw the girl away and take her away. <br /> <br /> But after that, there was an attempt to make this movie much more with a puzzle added, which means that when the girl was soon, the next 45-60 minutes became more and more painful was, the climax was "SO BAD MY ALL GOOD CATEGORY" To think if you had time to finish, make an effort to make it tasty. <br /> <br /> The movie is also highly predictable, there is hardly a scene you can't predict and you won't be spontaneously laughing here it is more like you see it coming and starting almost laugh at the gag. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a gradual decline by the movies, except for the strange bump, down or on and then downhill they made friends with the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the very bad scenes were at the end, one the movie trying to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very much outdated and repetitive, the last 10-15 was especially separate and completely flushed MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I didn't really have Tanushree Datta the siren she had to play, and her acting is in serious demand, especially in view of her non-attractive appearance, if you can't be a HOT no. and can't act out how much time you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie was weak, with the constant female look and clumsy lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The songs except the title track were also not good, when the songs played in the 2nd half, I could feel the collective spark of the audience. <br /> <br /> In all a movie that's just ordinary because of the role, and the very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoid it will not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if it has to be watched, watch it for free on TV or a very cheap matinee or something is a must, If you pay full multiplex rates, you will feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> There are many old jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINUTES, and LAST 15 MINS, ONLY technical, bad songs. <br /> <br /> + / - s try to be more than it was, not the regular cast, Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + some great scenes after the start, title song, good acting and throw except RY. <br /> total 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to be objective here, I don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie has met my very low expectations, so I give it the benefit of all doubt , on absolute terms this movie was no more than a 4)
