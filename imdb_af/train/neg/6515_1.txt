It's not a boring movie. The audience can stay on his chair, fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both filmmaker and actor. The storyline is simple: after a divorce and ten years of a hollywood non-career, the author plays a quest for love for the camera. The first question is how true is this: what is written, what happened by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no," portray M.Berkowitz as a low average human affair. If you are looking for a love affair about love like this one, I encourage you to read independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> In addition, I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know American people usually say that the French are arrogant (it can be true), etc. And surely, the French (and the whole world) have a lot of sadness about America, but why did so much hate? Don't think I can just keep this movie from one.
