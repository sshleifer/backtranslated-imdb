I looked at it at school. And to sum it up ... <br /> <br /> Talented actors, talented writers and a talented director. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a waste of time. Don't even see the movie. Don't bother. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it was supposed to be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a little. The film's actors were just bad. The best actor there was the old man and it didn't say much. It's a horrible plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say it had no point. The writing was unmotivated and confusing. There were points in the movie when I was feeding my eyebrows and saying, "What?" Also there were just too many loose tires and plot holes. It was absolutely horrible.
