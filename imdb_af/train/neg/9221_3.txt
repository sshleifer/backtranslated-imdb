All you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid, original soundtrack that reflects the late 60s, and all but a few of its characters are unattractive. Once you get the message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> Davies's protagonist ignores his lovely friend, one of the few people in his life who cares for him. By the time he takes her advice to get her involved in the real world - instead of a fantasy movie of which he is the imagined director - he does it by pushing her and adjusting with an actress, he becomes outside the reason idealized. A few laughs and some thorough art are the only worthy observations here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall of Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying brattiness was overcome, but here it is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family connection clearly landed in this role; here is hope that his choices improve.
