I love Don Knotts, let me just say it in front! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does, portraying a nervous, lovingly satisfying loser in a position of authority. He is fantastic in this role as Roy Fleming, the unwilling Astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, really, although I, as a child, was delighted to watch this and his other films. It's still worth watching, but it's really a movie that is best enjoyed by kids. I want to categorize it as 100% family friendly and something you can sit and watch with your kids on a family weekend. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts films, there is a good role of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky open-mouthed stars no matter how old and scratched you are not. <br /> <br /> From a mature perspective, one thing I think is Great about this movie is how it captures NASA in the 1960s - all the new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was amazed at how suave and studious Leslie Neilsen was. Only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a rather thin, irreconcilable woman who can't give him the time of the day until he gets a big shot. If you're like me, you'll hope he'll give her the turnoff at the end. Beware - you will whistle the theme songs for days after watching, it's so catchy.
