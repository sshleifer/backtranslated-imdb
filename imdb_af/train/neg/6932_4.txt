I waited a long time to see DR TARR's TORTURE DUNGEON and after watching it, I was very disappointed. This is not the Baroque movie I expected to be. The trailer (which I saw on a somewhat strange DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgotten. There are almost no outstanding screens in it and the look is interesting, but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque-style movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are boring and there is almost nothing dramatic, even though we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk - more than anything else. It was almost like looking at a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or mood or something. Instead, we see / listen to the main characters and talk endlessly about dull things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
