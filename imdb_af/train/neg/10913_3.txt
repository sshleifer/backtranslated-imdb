Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a policeman who is his lifelong dream. But his luck changes when he has a car's loved one (a very bad one) and is found by a doctor. The doctor should use animal organs to rebuild him. After this moment, he starts unconscious and becomes a best policeman who can ever be. By now he realizes the changes and his animal instincts begin to take over his human side. Meanwhile, he finds a sweet girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means he has to control himself and act civilized. I'm not a great fun by Rob Schneider. In fact, this is the first movie I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser. (See her part in Ally Mcbeal, quite funny, actually). There are some good parts in the movie, like his movie with the goat. In such movies, the biggest problem is that the writer seems to feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is good to watch as long as it's not taken too seriously. But very sad to see that such films do very well in the box office. The animal is not the worst movie I have seen so far, but fails to get more than *.
