A young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues his scientific research on the rebirth of limbs with flying colors, but his mother, who wants interference and her doctor-lover, sells the serum. If he finds out, there's an accident where Harry loses an arm. So, he tries out the serum and what is a genetically strangled arm that has its own mind. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it so many times before, but what highlights these camps and a little rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually, it's not a bad movie by Fangoria movies; there are better people out there who are similar in the veins. "Paid Tires" simply does not have its own distinctive style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter looked like 're-animator' and even a slapstick like something from 'Evil Dead 2'. <br /> <br /> The cartoon is really furious with its black humor, but it can be melodramatic and a bit dry in the fun factor. Surprises are generated, especially the movie's final outcome. It was well accepted, as I thought it could be locked up with something more accessible. For a low-budget production, the FX compilation can look good and goofy, but there are a few grotesque moments that will make you smile rather than actually ring. Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story, thanks to Elke Sommer's strictly juicy performance as the mother. Oliver Reed is a very humorous death team in a bad sense and he pulls it out very well. They were both immense distractions as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is beautiful in a volatile performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano quickly moves the film and orchestrates some attractive scenes of gripping and bamboo-like horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's youthful and basically stupid nonsense, but you have to give it a go for some unforgettable entertainment.
