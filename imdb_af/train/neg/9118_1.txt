It's, literally, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This could be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad they are good; This movie is so bad that it goes past pleasant camp and just becomes unwaveringly terrible. This is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention of disgust, and my whole family came together for a fun night with clever remarks; Instead, we struggled in silence, with poor Peter Sellers sorry. <br /> <br /> It's worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the Matrix successors. This is worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should you approach this movie within 10 feet of your television.
