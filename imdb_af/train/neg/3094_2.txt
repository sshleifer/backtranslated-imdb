**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad filmmaker, I watched hundreds of bad movies, yet "Hobgoblins" are separate from everyone else in their own unique way. Classic bad things like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are uniformly bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand, start getting worse and getting worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake battle scene, I thought it was a very bad movie. Luckily I was unaware that I saw the best of this movie. The movie takes its most massive nosedive in celluloid hell during the painfully unclear "Club Scum" series which is a continuous rope from one infinite joke to another. With just one movie, director Rick Sloane proves he deserves to be named as one of the worst directors of all time along with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane. How bad can a bad movie be? See "Hobgoblins" and no longer wonder.
