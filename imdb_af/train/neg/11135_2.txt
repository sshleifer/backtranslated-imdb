What else can I say? The acting was almost without exception amateurish. The direction and continuity was unfortunate. The scene play was predictable until the very last scene and the dialogue was boring. One of the features on the DVD was called "Gag Reel", but it could be a description of a viewer's response to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most amusing things was in the director's commentary on the DVD. He said with a straight face he decided to make a movie with high production value and a name story - and that he succeeded. With such disorder, it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The dark wolf pack was a custom aappak (per the 'make' feature on the DVD) and looked at it earlier. The mask and claws were a little better than those of any costume shop. The effects were painfully obvious and of a quality similar to a cheap video game.
