Why is it that any movie about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh, makes the worst in movies? Whatever the attraction the woman has for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Ceasar, and his successor Mark Anthony, never seems to be on the screen again, except the fiancee of high school seniors. Despite exaggerated sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any Italian "sandals and gown" extravaganza of the fifties. This kind of spectacular belongs to the big screen, so Gladiator did well, but "Gladiator" didn't have the romance novel. Mrs Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has the talent to save. Sorry, some of it wasn't on the other.
