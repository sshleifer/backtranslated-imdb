Everyone involved (and the audience) should look for "The Candidate" to see how well this movie could have been. What happened to the South American story? What was Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking of allowing their roles to be cardboard cuttings. Until now, I liked to keep every Gene Hackman show and / or movie. He was either interested (which I can hardly believe) or terribly mistaken. I also loved and defended Richard Gere (and for sure). But here he had no "power". He was never intimidating and only occasionally convincing. All in all, I was very disappointed. I really expected and threw more from this director. If you don't see the "Candidate", watch "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
