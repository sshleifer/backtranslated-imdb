What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It's starting out well with the title set, but it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> The movie is something about rats that turn into monsters and go on a deadly spree. The play is not bad, but the script is pointless and the film is not even in the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really great that some groups dirty and thought this bag. It will make a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's trash, and I encourage you not to waste a moment on your life! One in ten.
