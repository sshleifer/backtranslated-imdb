From the beginning, the political theme of this film was so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is completely predictable. Any good handbook on screen writing will include the layout of characters, character characters, and three act structures. In this movie you will find nothing of it. The police are the bad things, and are therefore shown to be shallow, incompetent and cowardly. It does not seem as if the makers of this film prevent police from being honorable citizens who see themselves joining the police as a good way to contribute to the well-being of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his mind whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film arrested him to steal a horse, but we got no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the doorway, but just know he's been in for three years when we hear it much later in a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie contains many shots of Ned who are looking at the camera with a serious expression. I had the movie a real job to watch. This is the direction of modern films, and this one no longer made me look.
