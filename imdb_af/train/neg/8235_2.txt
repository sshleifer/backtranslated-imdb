As horror fans, we all know that blind rents are a shit. Sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we find that the movie we just spent on our hard earned money is nothing more than a turbulent steamer made worse by the totally undeserved rave reviews and movie festival awards the box. So is the case with Five Across the Eyes (a title I am sure is a dual entender that refers to both the movie budget and the coercion anyone looks at who may have used all five fingers around their eyes <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what the * ahem * writers think, manages for, centers on a group of teenage girls who unknowingly decide on a backyard late at night after leaving a soccer match and running a crazy woman playing cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls in her car found to be a fender bender in a petrol station. <br /> <br /> In fairness, this is an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines. It is in the performance of Five Across The Eyes that this idea falls flat. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its bones approach to the material, but also manages not to be. What we get instead is excess scenes of chase, torture, release; chase torture, solve in that order for 94 minutes with long intervals of bitch, groan, and incoherent rambling acting as enough intervening intermittent sequels. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the movie is incredibly grainy and dark, which in a better-made movie could have improved the tension and realism. Here it is just annoying. The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard to find anything to sympathize with them. One character stops to get a first aid kit and tends to have scratches on her face while shooters have heard in the background that her friends can be killed. Another girl avoids hilarious stupid lines like "Don't go out there, she'll get you when she gets you, she'll kill you and if she kills, you're dead." <br /> <br /> It was a grant from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that forced me to watch this one. Talk about a false orgasm! Perhaps I would have met my expectations if it were in the comedy section. I'm all for a low budget India horror, but this one takes the crap cake. Give five eyes (or FAT; get it?) A pass. <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 five-cut cuts
