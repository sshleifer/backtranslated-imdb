Most of the French movies I saw and enjoyed were more talkative than action, but that's good. I found them interesting, well-photographed and intrigue actors. (However, at one point I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film ever made! It was.) <br /> <br /> This movie has the same interesting footage and had a good opening. But then it talked, talked and talked more .... good for a drama, but not for a murder mystery. After a while I almost fell asleep and looked. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie was more like a play with almost all the screens played in one room. So, if you love plays, so much so ... but I want a little more scared of a murder story.
