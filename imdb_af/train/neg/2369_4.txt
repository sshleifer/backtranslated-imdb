Sixth escape Freddy Krueger in which he finally managed to kill virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizon and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do so. <br /> <br /> A failure as a horror movie, because it's not scary at all. Work better than a dark, macabre black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger is now uncovered of all his ability to chew this viewer. (Too many wisecracks, that's for sure.) The actors aren't interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and a distinctly sleeping Yaphet Kotto) and there are far too many visual effects. The final is OK, but don't give as many sparks as I think. <br /> <br /> With the addition of a new twist to the well-known dream killer's story, Englund offers the opportunity to do more non-makeup. plays than ever before. <br /> <br /> There is a remarkable comedy: a joint has come through then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold, who is without entertainment value, a fit by veteran shock link Alice Cooper, and a funny comedy by Johnny Depp who also acknowledges the puppet icon he has become. <br /> <br /> Film debut by Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about This is the repetition of key scenes from previous entries during the closing credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
