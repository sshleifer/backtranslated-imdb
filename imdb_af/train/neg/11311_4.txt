I remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the 60's. I did several interviews and bios of obscure actors / actresses, especially Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at a low-key Sci-Fi franchise in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a fun conversation with him and his "career" and life. All these are published in a long forgotten fanzine of the day. Wish I had more copies of those interviews, but time trials, and any one of those people will certainly not remember me so many years later. Ben was a very good man and gave a life gift. (The disadvantages of those days didn't even pay their guests unless of course they were big names, and even then the wage was a few hundred dollars! Good to know that Ben is still alive and kicking! How a reminder of the Creation, but 50 years older! Ugly, uglier now!
