This move is about as bad as they come. However, I was forced to give it a 2 for the scenery. There are huge shots of the southwest, including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the US. It also starts with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, one scene with Kris and the girl was filmed at a place called John Ford Point.
