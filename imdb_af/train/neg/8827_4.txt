I love the 80-year-old flashes and remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" of our theaters was drawn. I was very disappointed and I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. You better watch was what I expected from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous according to today's standards, the character development too long, but it was generally very funny! <br /> <br /> The screens where he loses it, because Santa, aka Daddy, feels his mother and later when the crowds actually show lighting torches - not flashlights like you would have wanted in the 80's, but real torches! - I really cranked my funny leg. But the screens where he looked at the children in his area gave me a terrible feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to find out who were some of these character factors. It took me a while to find out that the main character was the lovely teddy bear on brothers.
