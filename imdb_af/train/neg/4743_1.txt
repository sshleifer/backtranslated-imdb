I'm here again in your local shopping center (of course, because that's where the high school kids are bursting out !!!!!) to demonstrate how terribly "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" really is !!!!! To prove how bad this joke is from a DCOM, it's ... <br /> <br /> ... we're going to take these four sumo wrestlers and tie them into this camera. How ... cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hey! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How terrible is it ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel flushes its money away, again, with the exciting 10-second promotions, which the viewers wonder: "When is it up? And then, suddenly, when it comes, for one, it doesn't just get it" a higher TV score than usual, but it was only seen once !!!!!, no !!!!! Once all !!!!! Plus, this movie is about high school and things, and believe me , I will NOT go with what else is in it. <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile !!!! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs 0/10
