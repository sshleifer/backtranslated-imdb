What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something. Guy Ritchie, a director renowned for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites more than he can with this one. <br /> <br /> His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a free-man man swallows his pride, is nice to his enemy and gives away all his money, falling flat on his face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta, it seems Liotta is crazy enough to blow his head into the final scene. Why? Basically, you can't set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character, who supposedly came to his station by displaying the kind of relentless behavior that was visible through the movie, first to give him suicide by nothing else as a pitiful smile on the face of Statham's character. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying I miss the point ... I'm not. I'm getting it right? Relax from the search for wealth and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Love your enemy and it will confuse him in self-destruction. It seems to be at the heart of the movie and in itself it is not a bad point for a story, although it is not original. The problem is that Ritchie just doesn't have the skills to make a movie maker. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realizes it, he seems boring with the story and starts importing red-billboards. The scene when Statham is beaten by a car. Why? Shooting some scenes as Wonder comic animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose threads and unanswered questions at the end of the movie you can get already 2001-ish about it and try to find out, or simply accept that there are no answers and every viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous toes of the movie I just didn't mind. Frankly, the end could not come too soon, so I no longer had to go through this pretentious psychobabble. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours of my life.
