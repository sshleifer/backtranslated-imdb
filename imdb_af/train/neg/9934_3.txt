As a casual listener to the Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, as this film is much of his age in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 1980s) it just seems to me as a hippie purist propaganda crap, but I'm sure this movie wasn't made for me, but people who were active during the 60's. I looked very similar to the Stones, I was disappointed. It actually showed real life, hard work in the studio. So much so I felt like working with them to put an end to this god's horrible movie. I didn't see any of the directors other films, but I suspect they are following a similar style of 'amatuerish' which puts a sense like the TV show, Eurotrash, heavily targeted, careful and lacking in real entertainment value. My only good opinion is that I didn't spend money on it, it came free with a Sunday newspaper.
