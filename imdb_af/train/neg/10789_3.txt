If you're expecting to see a lot in the Altıoklar bath, as promised by the tagline, you'll be very disappointed to see that the movie is nothing but the populist style of Altıoklar regarding most famous issues such as sex, marriage and fraud. Too much nudity, which seems to be out of nowhere and has no connection or whatever is to the plot, proves that Altıoklar was unsuccessful in trying to try something new, as he quoted. Too many sex-centered jokes seem to show that Altıoklar has fallen for the well-known saying "sex selling". I was hoping to see a very good story, telling with a very good narrative technique. In the end, however, I sat for 90 minutes and watched Altıoklar's experimental, but still too much focused on popularism.
