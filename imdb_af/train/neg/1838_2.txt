"Envy" is bad for a number of reasons. Yes, there are unlikeable characters. This is not the problem. It's that they are untenable and we don't care about them. "The War of the Roses" characterized indifferent characters, but due to proper introductions we grew to at least be interested in their fate. In the "Envy" the introduction is thin, the characters are never credible and the plot just makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I am a fan of his work most of the time. Quieter campaign to release this straight-to-video and now I can see why. The film suggests that he is "best friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we get footage that apparently hates Stiller hate Black. I thought it would develop into some one-sided relationship (a la "The Cable Guy"), but it never does, but Stiller insists he is his best friend. "Poo." The movie's plot is ridiculous, but it doesn't matter because it's supposed to be an exaggerated morality story. Unfortunately, the message in the mess is lost. Walken gives a good performance, but Black is indispensable and irritating (and I usually find him very funny). No, it's not a terrible movie, but I still can't believe Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it. It's not one of the worst movies of all time, but it can certainly be much better. . I wish Va-Poo-Rize existed - so we can disappear this movie forever ....
