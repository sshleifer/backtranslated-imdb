One Star. This is all these documentaries deserve. I didn't feel disappointed watching a movie, let alone a documentary, for some time. <br /> <br /> I'm a BIG fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Marvin spin-offs, for all their fun, yet informative information. And although the subject of the prehistoric man has never been interested in me much more than other prehistoric beings, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other documents of the series, I thought I should also see this one, especially after seeing relatively good reviews elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Well for those who made a good review. of this document ... what do you think? lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they could get through was interesting, the presentation failed in all other ways. It had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused on what it was trying to say (with information that was hurt and sometimes out of place), terrible effects (this included the few moments of CGI, and especially the makeup effects), and MTV-style camera effects. <br /> <br /> In view of the make-up effects, one reviewer mentioned here how funny the scene was when cavemen overpowered this giant monkey and how it looked like a 70-year-old horror movie. Well, there are many moments, just as it was, the people who portray the monkeys, were ridiculous and ridiculous. None of these are helped by horrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is nothing of it being pointed out in an interesting or dynamic way, or looks the right way. It doesn't even seem to be taken seriously. It also had no emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in "Walking With Dinosaurs" of the fate of the Ornithochirus (sp?)? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I see it. This is such a connection with the topic that most of all is missing. If you are more involved in the subject and its own personal story, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts about it. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this production is the pretty good story (at least in the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, DO NOT even rent this one unless you want a good laugh (which I regularly did but usually followed by rolling eyes). It doesn't belong on the shelf with the other "Step with ..." documents. <br /> <br /> And does it make sense to learn that this document is NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who are the others in the series? Hmmm ...
