As you may or may not have heard, there is no real battle between vampires or zombies in this movie. One can then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but it's really suitable because nothing else about this movie makes sense either. There was absolutely no story or plot, only things happened. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than safe motor vehicles bad. <br /> <br /> Not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies, even in it. Their make-up seemed to be applied by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and out of place and has one of the characters that challenged the zombies with a hedge trimmer (I'm not joking), but they used chain-like sound effects. <br /> <br /> It was undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I am not completely ridiculous for every person responsible for the production of this film is that I have been produced entirely by 11 year olds. <br /> <br /> But with all the criticism here, I suggest watching this movie just based on the fact that it might be the worst movie ever worth while, and that's why it's quite comical. Even the mistakes in it should entertain you.
