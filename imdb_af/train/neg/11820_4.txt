I saw it on DVD (it is known as CORRUPT in this format) and the blurb on the cover really hyped how Harvey Keitel's character Frank is as much as the one he played in BAD LIEUTENANT in "This gritty and powerful police thriller ". What the casing did not mention was that it was an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music, he does not sit on the CD player, pulls out a large plastic pancake thing, puts it on a kind of rotating hob where a kind of mechanical arm touches the pancake causing music be heard. You see my point that this is an old movie? The DVD case had no idea, it was made a movie 20 years ago. It is also a film with poor production values, such as so many other Italian films such as American children. With the exception of Keitel, the cast is awful although Johnny Rotten's performance is bizarre, rather than horrible, the cinematography is static with the image and sound quality that gives the impression that I watched a fourth generation pirate copy (I don't know if that is a dodgy DVD or if it is a very bad movie print and worst of all is Ennio Morricone's score. It is impossible to believe the man who did the annoyingly intrusive additional music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for that Clint Eastwood Westerns. <br /> <br /> All this is unfortunate, because CORRUPT has its moments. It is certainly not the greatest psychotherapist ever imagined, but it has kept my interest and as always Keitel is a good performance as a violent murderer. Just sorry the rest of the movie didn't meet its high standards
