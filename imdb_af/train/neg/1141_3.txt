With low expectations going in, the opening came new footage (bell for more than five minutes) from 'Mans' as a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't say the new footage was grade A material, but it laid a very good foundation for what a good, all-original movie could be. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was compiled in 1955. , during a time of one day, schedules shoot. After the new footage, Jules White decided to print only a footage of 'Bridal Groom' in the brief. It makes for a not-so-smooth story transition, which Jules and Felix Adler are trying to recover with a quick slice of new footage. end, we give the old, exhausted ending of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) to be shot in the butt. <br /> <br /> 3/10
