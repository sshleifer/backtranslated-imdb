If I'm going to watch a movie about zombie, I don't expect oskar caliber performance, or write on the Godfather level, but I expect the actors won't at least look like their excitement to read their cue cards, and dialogue It doesn't sound like it was typed 10 minutes before the actor reads it in the camera. This movie was just awful, I actually got up and left about 25 minutes and went along and watched Cold Creek Manor. It wasn't that good either, but it looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stack of shit. On the positive side, the girls were very nice, probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes. Indeed, I left after the hottest one died. There was nothing to keep my interest. after that.
