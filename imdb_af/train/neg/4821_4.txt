Fiction film (it's based on a story though it has a "documented" credit) on a group of scientists entering Canada's wilds to find a Bigfoot. (They want to catch one and then attach a shell device). She is very scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in that is really a dull movie of a lot of people wandering in the desert. There are a few attempts to create tension and frightening, but to be honest, there's nothing here to see out of a few wild shots. It's a perfect definition of an exploitation movie, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it yields very little. Recommended for insomnia only
