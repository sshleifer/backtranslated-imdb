An Avent-garde nightmare, extremely low-budget "movie" that delights in greatness. Hard to go through. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow great revelation. I have no idea that it was wrong before you watched it. Yes this is sarcasm. Don't watch this "movie" if you're offended by the nakedness of the male or female sex. Do not look at it if you are the least spoiled. Don't look if you care. <br /> <br /> The second thought, just don't look at the period. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Make the movie, the premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movie stories, director's comments, 2 versions of the teaser trailer, music video by The Azoic, and a classroom video experiment
