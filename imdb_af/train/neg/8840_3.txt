Here's the perfect example of what not to do if you have a good idea. This is the problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the writing and its execution have no real content. It must grab you from the start and then draw a little on your emotions, interest you and invest in the characters. This movie does not have to take off and maintain flight, and here's why. First, you don't really care about the characters, because they are not presented in a way that can endure people. I don't think it's Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's supposed to be about normal people who have a stressful situation. They are not credible as they act and interact. For example, Jeffrey Combs as a policeman over cold is glue, frowning and watching intensely all the time, is not the way to go here. I mean what's that? He looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he plays the intense / neurotic, unaffected medical genius was right on the money. But not for this he tries too hard to compensate by looking so intense and on the edge, but in a quiet, gentle neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised he didn't disrupt his jaw during filming no. The movie is basically life support, it hardly has a pulse and it has been waiting for me for something that will never come.
