Making a movie covering the prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy will even tax a great movie maker. Mr. Lucas is not that movie maker. <br /> <br /> Getting a good man in the darkness needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with just a few pockets of even lighter saber fights, but there is a lack of rand because you already know what main characters survive after the original Star Wars. Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very brief role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent! <br /> <br /> No, the movie just falls with the chancellor who turns on the Jedi and has one big (lump) sequence at the lava trap
