I can't even believe this performance lasted so long. I think it's all part of America's dumbing. Personally, as David Spade said, I knew this show better when it went through its original title - "Seinfeld". What bothered me most about this show, besides the obvious, basic sense of humor and general filth, is the pretentious way in which the episodes are titled. Really great shows are still funny to many repetitive views, such as the one where Rob accidentally hypnotized, on the "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor dedicated to viewers of great programs. That the authors and producers of "Friends" would have the tireless hubris to name the episodes in such a way, before anyone even had the opportunity to see it even a second time, does not only speak of mediocrity and lack. to original thinking on the part of the aforementioned authors, but also of the hidden thoughts of their viewers. <br /> <br /> You read the comments of some of these people and can only conclude that they are in a Hallmark Map-like Neverland, full of greeting card sentiment. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people are supposed to work in coffee shops and find work as actors, but somehow they succeed in $ 4000 / ma. apartments? Really get it. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, congratulations on all that. That New York does not exist for anyone who makes less than a serious six figure income. But luck with all of this, anyway. Now, shut-up and pass the Soma.
