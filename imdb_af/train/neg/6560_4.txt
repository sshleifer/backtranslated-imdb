"Shadrach" was not my favorite type of movie. I found it too sentimental and the acting was under par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not credible at all. I also did not believe that Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially if they had a housekeeper in the house. Their social classes were too far apart to consider this credibly. It seems that the Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that Andie MacDowell came out of a car after having had sex with someone. Who was it? Her son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was never made public again. It was smooth and not at all appropriate in the story. There were too many inconsistencies in my movie. The story about Shadrach was nice, but I wasn't convinced the Dabneys would have been as generous and generous as they were portrayed.
