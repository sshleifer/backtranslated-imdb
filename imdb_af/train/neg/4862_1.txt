This show is one of the worst shows of ALL TIMES! absolutely no original jokes and they are always a year late. As in 2009, they will eventually say something about Michael Vick's dogfights. All the role players are people who wanted to be on SNL, but had to go to the lowest of the low, crazy TV. An hour of crazy jokes jokes. Witch is not funny to start with, told by terrible John Stewart wants to bee. so if you have a problem, tell me, i love to hear the opinion of the 3 people watching this show. family guy played it well "Osama bin Ladin was hiding in one place no one would watch, the movie of the crazy TV. There is a reason why no one is watching the show.
