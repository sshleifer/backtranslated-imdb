To judge by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a wonderful horror movie focusing on junkies. What I got was a full junkie crap. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookers" that reviewed these people? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them wrote or wrote me so well. Basically, the whole movie I just spent shaking my head and wondering about the foolishness of these drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor. Don't rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or another decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! The animated penguins are scarcer and more convincing than anything you'll find in "Cooking".
