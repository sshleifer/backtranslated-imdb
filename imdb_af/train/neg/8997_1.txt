This is the worst movie I've ever seen to watch and with the exception of "They've seen Hitler's brain" the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore I expected to be the funniest movie that can be produced, as it didn't have the limitations on TV improvisation shows. <br /> <br /> The writers have to think we'll have a little roughness, a few flatulence, some cheap sex and hey, we have a risky side-splitting laughing comedy. The game sketch sketches are nothing more than cheap unimaginable takeoffs on Let's Make a Deal with silly brutality. The sit com started with the single girl and her boyfriend was just a bad high school humor. The stun gun ad was suitable for Seasame Street. The LA metro skit was leaf humor with tasteless bloody. The French chef running around blindly said, "There is no difference" with a French accent. Well, you get my point. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase's only funny slit lasted for a whole minute. This means that you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh, yes, I read the comments about the whole country stoned in the 1970s and you will be this movie if you are high. Well, most of the country was not stoned in the 70's. If the disgruntled writers were stoned, it had to be on the clumsy sinus medicine. There were 4 other people in the theater next to me when I saw this movie. Of course, the word did not come out about how bad the movie was.
