If I didn't read Pat Barker's Union Street before I saw this movie, I'd love it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It's actually my kind of movie, it's made well, and I don't want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from all angles. <br /> <br /> The disturbing novel about the reality of In a workplace in northern England, my heartbeat lives and I have refused to let go of weeks after I finished. I was read by the women of Unionstraat through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery. Excellent. A new novel that I sometimes felt I could no longer read, but I just couldn't write a book. Depression yes, but totally gripping. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh, dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and wrapped a layer of icing sugar over it. A beautiful movie, an inspirational soundtrack, excellent performances, a story of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed in Fonda's character, their stories are touched, but many are thrown away. I accept that some of Barker's stories are sensitive issues and are too scary for massive viewing, and that a movie with about 7 leading protagonists is just not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and the real intestine of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced by sunshine, beautiful homes and a shining William's score. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the movie for its positivity and hope in the face of reality, I encourage you to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like "Schindler's List." .. but without the happy ending.
