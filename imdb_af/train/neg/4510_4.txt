I love Memoirs of a Geisha so I read the book twice; This is one of the best books I've read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and was scared that reading the book would ruin the showroom of the movie. I didn't expect the movie to be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book were left out of the movie and the characters were poor with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) the worst. If I didn't read the book, this movie would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The plot outline of the movie claims "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she crossed her fishing ..." Did anyone see when or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
