There seems to be little in the middle of the midfield where Watch On the Rhine is involved. One also loves it very much, welcomes its sincerity, its liberal point of view and fine acting, or rejects its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and overall inclination. I fall a lot in the latter category and find the movie and play - about the activities of European refugees in Washington during war - a crushing drill that is worthwhile, mostly for acting, and even just moments away. That the writer Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she rarely explored ideas that were not kept by the writer and audience, except to show how terribly the "other side" is. Even if I find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she should say - as in Rhine - I still can't stand as she says. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows a particular facility for the way people talk, she has no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I fully agree with the late Mary McCarthy's long overdue dismantling of Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or in extremism and longing for the good old days, I have a look at Watch On the Rhine, as bad as Angels In America, which just shows that the theater had one foot. in the grave sixty years ago.
