Is this the movie ??? Is that what Indians are trying to show ?? I think it's another attempt by a discerning director to dismiss Pakistani soldiers and actually land ... but what our Pakistanis know we are always in India in every part of our lives ... not just in armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... it's badly filmed like Border's early early 1997 ... and the director and writer just tried to overcome Kargil's addiction by Pakistani armed forces by create movies like this. <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... When there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tries to make some good movies instead of Nonsense movies like this
