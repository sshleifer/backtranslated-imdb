You can't keep up with this knowledge that it was made in four days, and I expected it to be champion anyway. (It's not all that is camping in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who don't take themselves seriously, the rest of the wheel play halfway straight, Riley Smith is extremely bad.) The ridiculous story actually pay attention to what kind of shocked me; I have accepted the whole purpose with these ultra-low budget horror movies was to meet the basics of sexual fantasies and not a damn about the story, but they used many words like "technological" and "physics" in the script. get their point over. (Although it is possible that the story is just important to explain why there are so few role players.) No one cares about this stupid story, and the only thing interesting in the movie is the mockery of cults and the soft core homoerotism (which is not all edgy). I would have enjoyed it more if there was just a random murder, for no reason. The film is gritty, with a TV-quality watch and acting level. There are a few "sexy" scenes that are in order - the boys move in the box in their boxers, feel themselves up; or being tied up and making orgasmic faces while wine is thrown on them - and some of them are a little funny. And I love digging at L. Ron Hubbard, and the intended irony of a story about religious cults has told with intense gay overtones, but it's still not good. 10/03
