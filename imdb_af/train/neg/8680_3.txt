I just watched this movie and WOW was so bad. Actually, the only thing that looked at me was that it was so MONUMENTAL, it was kind of entertainment. The actions of the characters are hilarious, from the hyper dramatic way they fall to gunfire, to their incredibly bad acting (were the bad guys all just pulled off the street, or were they actually actors?) Unbelievably bad delivery of lines, to their inexplicable actions (if you try to shoot someone through a doorway when they enter, it is of course the thing you have to do, shoot directly at the doorknob!). This movie should break a record for the worst written and rendered lines. <br /> <br /> The camera work was also really bad - you can hardly see what's going on in the fighting scenes due to camera angle switching and shaky. <Br /> <br /> I would have voted "1" except I like Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I'm entertained by a few scenes: 1) breaking a villain's arm so that the leg protruding from the skin (it must be hurt.) 2) a drug-cockerel eating a brown-eating animal (a monkey?) by hooking a meat nail to the carcass. 3) Sonny Chiba performs some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers out. <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this one is really not worth anybody's time. I saw about 7 or 8 of his films and concluded that the only thing worth watching (and they're great!) Is the Street Fighter series and The Kill Machine. I also heard the Exporters and Golgo 13 is good. I recommend keeping to those.
