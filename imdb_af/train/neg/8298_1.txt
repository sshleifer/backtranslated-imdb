This movie was not very entertaining, certainly NOW as original or as good as a Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors, and they fail. The evil neighbors came out of nowhere because they were not part of the first movie. It really sucked, maybe it was good with the original cast, then maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
