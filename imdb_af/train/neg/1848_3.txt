There are bad movies, then there are the movies that are so bad that they are almost art. This is one of those movies. My mate and I are still a kind of shell shocked, you know, staring into space and drinking! You can say that the people involved (I hope they change their names to protect themselves) have an explosion and they were definitely not ashamed. I give this one out of ten just because of the free smut and VERY bad gore effects. I laughed aloud during most of the movie, so I think you can say it showed me a good time. Beware viewer, the above words never mean it's a good movie because it's not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to give a movie with such a great title!
