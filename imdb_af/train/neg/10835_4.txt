Great throw. Great play. Unpredictable story line for the first half <br /> <br /> hour or so. I really wanted to know what is going to happen <br /> <br /> with each of these awesome characters, and how they will be intertwined <br /> <br /> with seemingly diverse lives. But when <br /> <br /> the authors took out the glue to connect the players, they incorrectly used <br /> <br /> supergum and stopped the movie <br /> <br /> for the last two hours. I thought it would get better, but it just got worse. Don't believe the reviews. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise made ugly - why? The beautiful <br /> <br /> honky bartender wearing brackets - why? I know it has to do with <br /> <br /> the plot, but without them there would be at least one attractive role player to remember.
