Well then. I just watched a crap-loading movie - all with varying degrees of quality. I wasn't too sure which one I wanted to revisit. Then it hit me like a bag-a-rats: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity dies no one and is painfully boring to go through. And it's about mutant rats that kill people. Yes ... actually freaking 'original. "Food of the gods" or "Willard" anyone? It was better than that, and it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Well here's the story: Inna laboratory is experimenting with the scientist and his laboratory on rats and their lab. is in a crappy neighborhood and a crappy building and the brave assistant's moronic friends appear drunk and everyone becomes food for the mad rats and almost everyone dies and, oh yes, there is one giant rat that looks crazy but it is killed , the end. There, all in one sense! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I differ! The second we all realized that there is a huge mess, we all know it will eventually die! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's the exposition: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I watched it for free, but for everyone otherwise ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> Didn't hurt it, didn't help: <br /> <br /> - Well ... well. The gore was decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> - CG rats aren't as bad as they might have been in some shots. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - And in other shots the CG rats were pathetically cheap. Look, if your movie has a low budget, you may not need to rely on CG. Lesson to take heart. <br /> <br /> - The acting is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> - The characters are out of interest - we have a mish-mash clich√©s and none of them are even done so well. . <br /> <br /> - Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Just done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, not stupid. <br /> <br /> - Greedy gear looks like a fat man in poorly-pregnant suits - it was kind of funny - but not funny enough to give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> Edited, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All college student chow people drink Tequila from large plastic milk cans - and yet they seem to be drunk for a few seconds. Away to keep on going, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Simply awful. Worse than you would think. It's not even bad, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead." Now that movie shit you can enjoy. Even if they make you brave. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The lame action movie ends, complete with uninvited heroes and explosion. Because it didn't feel like the rest of the monster at all - but still sucked. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinema: 4/10 Character development: 0/10 Special effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I was occasionally on my film to my son, so I missed it, but was probably there). Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9 / 10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Just watch it if you love rock and pest-based horror movies. Wait ... Make sure. Don't look at it. It's crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
