... but the query here is usually. I knew to worship movies. Everyone thinks it's stupid. But in the world of B-rated movies, this one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies is that they don't take themselves too seriously. The makers of movies, like this one, treat the movie lightly, even if it is a heavy subject. However, I get the impression that the producers of this movie have followed themselves seriously, as they collect a 10-star classic, complete with poor efforts on sharp lines and stupid camera shots. Nevertheless, despite all this, I still have given it 4 out of 10 stars, as I am so biased towards movies. However, if you are a B-rated fan, I will try too hard to find this one.
