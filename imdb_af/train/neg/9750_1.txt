The film, a universal release of a Protelco MLC production, is a boring narrative of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy" and then send it back to a "target area." There is no explanation WHY it is needed, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") thinks it's his and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen) live. <br /> <br /> During an experiment for the well-known Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine failed due to sabotage, he projected himself by his secretary Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to take revenge. Of course she screws up and he comes out like a "pig braai" with the power to explode people. <br /> <br /> With this new power he managed to tie a few Cockney idiots, a security man named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his lab boss, Dr Blanchard (Norman Woodland) . He is also able to break into a pharmacy and also steal some rubber gloves and a black dress. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. Generally, a completely useless movie with no message. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color films you'll ever see.
