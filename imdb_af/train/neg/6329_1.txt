I saw this movie amount in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets were actually sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever come across (with my friend, while the idiot that was the "Laser Bra 2000" sketch) appears on the screen. Apparently, my and my friend's reaction to the movie was a common one. It's not that I found the movie offensive (or 18 years old or now), but rather that it is sensible and foolish, and even unconditionally from the inadvertent humor that makes an Ed Wood movie lookable. This is the reason why NBC refused to air it, rather than having Mr. Not to understand Mike's "vision" (unless his vision would of course be the bank's backlog in bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> Today, I remain surprised that this movie does not look like any published "10 worst movies of all time". It sure makes me. You're warned.
