To overcome the death of his wife, an old man who would do somebody in his position, at least in a Peter Greenaway movie, does: he and his son populate their home with eight and a half (one has no bones) do not start with a sexual odyssey. It's a Greenaway movie, there are many pretentious and uninteresting blabberries and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old man full of frontal? For those who are not in the gay erotic scene, one of the women's horses is nasty. There is no story - just a random collection of dull scenes.
