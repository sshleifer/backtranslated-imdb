A nightmare on Elmstraat: The Droomkind, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elmstraat series and the worst successor ever in the series, even worse than a nightmare on Elmstraat 2. I was lucky to get the nightmare on Elmstraat. DVD box for my birthday and I watched all the successors. The dream child was without a doubt the worst. I was also surprised because they were so good with the last two pursuers. But I think they just lost the charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy with where it went. Alice just got more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her independent movie didn't work for me. Freddy also lost his fright, it just became a little fool. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she wears a child, she can't be happier with her life. But Freddy is also back and he won't be too light on her, as she has defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyway, he wants her child and is born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy also had parents? Well, that's what a nightmare on Elm Street: the dream child examines and Alice soon finds out what Freddy's childhood was and that might be the one thing that can beat him. <br /> <br /> A nightmare on Elmstraat: The Dream Child is just a bad movie and an insult to the series. I don't think anyone can be happy with this successor. Just the story was very stupid, I think it might have worked, but again it's just the wrong way. I know if you want to see the prosecutions for the Nightmare on the Elm Street series, you should see it, but I really wouldn't recommend it. It's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
