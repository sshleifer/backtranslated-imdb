"What happens if you give a homeless man $ 100,000?" As if they were asking the question, they were somehow morally relieved of what would eventually happen. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" are trying to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their fianc√© as a kind of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he turns his life around. Then, with just the most fluid guidance and counseling, they let him go in his cheerful way. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Money can't buy you luck?" "The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or how is it, "Lift up a man - it's more fun to see him fall at a height." They had a man with nothing to lose, give him something to lose, and watch him dump it all in the drain. It's supposed to be entertainment? They pack this seed with bleak music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end it has all the moral high levels of car accident videos. Just this time they crashed the car and asked, "What if you stop taking a stop?"
