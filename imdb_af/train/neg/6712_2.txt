I think you should give a few points for the sheer courage to write a musical to a history lesson, but how about decent music? <br /> <br /> Is the cartoonish play by Howard DeSilva meant to ease the interest of otherwise dressed children? <br /> <br /> Is William Daniels' Contemporary (For Time) Acting Style meant to appeal to a 1960s / 70s demographic? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway audience in jail.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I find the whole piece dated, sowing and the actor too much for the screen
