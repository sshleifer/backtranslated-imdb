Hanna-Barbera sucks life from another well-known property. The violence is watered down, the stories are formulas, the animation is bad, the music is unpleasant and repetitive. Frankly, the show is just not funny. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB was sitting every one. of his series through the same clichéd situations, whether it fits the world of the cartoon or not. So, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular. Put it together, and you can't miss it!"). Also, in a seemingly ripoff of "Private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that they know as new military recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Adding to the annoyance is public service announcements in every episode (standard practice currently for cartoons, but still annoying). Pousies teach his cousins ​​to cross the street safely, reclaim, and - are you ready for it? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I won't make it up.) <br /> <br /> The only charm that remains of the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from early on, continues the role here. <Br /> <br /> Worth looking at once, just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise avoid at all costs.
