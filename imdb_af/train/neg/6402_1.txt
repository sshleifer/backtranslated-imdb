When I watched this movie, around 1979, it became the first movie I ever walked in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just fails to miss, and it misses every time (although I can't speak the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the sketches. While enjoying humor, these sketches were unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more annoying was that this movie was advertised as "Robin William's first movie", and he activated on his new famous fame in the "Mork and Mindy" series. Yet his role has become so little that you can't even see him on the screen.
