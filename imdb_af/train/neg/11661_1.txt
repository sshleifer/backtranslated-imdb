Actually, it's a lump, unfunny, action / comedy. First, I want to say that I enjoyed the Wayans brother Scary Movie (1) and the successor had moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even deliver HALF. <br /> <br /> The humor in it is absolutely rough. If you like burial, pruning, stupid catches, you should probably look at this. If it's not rough, it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the movie drove everything away for me, totally unfunny, simple idiot. <br /> <br /> But I watched the whole thing because I was with a friend (otherwise I wouldn't have bothered). The story is undeniably thin, it was also a screaming movie, but at least the laugh was fast and constant. I think it's probably also one of the biggest problems with this movie, but the laugh doesn't come fast enough. Some jokes are dragged too long when they are more disgusting than funny. If you prefer your comedy with some brain cells, just avoid it. If you want a crazy comedy with more laughter, check out scary movie, plane, hotshots 1 + 2. <br /> 1/10 Totally unfriendly, Thin storyline, A movie based on one idea is (ie what if we dressed as white chicks for a movie?) but simply didn't have enough material.
