We had to go to an appointment, so we switched on the DVR to record the end. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have an idea?" He shook his head no. I said, "So you let me see the end of this movie and I have no idea what just happened". He didn't make me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The movie body itself was pretty good. There was a lot of tension. It has your wonder. Then came the end. The end was ... well, it just ended. You didn't know what happened or why. To the credits I thought would happen to explain it, but it never did. So I came here that someone figured it out and I just didn't pay attention. Nope. Here four years later, I was just as clueless as Tom sawyer. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what's going on. I'm just glad I didn't pay $ to buy it, because I'd probably be angry. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I understand! The end of the movie is what has disappeared! ROFL
