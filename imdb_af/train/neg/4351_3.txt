Every generation believes fully that it lives in the end-time. It has been true for thousands of years. And movies like this feed on it. How did they get the big Orson Welles to tell this train wreck? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link the prophecies as well as possible to what happened in the times it made, which made it of course dated and kind of stupid. <br /> <br /> The reenactments look like they are from "Unresolved Mysteries" but without the high production values. People should have been embarrassed to participate. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is dated, stupid, responsive and useless. Good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually search.
