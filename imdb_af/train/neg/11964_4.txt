Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy drama about fathers and boys, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha), causing him to seek out his estranged father (Alan King), a film extra, who desires him a great star. The writing is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liners in general, a flat, unspeakable direction by Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode) and family conflict on the side. Crystal and King are trying their best, but King is inherited and often over-the-top. JoBeth Williams still has one of her ungrateful roles, but succeeds in bringing her complicated, expectant class to the proverbial friend character. It's a comedy, I think, but one that shines tears ... shameful. ** of ****
