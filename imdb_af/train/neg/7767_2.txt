For anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's Book this film should be interesting. It's colorful, well behaved and shows high adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories, it's terrible. I almost couldn't think of it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, writers' authors seem compelled to rewrite the stories they work on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are a few episodes that will be difficult to film. But why write the story instead of just adjusting it? In this case, the authors challenged themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: There was no mutiny on the Renown. The officers took over the ship after the half-mad captain was completely angry when he fell through a hatchback - for reasons that imply, but never gave. There were no court killings. The investigation court was carried out in an almost congratulating atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, and also spot. Ortega's wife. Hornblower, himself, was never in the brig on the ship or on the beach. There are many such manipulations of Forrester's story. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think the repeated use of the flash device has hurt the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why screenwriters got a good story?
