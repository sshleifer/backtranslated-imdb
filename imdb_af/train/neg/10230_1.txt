On a copy of this happening. Not mine and if I have spent my own money on it, I will find those who are responsible and claim it back! All I can say is that it will be a terrible student life. Any understanding of the medium of film is absent. Because of God it is terrible, the story of the original Twilight Zone series would be rejected as original and reproach, and the change in tone of the main character's response to the 'ghost' is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the "glowing" reviews of this movie are friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even entertainingly bad. <br /> <br /> Amateur in the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
