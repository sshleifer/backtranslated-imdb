If you have a rude skull, throw an empty house, a schizophrenic woman, a crook and a nutzo gardener, a minister and his wife - what do you have? <br /> <br /> AIP's response to insomnia. </ br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" gets points for pride, and offers free boxes for anyone watching scary movie fans. Beautiful safe bet, if you are being let down by people who think they are in a production of "Suspense for Dummies". <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was a tuck shop anyway. She had a few good moments to react here and there (especially when she was trying to communicate with the gardener) and no one else was filling a nagga like her. But the scared face she made - scary to herself. Wiea. <br /> <br /> As a whole, there is little tension here and everything becomes telegraph like a punch thrown by a mime. You can't be afraid of this movie, it's impossible. It has its moments, but not enough. <br /> <br /> But thanks to some Mike Nelson and his two robot friends, there are several moments of sheer joy, especially in the copy they get hold of ("The movie jumped and it was very scary! "). <br /> <br /> One star for "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Talk about a "screaming" drill ....
