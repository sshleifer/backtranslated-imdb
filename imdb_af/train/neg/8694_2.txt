The female head was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She smiled too much when she first went to the cameras to talk about her daughter. It had to have the police suspected. I would have been indisputable in the same situation. She was so calm for a mother who couldn't find her daughter. It was as if she didn't even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the part better. And that would have made much more money for such a controversial important topic. Everyone else was excellent. I don't know where the main actress is, but I hope she had some acting.
