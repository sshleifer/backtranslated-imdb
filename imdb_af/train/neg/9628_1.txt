It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD was given to me for free with an order I placed online for non-DVD related items. <br /> <br /> No wonder they have been given away, surely, no one can share money for this drive. <br /> <How some reviewers say they have convinced it hilarious beggars, the person who includes it in the worst five movies has ever spotted it. <br /> <br /> How on earth is a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman can get involved in this litter is incredible. Mostly toilet humor and bad done at that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid it at all costs.
