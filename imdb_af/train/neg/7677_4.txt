I stopped looking lost at this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's deaths were unnecessary and really depressed. Then I found out they just kept Libby to die in the next episode! Gah! I can't handle it. <br /> <br /> I held this show for the first season, but it certainly declined in the second season. I saw Jack and Locke's little religious fever as annoying. The death of Rodriguez & Watros's characters was the final straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode a 4/10 because it's the end of my show of this former big series created by Alias ​​Legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve on this one in the future.
