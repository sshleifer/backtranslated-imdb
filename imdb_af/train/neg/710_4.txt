I read Rice's novel with interest, and became relatively enchanted with his characters and heartbreaking story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I was simply APPALLED with this disastrous adjustment. The casting was simply based on physical appearance, not acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was not blond-haired, or was able to make his way out of a wet paper bag). The actors' embarrassment and careless efforts to influence a French accent were hilarious, but not entertaining. I shook myself through this darkened and melodramatic tik and was surprised that I made it to the end. <br /> <br /> A warning to novelists - stay away from this one.
