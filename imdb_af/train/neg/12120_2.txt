In what another twist of the mill could be, mediocre film on infidelity in the sixties (the subtle "liberal" period), the creators of this movie create a ridiculous scenario of ridiculous scenario and throw it all down small cherry at the top, happy ever after termination. At no time did I ever feel sympathetic to Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their difficult middle-class carefree life, nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The story line moves slowly to its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and viewable about this movie is the beautiful Diane Lane topless. Here's a tip, it happens about 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward to that part and skip the rest.
