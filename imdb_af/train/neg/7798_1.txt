This review is based on the abbreviated Shock-o-Rama video released on an unknown world in 2002. How bad is this? It's awful, which is a '1' on the IMDb scale - but it's much worse than that. It is nice to imagine that an original German-language picture can improve things - the comic English language copy is not funny at all - but it is truly one of the worst amateur movies of any genre you will probably see. The zombies in the movie are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don't seem to be able to talk or think about their next meal. However, they are also intelligent enough to use chain saws and maliciously enough to know that Western taboos about sex services will ease their table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead placed a zombie nation that retained a piece of social cohesion; here zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imagination of director Andreas Schnaas. Losing completely without social value, and even worse, completely lacking in entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone wasting money on it.
