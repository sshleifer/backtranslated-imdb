CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose to watch in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This film looked as if it was directed by a film student for his intro. after filmmaking class. His dad makes good movies. His sister made a good one. But brother Roman? NO! One critic had the audacity to compare this movie with Godard's Le MÃ©pris (contempt). While Coppola, Jr. Having taken the same idea, a film about film, he tried too hard to make himself look like he was European, artistic and witty, if it was just kitsch. The main actor carries the same expression throughout the film, as if he were in awe or shock of this film around him. Schwartzman somehow controls his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is good. The one scene that is actually a ghost humor is surprisingly not the B-movies, but rather one that takes place in Italy. Mounting shots of several different characters in a very small car, driving around to pick up and drop. It was the only thing that reminded me of the movie. I suspect he was trying to spoof. Or rip-off. Or both. The documentary starring in the camera and the filming of various objects was played out, the end was signed for the sake of a "twist" or artistic value ... I think the funniest thing about this movie was the movie itself, and not in the way it is meant. No wonder this movie was sent back after a fairytale screen was edited or shot again, or whatever, which made me just as distressed as it was. I can't believe it could have been worse than that. If you want to see a good parody of movie, check out the Austin Powers movies. Any of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of the cinema, please go back to direct your cousin's music videos. Leave the Godfathers to Dad.
