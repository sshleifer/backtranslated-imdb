While channel navigating, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. We were shocked at the apartment acting, and formulaic storyline. We have provided the explosive car screens, incredible shooting results, and put them down with the weight of tyro foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was to see all the recycled scenes of Dante's Peak, where the church front fell on the school bus, the shop fronts broke away from the main road, the overpass collapsed and the red truck accelerated the roadway like the bricks on it. fall. It was a good laugh, though it was unintentional, and the viewer wondered if it wasn't originally intended as a low budget gambling of disaster films.
