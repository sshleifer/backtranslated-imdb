Amateur, no budget movies can be surprisingly good ... however, it is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Oh, another Brad Sykes horror. The acting is terrible, except for Emmy Smith who shows a promise. The camera "direction" requires serious rework. And no longer "hold the camera and run too"; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unattractive, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you rip an ear, please do not let the actor's rights over the blood. The scenery is boring and boring (the same as Sykes' other businesses), and the music is a cross between cheap motocross and really bad guitar-driven metal (see screen commentary). <br /> <br /> Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently the author didn't. <br /> <br /> Whoever funds this man ... please stop. I saw some of his other "home movies" (which I won't pick) and they are just as bad. Usually a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur movie maker, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Certainly not even a popcorn film ... of course, cold on popcorn kernels will be less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a movie.
