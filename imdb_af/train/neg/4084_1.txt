You sometimes hear radio jokes that invite listeners to nominate movies that the listener cannot stand or never watched. This is the movie I think ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a play by Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think I put 20 seconds on this movie. I realized that my teens wouldn't cut themselves, and they looked at me to cut. <br /> <br /> This movie just seems boring and pretentious to me. <br /> <br /> Although this is the first movie I've given so low a score (which I actually tried to watch), I wouldn't want to postpone your other movies by his English director, Peter Greenaway. I remember being "The cook, the thief, his wife and her lover" was a wonderful British movie, although his content was sometimes belly, a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people will see it. <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Greenaway was "A zed and two noughts". Again, it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but it was intriguing. <br /> <br /> The other movie I usually think of for such radio show topics is "Brazil". It never managed to sleep the whole way. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a taste for self-explanatory movies that are highly stylized, laborious and difficult to follow, please send Prosero's Books clean.
