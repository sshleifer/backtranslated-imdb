It's one of the most annoying, nonsense movies I've ever had to go through. Every time it starts to look, it may be good, more sepia tone flashers, followed by paranoid idiot masking as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, will-rebels who apparently live in a house without any parents or responsibility. The supporting role-play is much more enjoyable and interesting, but is unfortunately never developed. We also never understand the John Stanton character that Maddox presumably influences to commit acts of rebellion. At one point I thought, "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and secretly makes all communication from escaped spiritual patient Stanton! Now we come somewhere!" but of course this is not the case and the whole movie seems to be meaningless, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer. Where's the Ferris Bueller when we need it?
