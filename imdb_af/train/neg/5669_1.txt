The director, equipped in chains and learning, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday night that we were going to see an "experienced" movie. Experimental? Leave the camcorder on the back seat of the car, let the tire roll and change into all the useless drinks inside it. A winding pastiche road show maneuver that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. The free violence that opened the movie drove more than one patron of the Castro theater. I would also have left, but my cine buddy needed a ride home and had this thing to see even the worse moths to the end. By the time the lights came up, the audience was considerably diluted. Tepid applause. Pro forma questions from the director who was satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
