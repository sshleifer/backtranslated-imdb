The Golden Age of Disney cartoons was dead by the end of the 90's. This show Quack Pack should not even be considered a DuckTales spin because the show had almost nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about a teenage boy Huey, Dewey and Louie because they are having trouble with their uncle Donald and talking in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed in contrast to DuckTales. I prefer the small adventurous cousins ​​of DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There are no references to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend it to you. If you want a better Disney show look "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
