If you like a syfi soap opera, this show is for you, as I'm worried, it doesn't work for me and after watching 3 episodes I can't see it anymore. It's boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is grounded about 100,000+ years ago if you're basing it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth, they all seem to have the same things as the 100,000-year-old Chevy off drive. The streets and people look at the 100,000-year-old popular name LCD TV sets. It's also the same with the rest of the sets also on show. There is just too much of today's thing about not thinking. I think they could have done much better to circumvent these issues and yes battlestar galactica had the same problems, but not so badly. Just as good as the rest of the show, it's not as good as SCR and it's a poor prior.
