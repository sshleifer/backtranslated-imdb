There is not one decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams is one of the worst shows of all time. Prove that you can start a look. The guy Sebastian struggles with, sucks as well. He doesn't even look like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are also terrible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is also crap. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (About the trio): If you can't beat them <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The end contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clear that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian Kathryn wanted so much, apart from being played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl he couldn't find and it killed him". She was a plague that wanted to play with him. The fact that she never gave it to him, she wanted to raise. Then it means in this P.O.S. that he can have her, along with a girl on the side. What? And we don't even see sex. This implies that it is not only stupid, useless and contradictory, but also worthless. <br /> <br /> And in the first one, Kathryn rejected Sebastian because he fell in love. Although he won the bet, it crumbled his chances. Then he loses in this outburst AND falls in love. So she doesn't screw "losers", just losers? Another thing: It's been said that Sebastian never fell in love, so what do you call the Virgin Girl thing? <br /> <br /> Finally, the virgin is suddenly revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover. (thin thin thin) and, as I said, they go into a parachute trio. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other plot contradictions. Did the author even see the first movie? A 5 year old can point out her well. <br /> <br /> After the trio, Sebastian damaged sex with the blonde virgin, her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned Evil Lesbian In Lame. Sudden sudden turn in front, listening and smiling in the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Since Sebastian became the hole he was in the first place, he could have made an interesting movie. I think everything that needs to be done was bad Sebastian, a threesome with two hot girls. Interesting.
