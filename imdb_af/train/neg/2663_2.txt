In an interview, David said Duchovny that he couldn't even watch the movie for the first time - and neither. The scene where he asked the owner of a house where a murder was committed, if he could look - changed the name he gave, and he could have lifted his performance from just about any episode of the X-Files. He's on autopilot for the whole movie. Brad Pitt is frightening.
