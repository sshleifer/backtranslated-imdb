I rented this movie on DVD. I knew the movie wouldn't live until it promised me, but as soon as I saw Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) in it, I had to rent it. It starts out pretty well, assuming sniffing movies are broadcast over cable. However, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her, and the end of the movie really makes you hang out. There are too many unanswered questions. In the end there was a big scene that totally surprised me, but overall it's a very subpar movie, but I think it was the $ 3.99 rental.
