Even when I watched this movie with a teenager, I just wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadora played in a movie about an artist who had slept her way to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs. Zadora is, even she can't keep this sorry-ass apology from a movie of tank. Not even her photos for Penthouse, in which "The Lonely Lady" is promoted is "back in the day," this movie can hold. The only thing that saved this movie? A completely different writing. Give this one a miss.
