I rarely saw such a gratuitous waste of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of a movie. What a few interesting strings the film seems to promise is initially little more than red herring. Humanities - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - deployed in roles that go nowhere; An occasional genius director produces a film that looks like it is being filmed by a coffee-stained camera lens; A writer (John Grisham) who has never earned anything, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but hardly at the level of comment - it's really part of the aesthetic. Usually I come to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This incredible disaster of a movie just makes me an endless, evil rant. I will not, but just because I no longer want to occupy my "thought" with this trash.
