This movie was exactly what I expected to be when I read the casting. I probably wrote a more exciting plot, it's a pity they left it for a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba certainly was a good skier, but he must thank God (and us) for not relying on his acting skills to earn his living. He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very well on the continent without his skis. Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and that's all. Of course, she was not chosen for her amazing ability in dramatic roles, but most likely for her beautiful legs. Nevertheless, I have to admit that she can be the Tomba's acting teacher, because he's even a worse actor than her, and it's funny, especially since she's not Italian. I laughed all the time watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it made me laugh very hard.
