A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and in Frosty the Snowman's evil twins are mutated. Then a deadly spree goes on. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it's scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise it is a kind of cheese. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie that can become a cult movie. I'm sure there is somewhere a loyal fan base. I'm just not in it. Although I didn't have the movie as a whole, there were a few scenes I found amusing. Like the scene of the scene and the post-explosion scene with the Picasso reference. It was also nice to see the many ways the heroes are trying to kill Jack, and he just doesn't want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B film, but a bad, low budget B movie.
