Images are wonderful and reflect the Canada landscapes well. The story, on the other hand, was rather boring; For my eyes it was a love story in the bush, just like Titanic was a love story on a boat. I didn't feel that Gray Owl was a great environment. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this one was ... bad.
