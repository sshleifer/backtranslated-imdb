This movie's basic premise is a political cartoon. I guess for those who know nothing of the realities of the army, it's probably a "feel good" film about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator said: "It makes women know they can do everything they want to do." What a bang! No one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately, Demi Moore makes a few sessions at the local gym in the early 27-week BUD / S program. SEAL simply won't do that. There is about 80% decrease in what is probably the most difficult military training program - that is, those who voluntarily fall out, cannot compete physically, often suffer from bodily injury during training or cannot handle psychological treatment. I never got past the eagerness of the confronted, alleged message of this movie. In the real world, Demi will not hold the first 24 hours of this hard and sustained physical training. Wishing alone will not. Skip this movie as a wishful thought and spend your time reading the magazine "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what really goes on in this training. Call the call, Demi! <br /> <br />
