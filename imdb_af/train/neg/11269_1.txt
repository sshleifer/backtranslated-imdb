Must confess that I have seen some dimples in my time, but this one is there with the worst of them. Plot appalling to follow. Sex and violence are ungratefully derived and derived from the very poorly composed film. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the casting will look back on the end product and it will have to collect dust on a shelf, not to be disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately I did the DVD in my case. It will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
