This movie is just like any other Dutch movie, so if you enjoy movies like turmeric and the little blonde dead. then it may be good with this one (although the two have much better stories and actors). Summer heat is getting strong enough, but even one good scene does not end up with the storyline. There is a lot of nudity (but I and others just can't find that girl attractive), the dialogue is laughing (as we did a lot for the annoyance of other movie-goers), and some of the screens are so random that it's more an unintentional comedy as anything else (like a random scene in which an owl smashes someone's eye ... it has nothing to do with anything and is referred only once in a sentence and said: did you hear what happened ... I was there.) The only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places where they are look pretty ... that's it, and why I saw it, was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews, you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is you will be All What You know, it's a new movie that's not yet in the theaters, my advice is to get away from this tranquility If you really want to see a good Dutch cinematic or black book.
