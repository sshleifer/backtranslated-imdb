Okay, I rented this movie because of the director. He has made interesting movies in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork, you miss a fun ride). Anyway, from the start I had my doubts about this movie, but I decided to suck it up and watch it. It's bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie, and don't spoil, read ahead. First, the old saying, "You can't judge a book by its cover" here. The box for this movie shows that Jill is the tall fox with tall hair. The back of the box has a cool shot of the red leather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. You start to look at it and suddenly you find out that the film took place in 1977 (inexplicably). Jill is a total dog that is not the girl on the cover. The movie isn't quite as predictable as you'd think ... and that's not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without any motive of motivation ... it is embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have no good reason. What was the point of murdering Dolph the other woman in cold blood who helped him. Anthony Hickox, the director, had seen a stinker when he read the script. If it was set in the underworld of the new millennium and the characters made halfway intelligently, it could be decent. To put it in the 70's, makes no sense and has no influence on the story whatsoever. Avoid it!
