This succession is a total rehash of the first movie. A completely senseless movie. It basically just took every sceanrio of the first movie and they did it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time. It even ends in the same way as the first one! The music is too busy and interfering, and as it is almost a copy of Omen I, it is extremely predictable. It's not a terrible movie, it's not horrible, there's a lot of worse movies out there, it has absolutely no point in making it. The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more senseless than that, so I think so. If you show someone a rifle on your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reams, I think I'll choose it.
