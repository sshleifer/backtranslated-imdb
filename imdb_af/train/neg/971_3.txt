After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought I'd give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the movie, I thought I'd give it my own review. This is my first ever naked with me. <br /> <br /> First, I would scratch the horror of the genre, because it is by no means terrible or scary in the slightest (with the exception of some poor attempts to make yourself hopefully one of the things that worked on me.) I would say that calling this movie, a thriller, is pushing it, because I was not too excited! The film is about a spoiled, naughty girl who disappears several times. During these times she visits a house that signs her. After each visit, she decided to add something else at home to make it a little more lively. One of the features is a sad little boy who is also sick. As she welcomed the boy, she realized that her imaginary world she created was actually better than the real world she was in. Until she constantly fathered her away at home, due to a misdrawing, her father seemed angry and her and the boy had to escape from his clutches. <br /> <br /> Think this is an attempt to be a slightly more soft version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but is more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> Finally, my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you watching this fool!
