As far as movies are concerned, it's just enough. Entertainment characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I would have liked a lot if I wasn't very irritated while looking at the extreme disrespect, it shows the city in which it is set. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet every character is English (except Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accent is only briefly heard in many circles and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes her "real life", it's a little more like real life). I really don't think it would be hurt to use one of the many talented Scottish actors ... or at least have English children who can throw a decent accent! The useless attempt to use the word "woe" a few times has nothing but to promote the insult.
