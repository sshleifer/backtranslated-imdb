Dark comic serendipity about a cosmetic product sales, with strange links with Elvis Presley, who runs into a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while talking to conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally murdered each of them through few errors. Kim Basinger, an attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to play impressive movies to play in, but this horrible script (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) doesn't have a good sense of humor. The stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the things of classic comedy, but even on a shocking, shameful level, the picture is rough and messy. If you look, see if you can count how many shots there are from Basinger behind the wheel of her pink Cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-pleated look on her face. Hopefully she and Elvis are well paid. NO stars from ****
