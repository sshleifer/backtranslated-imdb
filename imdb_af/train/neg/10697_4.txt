First, I thought it was bad for them to say in the credits that the story and script were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood writers until his talent disappeared and he retired. However, this was not the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was based mainly on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes in possession of an evil object that will grant him, but eventually will punish him for hell. It is good. Nobody said authors should be original. The actors are generally properly qualified given the mediocre writing they had to translate on the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem a little differently in an attempt to save an innocent person. Initially, it looks like it really was with the code of the modern horror movie, but they feel they have to give up the last horror movie at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. The older horror movies just played well, so the hero could finally win. There is nothing wrong with good victory over the evil, no matter what the current crop of filmmakers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy fright and still make them happy at the end. In fact, I think it's better.
