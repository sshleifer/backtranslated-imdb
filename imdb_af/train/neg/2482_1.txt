(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely horrible movie. First of all, it has the man of medium. I think he has made a career of playing super doting fathers. It was OK the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending he was a monster ... but then they did it again 10 minutes later! And so it goes, this movie moves in ominous real time. At one point, I started imaging it was days later, until I was reminded that the story line was only the next day ... early in the afternoon! I'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life. First, they are presented as a kind of a Jupiter from Manhattan who grew up and had a child. But they are driving an old blue Volvo. These types of years have no longer managed Volvo. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002 I'm sure they haven't run Volvo's yet. <br /> <br /> Then there is Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a little magical Wendigo image and tells him of his powerful magic. Let's ... we still do ancient Indian secrets. Just driving home, they cross every Indian statue in their New York tourist approach. American Indians are portrayed in a way that has not been seen in this movie for decades! Oh, and about Wendigo. He is not really the cause of the abomination. He doesn't kill the child's father, it's the most horrible thing in the movie. He was just killed by a normal grudge and a high gun. The Wendigo only comes late in the film to avenge the man who killed the father ... oh, but wait, it was earlier that Wendigo was so fond of the father, maybe because he killed a branch. So then Wendigo had to be happy that the father was killed ... but ... <br /> And so it goes ... offensive, boring and stupid. There is no reason to watch this movie.
