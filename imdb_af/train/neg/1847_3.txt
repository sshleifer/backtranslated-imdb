SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens if you get a lot of unhealthy people together to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of acting, production, storyline, FX, etc ... goes out of the window in an attempt to create shock value. Don't get me wrong. I consider myself a fine professor of shock films, and the sleazier / gorier / nastier is better - but it's quite nice to see some talent from someone involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicle the life of Harry Russo - a drug addict freak show commanding to kill his ventriloquist's dummy, Rubberneck. He talks about a few freaks that kill hookers and other random people and screams about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (it's "whores" for those of you who don't speak New York ...) and how he want to rape in the ass. There are some bad neck patches, very gore, and a little nudity to mix things a little - but nothing you haven't seen in a better movie. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing I can find in this delayed movie is the often (inadvertently?) hilarious screaming program of our chief, Harry. He continues and goes over to kill everyone and make them in the ass, and it actually gets rather comical. In fact, I am almost tempted to believe that there should be some kind of gay erotic undertone to this movie, with all the ass talk and continuous shots of Harry walking around with his dong hangin out. In fact, the joker is no longer nestling in this movie, then the few chicks that show a few T-and-A (and some frontals, for a good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is almost amusing as a one-time watch, but I can really only recommend it to those who want to say they watched a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far, is the best thing about this trash ... A generous 3.5 / 10
