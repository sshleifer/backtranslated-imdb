I read the novel Reaper by Ben Mezrich a few years ago and last night I accidentally saw this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although it has been years since I first read the story, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous. Very important elements that probably made the whole thing were just written or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot looks interesting to you: go the novel. She much, much, much better. Still 4 out of 10, as it was difficult to stop watching because of the great basic plot of Ben Mezrich.
