The best thing about camp movies in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling game or a daytime soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the slam plot, identify the cardboard characters and observe while all the clicks are being fulfilled. But sometimes the director does something really unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid, or something strange, or something informative. The director Makinen is there with the best camp directors, and it's his best movie. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, everything looks all together. There is nothing good about it, but it still manages a coherent whole. Not once does the movie slow down - the action goes up and bumps continue. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no timeline: some characters seem to be doing months while other characters only spend one hour at a bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so you do not experience the day at night. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a plot, there, somewhere. Maybe you should watch the movie three times before you realize it.
