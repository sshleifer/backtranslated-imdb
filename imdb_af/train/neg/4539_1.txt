I didn't see anything as horrible as this movie. The movie was boring, long and awful. The special effects suck like hell - It's like a movie back in 1999. It's a total waste of half an hour of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was rather bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs. He wasn't that bad. In fact, not bad. But in this movie his play was not convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was also no chemistry between the rest of the crew. Plus, his eyes looked empty as if he didn't feel it. It really surprised me because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, don't even bother to watch this movie. It's a big big waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, something else to do if you watch this movie. Trust me, you will regret it!
