A few months ago I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. The poster insisted that if I had a chance to flush away, I'd like it. Based on the argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (at least on Aardman's part) but doesn't have the power to pull it all together. His best asset is sewer / boat captain, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, had to be the main character of the movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, hard and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his screen time. <br /> <br /> One of the most bothering me about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to start. with. When Roddy touches the screen, the movie makes sure he is hit five again. "My name is Shocky," said one of Rita's brothers, who electrocuted Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that involves pain is low all the time. <br /> <br /> I won't waste time on Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies towards Pixar (One similar movie happens to be, five is a rip off), but I'll say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do so much better (and do). Try harder next time, guys.
