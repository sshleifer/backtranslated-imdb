After Harry Reems' teenage friend is raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems becomes discouraged and consolidates himself by having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who wears a sugar cane and dresses like a wizard, rapes even more women. Eventually Reems decides to find him and end his crime spree. Despite being shot on film and slightly nasty, it looks like any other 70's porn and is improperly executed. The rape / abusive tones are surprisingly limited and the attempt to enter "Death Wish" is ridiculous. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") plays a policeman. Colt, which is usually over-the-top, wigs out in a few scenes, but he's worn too well for my money. This roughness could have been much harder.
