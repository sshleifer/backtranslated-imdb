What is the point of creating prosecutions that have absolutely no relevance to the original film? No point. That's why the Prom Night successors are so embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> The original movie included a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually killed everyone, one in a cruel act of revenge. Can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen should rise from the grave to the steel that has the crown with the first movie? Prom Night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience to constantly wonder how it happened and why should it happen? But in the end, I think you can call it one of those movies that is so bad, you end up getting through it.
