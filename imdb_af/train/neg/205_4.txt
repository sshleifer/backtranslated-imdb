I jumped to see the movie rude and uninterrupted, remember rahs and raves for that. But where it turned out, it was frightening, and it went off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, the wrong turn in raw sewage, were dropped before they shouted. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost expressionless mask of face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found to be mirroring while the film was worn. What could be in the background was a cacophony that was apparently designed to hit terror in the head. The ideas that modern-day elders can embody that indigenous peoples believe red-colored white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are more like a shopping list as a hint in another dimension. br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? Approximately? How big? A tsunami? Yes, okay. It is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? It will be a great big wave. Why? Was the world a place bad? It doesn't look so terrible in this movie. Actually, I didn't think the wave came down, as the shadow Burton's face thrown by the wave left. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Heck, it happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't important if it were just him. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying scene and one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential was in Charlie's apartment where Burton faced the parent's husband for Burton's wife. Charlie still asks him: "Who are you?" and it gets really upsetting after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed.
