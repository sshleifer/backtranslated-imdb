The often reliable Leonard Maltin says it's a "beautiful romance" and that Sanders is "wonderful". Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders are slim and droll and beautiful, as usual, ?? You can reflect your appearance of the line about adultery: "Sometimes the parents' chains are so heavy that they must be worn by three." But dull, wood and dated, this film describes more accurately. The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a pure jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who heads the police but can barely resist to resist the lure of fine jewelry, is enough to entertain, but It has the same kind of hollow historic Hollywood treatment that hit. such magazines as * Marie Antoinette *, and definitely the regrettable * Forever Amber * (screaming for a classic remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders is trying to add depth to his character, that's all for nothing. I am an impudent Douglas Sirk fan, but it was 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest US efforts, which lacks much of the signature servants, who will define its flowers, breast shark pot boilers. Sirk just made his feet wet and made a number of unbeatable movies over the next ten years until he hit gold with * Beautiful Obsession * and hit his battle and bombarded us with such estrogen festivals as * everything that allows heaven *, * Written on the wind *, and * imitation of life *. But * Scandal In Paris * is hardly his best job ?? a relatively low budget ratio with cheesy sets and inefficient costumes.
