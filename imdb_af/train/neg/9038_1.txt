This is a terrible production of Bartleby, though not, as the other reviewer put it because it is "unfilterable", but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so. When I see this, I can turn around the pages in my book and follow it, which is not so much fun when an adjustment is made. Rather look at the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. This version, while humorous, brings new details to the movie while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What matters is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like institution, character names and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, boring and hilarious. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if an adjustment is treated poor, painful, ingenious shock.
