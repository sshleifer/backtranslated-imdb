Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time on this milestone of cinematic incompetence. Life is simply too short. What I will say is that Alone In The Dark only succeeds in three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots into the air, but to drop them all. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. It is totally embarrassing the classic PC game that it is supposedly based on a complete failure in all aspects of making movies . <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if that is what you are (I think proctology here), what on earth are you doing in a director's seat?
