Although the plot was very detailed and the story line was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals's voice was dubbed with another by most of the movie was alarming because you weren't sure who was talking. There were many parts where he would start speaking in his deeply grumpy voice and then the next one of the other's voice did the talking for him. I do not know the reason, but if he had problems with his voice during the production of the movie, I think they could have repaired the events that did not have his own voice when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 of 10 based on the quality of the movie. When you pay for a movie whether it's at the theater or on DVD, this movie is not worth the admission fee. I was a longtime follower of Steven Seagal and all his films he has been doing over the years. To date, I think this is one of the worst things we've ever seen.
