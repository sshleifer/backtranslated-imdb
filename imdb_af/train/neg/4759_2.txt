In the name of Pinter, every knee will bend - especially after his Nobel Prize for Literature Acceptance speech, which just over the intricate, numbered, sixth-shaped anti-Americanism.

The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical cookie, and it is easy to see how the central plot device works better on stage than the screen, but it still worked very well. It's a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's see, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he can't even fill his bathroom slippers.

He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but this is a pity! Give it a very wide cabin and stick to the excellent original. It's more of a half pin.
