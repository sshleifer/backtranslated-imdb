Alan Rudolph has four years after his director's debut with the art house snoozer "Welcome To L.A." show what he really wanted from Hollywood was one of the guys. "Roadie" is a frat-boy fracas packed with barroom brawl, horny harp, Art Carney in a sophisticated wheelchair ... and meat loaf on the wheel. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a very beautiful face on the screen, and perhaps in a smaller role (in a better movie), he can indeed be intrigued, but Zalman King's writing is full stereotypical redneck humor and helpless meat bread are kept widely and moronically. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie all make appearances - and everyone looks shy. They should definitely, "Roadie" is a bad trip. NO stars from ****
