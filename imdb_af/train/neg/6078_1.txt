I seldom comment on movies, but I read the other comments and I can't believe there are people who applaud this cellulosic rubbish. I know there are some people who have their own agenda, but we can take it on earnings. acted badly, shot badly and the story felt like the director made it up while he was going. I'm not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the movie with small children, as the makers of the film knew of course what they wanted and what their audience wanted. All I can say is it's a horrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateurish and I'm glad they couldn't make a legal film today.
