This time we get a psycho-toy maker named "Joe Petto" (what?) Which makes living, evil toys that kill people. He goes to the family who has the accident to just live in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "Pino" (again, that?) Just went. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and hopefully [probably] the last) in this semi-series, this one and the former look like soft core porn movies, but without the sex and nudity. It's kind of like a low-rent "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad house movies. Presumably they started doing a sixth chapter in the series in 2000, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can only hope that it stays that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star **** <br /> <br />
