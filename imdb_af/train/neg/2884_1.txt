While working at a video store, I regarded it as my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers. In the midst of one day of particularly heated debate on what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to B.T.K. Killer, even if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice, was the worst movie ever, then he watched it. I lost. I believe that even I made better videos than that at high school, and it was hardly big feats of a young genius. This movie was not only about the production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad video camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wood, hollow and pathetic not scratching the surface) as well as just generally felt bad movie. I can recall a scene where I hear a glass smash, suddenly I am reminded of a few bad high school games (I know I'm here too often here, but this movie looks very young), both in terms of the set what was too fake, but also as if people were reading their lines of writing, not quite sure what was actually going on. My review does not do this film justice, because I cannot describe how totally awful the time I spent spending it was. It is almost ironic that I do a pathetic work describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
