The Japanese sense of pacing, editing and musical score must be different from the American taste, but this movie may surely have been so much more with a little more post-production work. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood needs to re-create this movie and I think it will be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There is something about the edges of the city, eager policemen, earthquakes, sanatoriums and mysterious saltwater murders that are enough to be fascinating. However, this story should only make a little sense and can be shorter about 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the "sixth sentence" effect was in full force in this movie, and it was clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As it stands, only the hard-hit Japanese movie lovers should see the o-so-boring movie.
