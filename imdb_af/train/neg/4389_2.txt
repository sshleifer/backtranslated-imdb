If you want occasional nudity with junior high school folding comedy, look no further. <br /> <br /> Starting at about halfway, start the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle with every occasion. This is the only thing that made this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> The story is lame and ominous, humor is stingy and character development is basically non-existent.
