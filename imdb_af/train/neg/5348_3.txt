Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is donating his problematic shrinking / expanding machine to the Smithsonian Institution, as he and his wife, Diane (Eve Gordon) are ready for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall) . Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children, Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson), volunteer to look at Adam while his parents are away. title will let you expect), the adults are accidentally cut by Wayne's shrinking jet. As the kids run amok, they have to fight miniaturized people with great insects, wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons, and other threats. It was bad, as most straight after the video follow-up, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was kind of laughing. I had to laugh at the movie "Roach" Stuart Pankin and the party bulls were even more ridiculous, seeing at their own risk!
