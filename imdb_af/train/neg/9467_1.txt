If you like the Grinch movie, watch it again, because it wasn't so close to a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers's Cat is probably the most annoying character to have "screened" the screen lately. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a terribly sounding sound, which is the only thing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids like this one, and kids are laughing now. Save your money and go look Looney Tunes: Back in action if you are really looking for a fun holiday family movie.
