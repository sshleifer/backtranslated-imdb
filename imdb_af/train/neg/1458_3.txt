The back cover of the DVD (which missed this one when it came out) comes from Hitler - the resurrection of evil as "a triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Never give up on the Post, but really, who ever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of, ahem, art, must be dismissed. <br /> <br /> I'm not true to start with. Why try to paint the picture of Hitler's evil with colors that didn't exist? He was wrong, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the soft and muted way he treated women) and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, so feel sorry for them because they are being held in their one-dimensional characters. Here's a kind of curse with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he finally plays an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or in this case TV production, accurately). Of course, the first one was the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This one is OK if it is on the telly and you have nothing else to do but believe me - this is the best on the shelf in your local Virgin Store.
