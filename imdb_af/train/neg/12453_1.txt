I've always been a great Lynda Carter Wonder Woman fan, so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie by name. She does not wear the right costume [she had refused or ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's James Bond. There is nothing of the things that the gift heroine has made a success, that is, the superhuman strength or determined will. This is just a long bad dream. I don't even think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I won't waste your time on it.
