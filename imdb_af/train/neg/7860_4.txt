Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg", will take the heat, with Wes Craven, for another shabby "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The remembrance of the legendary original, boasting an incredible storyline and a dog with a flashback, will be wiped out forever by these technically polished remakes (by name only). A lot of national guards (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one, the weekend soldiers are being collected. That's it. There are some hardcore violence and a fairly cruel rape scene, but there is a bit of a difference to get excited about. The movie's "heroes" are the usual bunches of cliches and the mutants, far from Craven's original "family", mostly look to Brian Thompson of "Cobra" along with some creatures left by Stan Winston of the Wrong Turn shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves, called "The Descent", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughing aspect is West and Jonathan Craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant that walks around in his original "Chainsaw" around his cave like Leatherface. Weisz will be guilty of this dim debacle, but he is not really guilty because he does his best to maintain tension and express freshness from the confronted situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.
