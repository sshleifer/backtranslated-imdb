The film is picked up over the past year with the military founder of the electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the first film attacks took place. The crew is not killed long before a group of soldiers find a practice exercise. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> It is a payment card all around. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, or in anyone behind the camera. It's a movie made for the money and nothing else. At some level, it had to work, it could have been a more horrible Southern Comfort (where some national runners run in the swamps), but it's not much of anything. To a large extent, you can blame the writing, which was incredibly partially written by Wes Craven, who hit the same old targets time and again. Add to the mess the fact that the direction is vague and the set up ranges are so lacking in gloss than removing any inherent tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> It's not bad, but bad and boring. Let me put my feelings into context: The reason I watched this movie was because a local multiplex screwed and ran this movie instead of the kids, the Last Mimzy flashing and I wanted to see what caused the exclamation (I thinks the films have that much in common - he says sarcastically). I am convinced that this movie will only scare those who love the last Mimzy.
