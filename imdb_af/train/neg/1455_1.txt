I'm rarely exposed to such an absolute nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure. A horrible joke of a movie, I hung all day. Terrible, foolish, distorted and beaten with straight lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was originally a consultant for this movie. However, he found the writing so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded that they cease to use his name as a source (it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved.) <br /> <br /> One scene shows that Hitler is hitting his dog. There is not one source for this. Hitler loved animals above humans. He introduced the most stringent welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal testing. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film turns its thrill of the Iron Cross into a farce involving bribery. Excellent lies. He has awarded it for repeated, long-term, courageous acts. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents suggesting that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his cousin. Not one. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this rubbish flip. <br /> <br /> If he was even half as ignorant, demented and fat as he is This nonsense movie as in real life, you wouldn't even know he ever existed. Never mind being the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> Watch Downfall and give it a very wide cabin.
