Being a big fan of the "other" PLANET OF THE APES movies, I rented this DVD despite my dislike of Tim Burton. Once again, he does not fail with his uninspired direction. Even the monkey makeup looks second-rate, which is unforgivable given the mondeous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg once and for all proves that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not proven). I was embarrassed by real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt, their payment contracts motivated them, as it could not be the click-through script. I rented this DVD on a special $ 1 night and I still feel ripped off.
