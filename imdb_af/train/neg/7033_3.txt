Black Candles is rather a confused mess of the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others. I only see the one I saw. Anyway, we made some love and then stood somewhere near a pen over a voodoo doll and then pierced it and threw the man over. Not sure if it was good for one of them, at that time. Fast forward to where the man's sister came home to investigate and hear the will of the will, or something that serves, and of course everyone except her is devil worshiping. It's really hard to tell who is at the moment in the movie and it sometimes gets confusing. To focus on things, there is a simulated bestiality scene (I hope it is simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd. Ugh. Sometimes it speaks of "Rosemary's Baby", minus the baby, because the hostess always gives one woman herbal tea and the place series of whatever nasty satanic herbs it is, for it stays clear. However, the herbs are not the only thing that falls over this film. The end seems to be back, and many viewers may be wondering where they were in the middle. It's not incompatible, it's just not very good, and I think it all depends on what you'd like to see in movies, and there wasn't much here for me. 3 out of 10.
