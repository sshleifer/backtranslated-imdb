A comparison between this movie and "The Last Detail" is made by some, but "Chasers" are flatter than a piece of the interstate highway in West Texas. And like the beauty of the desert, there is nothing to distinguish it, and not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two naval shooters this time around. No one in the throw is too good; With this lame script it is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, doesn't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memorandum, I don't think.
