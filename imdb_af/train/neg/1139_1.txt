Please note that I did not see the movie because I discovered it in 2007 and my town is smaller and does not carry it. But I really want to say something about it. I actually do research for the university at the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person on whom they were the main character was actually completely different !!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license granted, the real dr. Bucke fully endorsed the hypstectomy to cure insanity in women, and would never represent anything as liberal as in the film. I think it is nice to see several film critics writing for legitimate newspapers who say this film has a historical base! The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time on a film with such negligence the horror experienced by real women in the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry.
