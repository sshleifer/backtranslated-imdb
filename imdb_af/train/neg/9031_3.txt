Payback is the game played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the later fireworks. Why would a man get involved with the trophy woman of a relentless mob boss in the gangster's own house with suspicious henchmen everywhere? Why would an unhappy woman encourage the attention of a full stranger and expect him to carry her with him and leave her husband and boredom to ever stay happy with her new love? Certainly, the hero, here Kevin Costner, has expected a reaction from the face-faced man, giving the movie an excuse to enjoy senseless gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, a good actor he was, surely earned better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure that suffers from what she likes to charm her prince. Stoves are good, but her Spanish accent does not work. The cameos of the smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.
