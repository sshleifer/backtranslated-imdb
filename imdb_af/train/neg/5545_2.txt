"Revolt of the Zombies" proves that the fact that the same director has reloaded and recovered an idea does not necessarily make lightning strike. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, who are responsible for the horror classic "White Zombie", made it. a few pieces of garbage, just a few years later, to collect his popularity and even recover the close eyes of Lugosi's eyes from the previous film. There was a court battle with the "White Zombie" movie's rights owners, who didn't want Halperins to use the word "zombie" in this title. The word was the only thing that could help this movie, because as everyone knows, bad movies can make much more money simply by seeing the word "Zombie" in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of doing a few years before, makes this uninteresting movie more insulting. It seems he never sent a horror movie to this debacle again. The zombies here do not seem to die, but only hypnotism victims. <br /> <br /> Want to create a mind-controlled army of zombies? Be ready to crack some eggs, including your own. <br /> <br /> THE LAME PLOT: Man falls in love with twilight woman playing with his heart and just getting engaged to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous. It sends the man in a spiral of madness in which he tries to use the use of zombie mind control techniques to change his benefits in an attempt to win a woman who is not worth it. <br /> <br /> It includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments I've ever seen. You must be blind or stupid not to see the end come. The acting isn't even good. This film makes the racially-sensitive "King of the Zombies" (which appears on the same double-funny DVD) looks like an atmospheric horror masterpiece in comparison and reminds us that not every black and white movie is a classic. This makes the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese party "invisible invaders" look like a serious drama. This is a large ball of cheese, so ridiculous melodramatic. It can probably make a Korean movie story very much (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits call the ironically named company favorite movies. I'm not sure whose favorite movie it would be, but of course it's an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance or classic movies.
