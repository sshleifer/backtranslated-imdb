Description: Corny, totally stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people wasted even 2 months or so to spend a budget (I guess ...) probably not more than 700 dollars to make this movie . It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save your time, life and money, by NOT - I repeat, don't even consider seeing this movie. This movie is so meager, it will make your face purple of indignant boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, you need to be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You may admire it. (As I said before, if you have a one-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 actors of your own, a few dolls you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, you will make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap.
