"The triumph of love" does not conquer anything. It's a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually, it's a little less than 2 hours, it just looks much longer. It hurts me to even think of the amateurish performances of such good actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players aren't quite as terrible. Maybe they were trying to be over the top, to be clownish, but if so, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesn't make any impression. She's just there. My guess is, the game of the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. It can't be worse. Clare Peploe, author and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I don't know what she thinks when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe it has lost everything in the translation.
