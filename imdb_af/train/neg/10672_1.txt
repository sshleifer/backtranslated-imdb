It had all the clich√©s of movies of this kind and no dust. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker to watch it. The production was good; However, the screenplay and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed with crumby actors. The good actors did not keep their own and did not lift the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is no longer worthy but I will say more to meet the minimum ten rule requirement. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for sensible entertainment, I'd still not recommend this movie.
