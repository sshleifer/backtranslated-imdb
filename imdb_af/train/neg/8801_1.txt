Composed of dead body parts (scraped scenes) of corpses (Anchorman), the Frankenstein Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes (something you'll ever see twice .... But once more. <br /> <br /> More often than not the relativity of the scenes in WURB is made relevant by a third person narrator. Even more disturbing is that the characters in WURB are not inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman. In the revelation story, it is said that WURB takes place shortly after the original. At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy has grown since the beginning of the film and embraced having a hybrid anchor woman / lover. In this film he is back to his immature antiquity with prank calls to Veronica. Obviously, this is more of the same scenes of the original Anchorman split into WURB. <br /> <br /> The part that makes it a movie, a constantly evolving story, involves a bank-moving clan without a reason called the alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to go through. This part has been deleted from the original scripts for Anchorman. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes involved in our Channel 4 news team are obviously alternative / retracted screens by Anchorman. They go to the same party as in the original, same original "group of women on the team", and the same cats fashion show segment that Veronica has objection to report. <br /> <br /> Burgundy Restore their first date with the entry point that San Diego looks out for and dinner at his favorite club, Tinos. No character indicates that they were at the entry point before entering Burgundy with Veronica in Tinos, but he suggested it to them as if they had never been before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as on their original date. <br /> <br /> However, I have to give credit to the filmmakers - even though WURB is nothing but a smart way to offer scanned scenes. tied together with narration. Between the two Ron Bourgogne stories - this is the weaker one. Looking back, it is quite an achievement for Anchorman to rise from the axis of WURB. You stay attractive, IMDb. Thank you for stopping.
