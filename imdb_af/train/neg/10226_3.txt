"Don't bother watching this movie," would be better advice if you keep Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. It was a great disappointment in view of the big role, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just nothing, certainly nothing like the VHS box. There was simply no tension, precious little excitement and too many dull spots. Most are trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messed up. It wasn't a good role for Monroe, although I didn't need this character to know she could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was good evidence for me. But this role did not suit her and it is no surprise. It wasn't one of her more popular movies. <br /> <br /> It's also too bad that a movie wastes the talents of actors such as Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisa Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.
