A romantic and thorough false vision of unemployment from a middle class "artist" with a comfortable education. Obviously, the author director never suffered unemployment and certainly has no personal experience. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages act like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live through the day by wearing pranks, boys jokes. They never seek work, they almost never do rejection or anxiety, etc. Life on the dole just goes like a summer holiday from school ... cowardly. Specifically if you compare it to contemporary masterpieces by Ken Loach, etc.
