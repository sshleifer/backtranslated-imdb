This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I cannot allow in good conscience this movie to be reviewed by me. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis, and Christopher Walken, and yet I have this movie hated. There is a plot, but it does matter if there is no writing. The dialogue is unreal and boring, the situations are at hand, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary. The characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting, and the story, though based on a good point of departure, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo. <br /> <br /> Remember to waste MONEY on this movie, it is not even worth spending your time watching it. Please don't see it ... I beg you!
