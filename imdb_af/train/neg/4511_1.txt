Rather than having long dance sequences and close ups of the characters dragged into the movie - the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivation of the characters. <br /> <br /> The marginalization of Nubo, the minister, aunt, mother - and the dumbing of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri, had no real depth to the film. If you didn't read the book, you wouldn't really understand why Sayuri loved the president and why Mameha became her mentor. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie was wonderful - and the actors did everything best with the C rate script they were given, but all that was good about this movie.
