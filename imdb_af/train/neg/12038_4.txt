Going somewhere in this movie. There are just the bizarre short scenes I didn't know about hell, so don't count it. This movie is so boring it hurts, and it comes from a person who likes movies when making movies. Confused, well, I was looking at this. What was Donald Sutherland because he completely missed it. And what's with the "pedophile" scene at the start of the movie. Can someone sleep? 10/04
