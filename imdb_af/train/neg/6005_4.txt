This is a classic stinker with a big name, mostly seniors who were well over with their first and bedtime in this one. <br /> <br /> Thinking about it is quite a depressing movie. Stay on earth, and you will face disease and eventually your downfall. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed that she can still dance. The film didn't focus anymore. Lookout, Maureen Stapleton has still shown the steps of "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom", much more than 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie doesn't encourage seniors. to commit suicide at Jim Jones level. How can someone be so idiotic enough to say it and say it's thinking? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the seniors did such a wonderful thing at the end, why was the young man encouraged to get off the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg also jump ship? After all, he found his lady love. <br /> <br /> It would have been a nice movie if seniors could find their youth fountain on earth and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and Lord know who is completely gone. The authors had to have taken the script and also posted it to this group.
