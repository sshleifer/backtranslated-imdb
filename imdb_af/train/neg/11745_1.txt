The fact that I don't like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical inaccuracies are not. I realize it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if others are falsely commenting on it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation, staged. and reorganize due to the discovery on board the ship, to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons. One was Samir Kuntar, a fiery terrorist whose story you can find by looking for 'klinghoffer samir kanar' on google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist activities, even though he never sat on the Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never hit the airplanes that hit the WTC? <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoils *** <br /> <br /> The film excuses the terrorists' actions and reactions almost because of the horrors they could have lived, they always emphasized and exaggerated the Israelis did to hurt them. However, they never show the pain the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis. The film uses (pretty awful !!!) images of the Sabra and Chatila horror, and nothing is said, and endorses the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible without ever mentioning it to be a Syrian -Libian army was what <br /> <br /> The acting was generally very bad, but I think that's what opera singers can expect. <br /> <br /> On another note, I'm shocked at how to excuse terrorists. killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, adding that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how insatiably his wife was, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope nobody in the world is as cruel as she is (wink)
