you have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55 years old at filming, but watched about 70 years and he only lived 8 years. At one point Holden said, "I'm more than twice your age." Okay, try three grandpa! The theme you previously shot didn't work. Dedicated senior citizens sometimes come up with legal teenagers. More power for them, but that doesn't mean I want to see it. It's not a matter of judgment, but the digestive tract. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is nice to watch, and the 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc. Make it worth it if it comes to the cable late at night and you want to look at something to hit bed. It would have been nice to see Lenz's blonde friend, the one who raced her guitar, got more scenes. Pleasantly spacious ... Who was this chick? I'm going to try to find out.
