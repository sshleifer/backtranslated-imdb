This discount from the 1984 hit "Gremlins" is perhaps the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made. Even for a 'B' movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform disappear this movie in terms of plot, acting and goodness. <br /> <br /> It starts with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is not important. Why? Being in the movie in the 'forbidden' safe for a few minutes, he was killed while living his fantasy to be a rock star in a cheap bar. <br /> <br /> It's just a starter for the scat following main course. The main character, KEVIN, struggles several times to prove himself as more than a total vagina. Perhaps he succeeds in the film, but for the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin gets himself a job at the old security guard and is leaving studio lot due to his security shift in the (waiting for it). Yes, why do you make a set when you can use the studio yourself. Back to the movie. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before sunrise or else ... or else? Exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Kevin's "macho" army friend NICK, Nick's "wife" Daphne, whose character has no more dust than a bitch-sledding and prostitute outfit. There is Kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend, AMY, whose deepest desire is apparently a bad portrayal of Cher, with fishnet socks with some blue grandma pants on top. Don't ask me how it works. The most entertaining character of all is probably KYLE. How such groups of friends are made is at stake. Kyle is a twisted crawl that can't go for an hour without self-stimulation. His hobbies include sex chat lines from other people's homes and probably sniff underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as heroes search for the Hobgoblins: knee-high creatures (aka puppets) who, for some reason, try not to travel beyond the boundaries of the local area . Each of the characters ultimately lives out of their wildest fantasy that has nothing to do with millions of dollars ... or the movie has a huge budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERS START: The turn at the end of This movie will make the watcher wonder what "What?" The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by ... their own free will. Perhaps they have been waiting for sunrise to cause devastation, or the storywriters got writers' cramps and decided not to worry about the end. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "What he has learned in the army" and explodes explosives that destroy the safe, indicating the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this mountain trail; better equipped with an escalator ride. <br /> <br /> The mere badness of this movie is enough to send someone to tears. If you are planning to see it, I would first recommend some alcoholic beverages to disregard the movie.
