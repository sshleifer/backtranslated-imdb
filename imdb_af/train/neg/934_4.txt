Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as big as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What's her name was as beautiful as usual. It could have been a good movie. Too bad the plot was frightening. It was completely predictable, thin and boring. <br /> <br /> For the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by routine numbers. The characters were stock pieces cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and it completely wiped out the play. It was a pity. <br /> <br /> Finally, the writer was too bad, not the victim. Especially with the "preliminary" lines of the child, which was totally incredible. <br /> <br /> Again, this is just the play that prevented a much lower score.
