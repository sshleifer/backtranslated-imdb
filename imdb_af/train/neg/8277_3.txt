It can be incredible, but this movie has won $ 878,138 in Russia! It is displayed in almost all theater theaters and still runs! Well, I have no idea why distributors had their eye on this particular "uh" movie, which had almost no screening in the world. It's a kind of mystery! Haha! Perhaps it is based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This" along with Paris Hilton, also released just about DVD, had large-scale performances in Russia and earned more than 1mln. In addition, both movies had a lot of promotions, such as the banners around the city, TV ads and so on. Talking about the movie, I say it's boring and absolutely boring. It could be better. Even if it has Jessica Simpson.
