Why does it look? There is only one reason and that is for John Saxon's greatness. I love his acting. My favorite appearances are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1.3, and 7 as Nancy's father, a policeman, Black Christmas as a policeman, and Van Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. When I got to my local shopping mall, I came across the movie Zombie Death House and I quickly drove it back, but before I acted I noticed that John Saxon was not just an actor in this movie, but for the first time I've ever heard of a director. It irritated me (also the cheap price of $ 9.00) and I and I had to. When I got home, I realized that this movie was no longer in the Saxon's other work, even its play, which may have been disturbed by the additional pressure of regency. But it wasn't just him who sucked the other actors. They all seemed to be drawn from a recent porn shooting and have now told you to act. The film even looks like the quality of the 80's. I can't recommend this movie vividly, but if you're an obsession fan of the 80's who stayed, late-born, or a fan of crap movies if this one came out of the era . Also if you dig John Saxon like me.
