After a few hours of clearing up and having 80% of the time in complete disbelief, I can't give this garbage the turkey of the year award, no problem. To say the plot was incredible, is a great underestimate. Honestly, I'm lost to words to describe these extreme trips. Not only are the characters completely and completely without any glance at originality (these things are much better done in decades of serial killers flicks), but the acting was bad. For those who pay to see it, I hope you get your money back, for those who are paid to do so, I hope you will return your money. Believe my people there are many new issues out there that are much, much better. Go look.
