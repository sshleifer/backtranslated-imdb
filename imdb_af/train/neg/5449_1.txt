The idea is to do something interesting in the first ten minutes to keep the audience addicted. Late Night Shopping empowers to prevent long-term interest. When we get to the point, it is so monumentally moronic that I keep thinking I should have misunderstood it. But I didn't. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of an Osaka landlord who simultaneously rented the same apartment for two people, who worked different shifts and thus did not realize they had part. His friend asked, "But what about the weekends?" Sean didn't have enough explanation. Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem, that is, he is not sure his girlfriend is still at home while working at night and she works during the day so they never see each other. It has been going on for three weeks. But his friend didn't ask, "Yes, but as I said earlier, how about the weekends? You should see her. It doesn't make sense. What are you talking about, Sean? Are you on medication or something? ? But let's be generous and accept that they work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> See Sean to see if the soap and towels were used. (Bitterly he started carrying the soap with him.) But what about his girlfriend's conditioner and shampoo, sanpro and moisture catcher, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is there missing? Is Anyone Bought? In the bedroom is the shared bed made or not? Are her clothes used and exchanged for clean children? Is the laundry basket fuller? In the toilet, is the seat up or down? I mean, good sadness! <br /> <br /> And to tackle it all, Paul is planning to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still at home. Why doesn't he just call her? <br /> <br /> But it gets worse. In the last act, though no one said to Vincent where the rest of the group is going, he manages them. Lenny's love affair and Sean's girlfriend conveniently look the best friends and also manage to find the group. There is not even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is OK, but not nearly good enough to make the bad characters or annoying story. <br /> I interviewed one of the actors and promised: "No guns, no drugs, no corsets." I thought, "big". But after half an hour of tedium I shouted on the screen: "I want guns! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> It wouldn't take much to sort out these issues, but on the official site, the director boasts that the movie isn't written with the text. That's all you need to know.
