It was a disappointing movie for me. It came to me through a boxing set titled "Classic Film Noir", which was a gift from someone who knows that I usually enjoy movies that were done in that style (I have to say noir is a style, not " not a genre). I don't think it's a noir movie. There is now a tendency to mention every black and white B film made from 1947 to 1955, and the label does not always fit. There is a prosecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. It's all about the only elements I could see. There is no pervasive paranoia, or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was exaggerated and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I don't want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. However, I would like to hear what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it.
