It must be the most brutal unfunny "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a mad homeless man, can't make me laugh? Something should be wrong with this photo. This is the only movie I ever felt to walk out. I used free passes, and still feel I wanted my money back. I can completely say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOME OF DEATH. The. ONLY. worse. Movie. I laughed a lot at the cheerful scene, and that's it. Spend 2 hours in something that is billed as a comedy, get more than one laugh, right? I don't know, I think the filmmakers thought "flan" was a funny word or something. And the other running joke really knocks a dead horse.
