I didn't expect much from this TV movie. You must lower the beam as you like for the midget limbo for any TBS movie that Antonio Sabato Jr. keep busy. Yet, it even seemed to be disappointing, not to be a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> Every scene was rooted, as if someone had cut and pasted dozens of movies and TV shows with great business conspiracies in writing, leaning back and saying, "My work was done. " It's all clicks, everything predictable, and even worse, the actors are forced to seem to take it seriously (even when plot developments are ridiculous). Do yourself a favor. See "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let someone know that this is a fatal error.
