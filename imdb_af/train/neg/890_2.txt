This morning I saw this repetitive heap of vignettes on a preview screen and I was blown straight by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the movie fluttered its gaping blind spots. There is no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, say, do the self-know white people know in love? I know this is not the love accident of potato sensory inclusivity, but you can't pretend to have a movie in New York, with some of these fairly prominent members of society. Plus, you know the people who thought this ish. Crash deserves that Oscar ham hand, so where is everyone? <br /> <br /> Perhaps worse than the bizarre and deliberate socio-economic ignorance were the rightly offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusting for pretty women in wheelchairs?). This movie has the range of ways to be the worst. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing - all about every possible genre that ever goes rich with white people smoking cigarettes outside fancy restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank you, they have joined forces again for the Jumper reunion, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson. And, besides, Uma plunged a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks ruined. This is, of course, one thing in terms of its appearance, but has added an incredibly extraordinary vibe of horror to its frighteningly written scene to the poor, sweet Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I had a terrible time choosing myself the least favorite scene for the end of the film questionnaire, but it must be the Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste that makes me soul because I really like the two actors. I don't easily see myself offensive, but all I could do was scoff and look around with horror like someone's 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> A second place in this incredibly tough game of horrible things is Shia LaBeouf's clear portrayal of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act by July Christie. I don't mean the opposite, I mean it. Against this is the only explanation. I realize now that the early drive with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. Highlight. Please keep this in mind when your brain starts to leak shortly after the opening credits, which looks like it's the first New York Real World. This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, non-artistic, ineffective, pretentious, and ultimately completely separate from any real New York idea. <br /> <br /> (The extra star is for the Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach series, because it's actually pretty sweet, but it's just one bright spot that feels like hours of useless, masturbatory torment.)
