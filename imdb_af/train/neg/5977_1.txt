Wow. I don't even remember much about this movie, except that it hit. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic; A girl's parents neglected her, so this sicko PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one stored by it? Then, this strange PokeMon kidnapped Ash's mother to pretend she was the girl. I don't care if he's trying to make the girl happy, it's just gross. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a bitter brat who wanted her own way. She played with Unowns, was Entei's "daughter" and can immediately grow and shrink with the help of her father. <br /> <br /> That's pretty much everything I can remember, but I think you can take it as a hint and don't see it. (Or if you see it, don't expect much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Serious. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon, the First Movie".
