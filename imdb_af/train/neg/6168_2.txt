Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comment, blah, blah ... okay, two of my friends and I, we order Pizza, sit down and want to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something brainless, but funny like Versus. But Naked Blood sucks. It's a complete waste. Well, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is pretty outstanding. But that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. I won't summarize the plot, other people already have, I just wanted to stop the hype. But watch it and determine for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it will be. Another thing that comes to my mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - okay, John's cool ... :) 2/10
