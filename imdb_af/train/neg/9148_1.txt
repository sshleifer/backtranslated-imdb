I was looking for Imdbs bottom 100, because I thought id saw nothing as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or roller ball remake, I went wrong. Ben and Arthur both beat. <br /> <br /> This is the number one movie I've ever seen, from the myriad countless movies I've seen. Bad Direction, Bad Characters, Horrible Acting, Horrible story There's a reason nobody, but Sam ever says something positive about this movie. Sam was a terribly annoying actor, but his direction was so bad he could just overthrow Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The Director must be ashamed of his work. Unfortunately, I have to give it at least 1 star, but it deserves - to stay stars.
