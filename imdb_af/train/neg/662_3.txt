and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the author has never seen a horror movie and did not realize that every thing he wrote was clicked and hacked and perfectly parodyed in movies such as "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Among the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialogue ever written. Stupid "we're going to the prom" junk. I wanted to cling to my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There was really no need to make this movie. Leading woman is uninteresting and I thought "Her? Really? Guy is obsessive with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the spot in teams of 2! Front and back! Not a sleeping cop in his car rolled down the window and just waiting for his throat to be cut.) <br /> <br /> The serial killer just swans over kill everyone he wants without the slightest problem. No resistance to victims (or doors). No one has any protection or the least idea to fight back (or to turn the security lock into the hotel door). The people are like mentally handicapped sheep. <br /> <br /> At the door, if you're a gore fan, you'll also be disappointed. All the murder was kept out of the screen and was done - ahem - tastefully. (So ​​boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the murders is the least interesting. Most of the time, they have already taken place by the time we find out. <br /> <br /> The only cliché missing is the cat that always appears in these movies. "Oh, kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die - well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Mustache. <br /> <br /> The audience struggled and returned to the screen. It was too stupid to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage these lazy movies. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and incidentally - no coronation of a prom king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) <br /> <br /> So save your money and rent "Carrie "or" Friday the 13th "or" Halloween "or" Scream "or" Scary Movie "(any of them) to get a good fright with some original twists.
