I saw this movie during a Tolkien-themed Interim class during my second year of college. Unfortunately, I was sitting near the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a jumping boy. Everyone laughed, but they were not in constant sight. <br /> <br /> Let's get it out of the way: The films of Peter Jackson 'Lord of the Rings' are something of the Bakshi movie. For example, in Jackson's version of The Society of the Ring, the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn bed is almost a complete copy of the scene in Bakshi's movie shot by the lap. You can call this plagiarism or tribute, depending on your calendar. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the deals don't stop there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that means I have some respect for this movie. I'm sure others set out the agreements. Look around. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people have died in the accident. I decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological way. If I didn't provoke anything else that insulted me, being totally overwhelmed would be confronted with a multitude of failures (and highs, mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Due to the heavy use of rotoscope, Gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard, but a fiery punishment prophet (whose hatch changes unpredictably once or twice in the course of the movie). <br /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as "Aruman", without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam is flat apart. The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strange childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbies are small like kids, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Cheerful and Pippin is never known - they appear only during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation. The movie is filled with messy editing like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing along the way. One of the hobbies buys a lute that is at least twice as large as he is behind his back - which was not previously visible - and starts in a typical fantasy beard fashion, as they are all in la-la-lae. break. GREAT. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn is apparently a native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants), complete with a large, square pilgrim belt muscle. He's probably the worst swordsman in the whole movie. He often gets one shaky swing before knocking flat on his ass. <br /> <br /> * The Black Riders look more like lepers than threatening instruments of evil. They stop wherever they go painfully. It is disturbing to be sure, but not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders try to cross the Ford of Browns (where they stare at Frodo, riding on the other side) goes on forever, in what time the Riders are a vague threatening way their horses carry and ... do nothing else. The scene was probably meant to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline, as he dedicated his wound. It seems to be more plodding than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the Dwarf is just as long as Legolas the Elf. He is a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for it. He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome. This is a rough but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir picked Elmer Fudd's golden Viking weapon from the Bugs Bunny opera episode. He looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarity with Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog is crying and the least threatening villain in the whole movie. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers, and it's barely higher than Gandalf. "Puriste" may prefer this Balrog, but I will take Jackson's version every day. <br /> <br /> * The fighting tones are uncomfortable and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters show any level of competence with their weapons. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movie, but they have to fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I'm sorry he made it difficult to get to everyone. Look at the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Well, now for the GOOD parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some of the voters are pretty good. It's not that Aragorn SOUNDS is bad, he looks just like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this depiction; like Tom Bombadil, she looks immune to the Ring's temptation, and her voice actress is not terrible either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as heartbreaking as Jackson's depiction of the same scene, but it is still appropriately dramatic (and more true of his death in the book, although I do not believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it as it did). <br /> <br /> * As my professor pointed out (between whispered threats), the Orcs (especially at Helm Deep, if I'm correct) look like war-ravaged bodies of soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what is being tried. <br /> <br /> * While it's not really a positive point about the movie, Bakshi can't be blamed for most of the failures in this movie, or so I said - the project was on a tight budget and late in his production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups (who I probably didn't read the books). <br /> <br /> Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi to try and try somewhere. depended on this size. I just have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't even recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy, unless you've read all the books and have your own visualizations of characters, places and events. I'm sure someone will choose a copy of this somewhere in confusion; If you do, keep an open mind and make sure you can.
