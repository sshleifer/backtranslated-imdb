According to me, this movie is not a new idea. It looks like I'm taking a spear on a spear without looking to the side! The director has an agenda! Duh! I find that she lacks rationality, there is no place for the alternative view. I am for one usually on the side of the naysayer, but this movie does not have credibility because it relies on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street. Really now, if you want to make a credible alternative to a belief that is held for 2000+ years, you need to make more effort so that the other side can express their faith. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, because I am a non-believer, but leave the beliefs of others, and do not want them to stumble did not, but tried to understand and tolerate.
