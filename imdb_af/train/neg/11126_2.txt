Of all the movies I saw, this one is almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and some others like to reach rock bottom.) It is in a hurry, the story is shaky and the events depicted has been poorly performed. Of course we have to put it at the book writer's door. The book filmed by the movie is indignant and illogical. Oprah gives a tasty look to Bigger's mother, but is not nearly at her potential. Other well-known artists also seem to be the worst. The plot that revolves around an African American who decided to take a job as a driver. When he manages the family daughter after a communist dinner, he becomes known. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he gets home, he puts her in bed, but she starts to rest. The blind mother (yes) hears it, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead chokes her. Now he is really in trouble of killing a white girl, he does, who would do any logical thinking - he kicks her in the coal oven. So investigators perform a missing person and look at the furnace (the idiot does not have the prospect of getting rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and last hour or so is turbulent segments of the courtroom. Desperate for A bad movie, this one can do the job, but if you really want to learn about cultural issues in the 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are far better options.
