OK, it's very rare for me to complain about something I got for free. So I think this movie pushed me over the limit. I saw it for free at the Hollywood Cemetery and walked away very disappointed. One observer's question to the director about using native American references, just like "books," rather than being better in the movie, basically says everything that this movie failed. <br /> <br /> NATIVE US REFERENCES --- The native American references really felt out of place and confronted. Obviously, this director and writer has tried to tackle an arena they never played before. They had to hold onto the old expression of "writing about something you know". If they were actually aware of this, it certainly did not show on the movie whether the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clichés and ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to watch this movie on the basis that it was an indie. So I kept it up to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before becoming so popular. Before it even came to great release, I already realized how it would be a hit. Indifferently I could not say the same about "Expiry date". "Sunshine" took us to cliché incidents, but the filmmakers were so clever in their approach that the outcome would make us a different direction to avoid the fall of a "cliche". This movie, on the other hand, had no way of falling into the trap, as it was already from the beginning. The psycho's antics, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that, but the best and WORST movie I've seen this year was both India. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn from their family members at the cemetery.
