This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who have never been a big fan of Corner Gas, but initially I kept it until it came in the first half of the season. All the jokes were played and the characters had nothing to do with them. Well, at least Corner Gas was good in the first place, Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically terribly mean CBC comedy that doesn't run out of episode 1. Who are the people who watch this show anyway, I'm honest, are they old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't find it himself, the jokes are completely predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it will no longer last, because all the success this show has, seems to me to be entirely based on the assumption that this show is Muslim that could and should have led to a good performance.
