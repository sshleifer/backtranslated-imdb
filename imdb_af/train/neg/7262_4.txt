There are some wonderful ideas in this violent film that, if clearly performed, can elevate it from spaghetti western melting to something special. Unfortunately, a TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! Scenes start and end suddenly, leaving characters for long regions, the performances (and accents) of the actors are fairly inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) revolutionary who, after taking part in a village, remains a priest (!) ... ten years later, the town becomes "mayor" Telly Salavas manages. Stella Stevens is looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau is looking for Shaw. They all suddenly shout at each other and they shoot each other a lot. Fernando Rey is also there (like a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are extremely uneven. Savalas sometimes has an emphasis, just like Landau (which really roster here). Shaw and Rey prove that they are not able to really give themselves embarrassment and Stevens looks pretty foxy (if it is a bit out of the sweaty dirt).
