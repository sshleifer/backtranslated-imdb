Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) has wandered to a post-apocalypse desert (after her protector has died of old, the protector played by Elias Koteas, a real decent actor) and now she finds that people are wandering through The rubble is looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. She leads a group of burned cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two entries, but it is still a largely dull feature. The problem of this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast like McDowell, Katt and Galligan is given little to do. Haje is indeed a cunning heroine and Lynch is over (as usual) and the film does not have the inspiration or ambition to be so nice, as it is hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is just boring.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle that almost aggressively resists any good idea. As an action movie, it is routine and through the numbers B movie stuff and it has been made proficient, that is the only thing I can say positively. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Poor)
