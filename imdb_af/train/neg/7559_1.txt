It must be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It is slow, dull, amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can't blame them. They gave a manuscript of such an absolute banality. All they can do is through them with a pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with the evil deeds in SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> There is not one moment in this movie where rings are true - not an honest line or a single moment the one moves. The character of the Nicholas Cage is so badly drawn that one does not feel a smuggling of compassion for him through his tribulation. I have no doubt I am seeing a suffering man there, but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
