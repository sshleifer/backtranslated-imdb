With this cast and budget you will expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a number of movies that border on the strange but still work. Neither she, his sister, nor Sir Ben can do anything to save this travesty of poorly written rubbish. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing more than a series of siggats and poor ones. The plot goes nowhere, the writing is devised, senseless and the characters paper thin. If you think of a movie as three-dimensional where the story and characters bring the image into the depth, this stinker comes as flat as a steamer microphone. Dan Akroyd's appearance in it brought memories of another. really terrible movie, 1991's Nothing, but Trouble. Frankly, this movie is the type of project that kills careers and dismisses agents.
