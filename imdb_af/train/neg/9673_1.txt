"Plants are the most wicked and malignant of all life forms", one dopey victim in "The Seedpeople", a stupid, flaming remake of "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers", "Day of the Triffids", and a thousand udder moewe. And why are seeds moors dangerous if plants, one can ask? Because, according to the same thing, "seeds can drive us". Yes, I can remember a terrible incident when the MooCow was just a calf, which has been chased from the school by the naked dandylion seed by the school. Yes, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this cunning little turkey look like rough little muppets, some of which rotate like wicked tumble, others that go on strings. There is not even the slightest incline of terror or tension to be found here. For reasons that are left unexplained, the seed samples are knocked out with 50 volts of ultraviolet light, although they can lie around in the daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000 times more UV energy. As you can see, there is not much thought in this cow flop. The MooCow says you should throw your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
