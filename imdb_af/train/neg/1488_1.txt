I had to register for IMDb just to comment on how terrific this movie is ... my cats and a crew have a better story than that. Not the worst play I've ever seen, but if you wipe out almost the entire movie in 5 minutes, it's a bit to be desired. There wasn't a single 'scare' moment in the movie, except when watching the movie 'Halloween' on the TV. All around, it seems to have been a good story, could roll the credits and say that Chasey Lain was in it, a bit of a loss, because I didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already before I could I have said 'oh yes, there she is'. I'm so glad I saw it in a hotel and didn't pay for it, because I would really have chosen if I paid a penny to see it. I usually find or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. It's so bad it isn't even that great, it's bad. It's just bad.
