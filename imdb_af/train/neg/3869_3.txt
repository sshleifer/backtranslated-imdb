It's the 2nd time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These comments come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be wonderful, worthy movies. But the rest of the Welles career has unfortunately been wasted on material that is unworthy of his talent and faint to resist his cinematic embroidery. And if he makes a pot boiler like Shanghai, the lack of anything to hang his cinematic tricks is just as sad. I couldn't tell you what he had been exploring here. It's all as fashioned as Welle's divine Irish brother; That takes a lot of effort but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Welles projects have become this over-developed and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose a version, any version) is a similar project. The material is unimportant. It just can't bear the weight of all this noodling. For a director who deals in reality-based drama (like here), he never feels any trace to tie his bundle of mind back to reality; or a coherent story. The murder-for-hire scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos told Welles, because Hayworth cut her hair and got the thing out of her. The camera loves her. She is the classic, most exciting, immersive and surprising femme fatale ever put on film. But her betrayal comes so late in the film, it feels like a desperate decision, so the movie will have a genre that suits it. The movie cannot be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When everything in L.F.S. said, are the revolutions all for what? To convince you that you have seen something considerate? to give Welles more? To make you roll? Welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story, or to tell a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai should say to anyone who is not a crippled billionaire, arranges a four-thousand-murder-for-hire scheme, or a fanboy who falls in love with non-meaning or substantive filmic concepts. <br /> <br /> Overworked, impeccable, unengaging.
