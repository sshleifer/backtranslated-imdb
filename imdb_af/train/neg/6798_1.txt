It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved must be ashamed. Everyone. Ice-T is miserable, the dialogue is absolutely horrible, and hokie doesn't begin to describe the performances by every actor in this movie. The plot steals heavily from the Executive Decision, but compared to Air Rage, the Executive Decision is the Oscar material. I have never been so disappointed when I watched a movie. Air Rage must be burned with its ashes locked in a safe, never to see the light of day again. Anyone who saw it should take a shower and wash the stink of the horrible movie of their wash. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end when the credits rolled. It was easily the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T must stick to law and order, and the other people in this movie must retire early or commit suicide. Anyway, they should never try to be in a movie again.
