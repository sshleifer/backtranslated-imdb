Well, I start by acknowledging that I'm not a John Ford fan. (I watched "The Informer" just because I tried my way through a list of "greats".) If so, just move along, because you won't agree with me. /> <br /> What an overwhelming and dated piece of cowardice is it! I would say there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution), but Ford is usually determined to bury it under overworking and cheap sentiment. I think it's a bit interesting to take a moment to watch the less-than-seamless transition made from the silence to the "talkies" - the acting styles of some of the principals have that over-built endemic to early movies and movies feel as if they can play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (Of course, title cards will prevent Ford from recovering six times each time emotion.) What dialogue is usually a "They're always after my Lucky Charms!" quality that is exacerbated by the fact that every actor has been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are useful to remind us that we are in Ireland because the sets tend to be caught up in the fact that some German expressionist pieces are being filmed on the next soundtrack. (It feels like you're looking at an eagle's eye that some villagers are flipping Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> Techniques change. Taste changed. So I'm not wondering how crazy it seems that this film was so arguing in his day. But that's not one of the classic things that stop --- more just "fair warning" about the kind of simplified malarkey that Ford is going to dedicate to his career.
