<br /> <br /> The movie starts out as an ordinary comic hero movie. It's about the boy being picked up, has no parents and loves the school's # 1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there's nothing you can't guess in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that he or she is not a good actor, or that no actor in the world can save a script like this. Perhaps children around the age of ten can enjoy the movie, but it is a bit violent for the youngest. You can't get away from movies like X-Men, Batman and Spawn. All the titles are better. I walked out almost the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good was the computer animation, BUT it is not even in the Christmas tree! So my recommendation: Don't see this movie even if you are paid for it!
