I try to be very objective when I see a low budget movie. I also use a lower weight on independent and low budget productions versus big budget productions. I expect almost flawlessness in large budget productions and their studios. Therefore, I apply stricter criteria to the large studio releases. But this movie was just a dud. Period. The point of departure was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a senior high school with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or her play that drew you into her world. To make this movie more mysterious, the lighting in some scenes has not set the mood, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Another disappointing movie I could only give three points.
