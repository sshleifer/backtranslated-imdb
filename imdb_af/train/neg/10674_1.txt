This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the play is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer even a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but totally unreasonable. The makeup is so bad, it is worth mentioning. I mean, who ever think of the makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone has to tell the makeup artist and the DOP that you shouldn't actually see it. The end is a massive disappointment - in the line of "and then they realized it was all a dream." <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money. You're better off staring at the room just 2 hours.
