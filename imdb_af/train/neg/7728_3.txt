.... this mini doesn't get better with age. I saw it and it was successor when it was originally aired and so many others were blown away. In early 2002 I borrowed the novels for both WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. I then decided to see both again and invest $ 200 plus on the DVD sets. I looked at both minis again in painful detail and realized I had done things backwards - I had bought the novels and borrowed the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Don't believe it's abysmally miscast? Read the novels and see for yourself. Don't think it's dated? Screen it for someone who is not old enough to see it originally, and to look at the reaction you get (warning - reactions of such people range from horror to horror). <br /> <br /> According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself selected Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production quality, music scoring, dialogue - a big story has turned into a late-70's soap opera by an over-ambitious producer / director who was over his head. This thing was dated the minute it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great when the original broadcast and those of us they saw drag on a nostalgic rope that reminds us of younger days. IMO - this mini doesn't live up to its reputation and is very disappointed.
