"A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf, based on a family legend of an ancestor accused of being murdered because he is one. Because of her previous treatment by men, she travels the countryside, seduces and kills the men she meets To fall in love with a man, her life looks better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs.The woman is again through these latest events traumatized and the woman returns to her violent ways Rino Di Silvestro's "La lupa mannara" begins with full front, writhing, groaning dance by beautiful blonde Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs. The opening flashback reveals her furry ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature, Ms. Borel is unfortunately not a werewolf, she is just a very strong insane. <br /> <br /> As a movie would "Werewolf Woman" (in English) had been better if Borel's character was really a female werewolf; with her sexual victimization a great deal of characterization. But until the 1970s skin and blood flash went, it's hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either naked or sexually dressed by the film, which contains a fair amount of gratuitous gore. Gorgeous Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporting players.
