I thought this movie was a decay, I expected it would be so much better than it was. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this movie and I didn't sit in this movie. Where to start this movie, the play in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall story of this movie was not special. I thought this movie was supposed to be good, but it was no more than a cheesy waste of time. I think the acting in this movie wasn't terrific of the actors in this movie, it just wasn't there. I think if we had another actor, Kirk as Jay Baruchel might have been better, but the whole time I watched this movie, he looked high and I didn't feel like he was in this movie does not act. Alice Eve has done a good job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were not names and had very little influence in this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all. There were a few liners in this movie that were OK, but nothing worth saying to your friends they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time because he couldn't decide whether he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he should stick to Burger King advertising. I think this movie might have been better if the authors went to another director. The storyline of this movie is just like any other hot girl, just OK old love story, boring, I think it would have been better if it had more originality, but nothing dark. I honestly would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. I think you'll have more fun with the dentist than this movie. So save yourself the pain and don't see it.
