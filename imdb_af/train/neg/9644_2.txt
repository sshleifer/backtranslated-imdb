First thing first. In this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music, and that's where Mr. Shankar and his party failed. <br /> <br /> Music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who removed a letter 'A' from his spelling, did good work, but was not useful for a bad movie like this. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll used to entertain the public, although its good to watch, but its role in the movie is to dance, actually its dance member of a rock group and I don't think there is a rock band that is dancer than a bandmate. <br /> <br /> In film this movie is a piece of shit a piece of *** t. watch it if you want to be deceived.
