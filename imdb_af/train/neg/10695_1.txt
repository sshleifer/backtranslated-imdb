... I read about this movie somewhere in the internet and very much criticized for how bad and sucking this movie was. And I couldn't vote anymore. Then I watched this movie on DVD, and I remembered it twice and then came commercially from this movie on TV. Fortunately, I saved my money for these crap pieces. I donated my sleep to this movie and it soon turned out that this movie couldn't satisfy me. So I can't judge how the movie was made, but anyway ... it still sucks. As for those who had this movie, I would apologize for flaming this movie and telling you how sucking this movie is. I don't know what you think of this movie?
