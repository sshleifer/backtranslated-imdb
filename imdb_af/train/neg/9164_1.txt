I have to predict this by saying I'm a great romantic. That's why I wanted to keep this movie. So I write my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt seeing it. The Springtime tells the destination-filled story of Li-Ann who falls to the supreme Jeremy and commits them to meet every leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't feel like you're watching another Jack Neo movie. Then why is it so bad? First, I feel the filmmakers thought they shot a music video because they chose to replace storytelling and any real emotions with cheesy settings, predictable actions and click lines. I am both upset and embarrassed to be one of the first couple in Singapore to watch the Spring Years, but those of us in the movie agree that we've been reluctant to speak to critical performances volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that will surpass Forever Fever, the best Singapore romantic comedy so far, and the leap years aren't even close. Some blogs call it The Crap Years which is hard but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or your emotions as I did. The movie will give you love forever.
