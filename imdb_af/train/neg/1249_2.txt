What a disappointment, especially in the light of the supply budget, the available technical resources and the talent that came together. Is not the fundamental rule of science fiction / drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of unbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible start and sucks us in, but then forget about it. Burton says his filmmakers have their brains. The remaining libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimpanzee, the worthlessness of man's snooping, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary horse-racing skills (it is an astronaut and a group of human primitive who suddenly reaches full tilt), the massive and immediate human uprising is all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never produces any sense of true fear, danger or emergence in this world upside down. Compare with the original, in which Chuck Heston's nudity captured his greatest helplessness and astonishment in turn metaphorically. The uniform Wahlberg retains its modesty but also its sheer sense of management and control in an inherent difficult situation, and we never really wonder about its well-being. Unlike Heston, he never seems to be in real danger. Tim Burton had to make use of the f / x budget for a few skilled scripts. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers have ever bothered to establish writers' writers and directors. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could do as well as they did in Planet of the Apes. I will bet that the repetition of these efforts will not exist. It could have been a new franchise, and a wonderful new step for imagination. Losing another opportunity.
