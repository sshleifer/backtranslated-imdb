Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Do you stamp your head on Ecstasy pipes? There were so many of you. Did you do this for a dare? Is this a kind of cult? Or did Guy Richie itself report 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I'll say it. Just because you don't understand a movie doesn't mean it's not good. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a movie after you had a ride with your wife and not been in the mood. Perhaps there is a more fundamental stumbling block - as you just don't have the spiritual capacity or a highly developed philosophical sense to get involved with it. BUT. And it is a very, very big but. The XXL elephant-size mega-but ends all buttons. <br /> <br /> Please do not confuse inconsistency for complexity, and do not confuse this two-hour non-squirrel with an interesting movie. Really. You may think you're pretty smart. You can even think of yourself as a bit of a romantic figure: an independent thinker who combats a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. Please do not. You grant yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of everyone's time. If you thought you would recognize it for a few minutes. It was a waste of the throw, a waste of the crew, a waste of caterers, and definitely a waste of precious minutes (you can't get them back) from anyone who is unhappy enough to get through this impeccable , miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait," comes a voice in the dark. "You just don't understand. It's NOT LINE. That means the story doesn't go in a straight line. It's actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTHOR. It addresses difficult EXISTING questions. And in each case - they did FIGHT CLUB when it first came out - didn't you hear it because they couldn't handle the COMPLEXITY They now eat a humble circle. <br /> <br /> Hate to disappoint you but I'm quite a big Lynch fan, but I prefer Memento, such a narrative that is told in an unconventional way, doesn't necessarily fill me with fear, and although I briefly studied it a few years ago philosophy is very interesting to me, I do not like Revolver for these reasons, I do not like it, because it claims that it is about weighty, large-minded subjects, but it does so in such an insultingly superficial way as to be ridiculous I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​chess is like that of a provisional four year old. I don't like it because the characters, without exception, have alienated me completely. "Ha!" calls the Richie apolog. "Guy beats his hat on Brecht!" Maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can't write a decent script for toffee. <br /> <br /> The comparison of Revolver with Fight Club is actually very informative. Fight Club has an acid-tongue, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has a solid fortune cookie that rejects one-liners that bleed your ears. Fight Club has a big twist that makes you reconsider what happened. Revolver has, as far as I can tell, a number of incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction, because ... they do not make sense. If you stretch the bottom of people among the people, they will eventually kick you out of their home. And then they close all the doors and windows. And they never let you back. Always. Guy Richie seems to accept that it is philosophical to repeat a mantra of small buzz phrases. They are usually spoken, but they often flash on the screen with attributions. It's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly remarkable is the way something so incomprehensible can be so married to all the tired gang cliches in the world. Eventually it is so unimportant. You don't care about it. You don't understand anything. You go home. <br /> <br /> Actually, there was a little I really liked: the incessant killer who has a confidence crisis. He is wonderful. But I can't recommend watching the movie just to see him. He's just a few minutes in it. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It's awful.
