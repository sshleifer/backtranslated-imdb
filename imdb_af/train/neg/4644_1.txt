This movie is terrible. The story is about a woman trying to figure out what happened to her sister. The film is struggling with its identity, which stretches from Noir / thriller to erotic, with elements of horror being thrown in well. The film has a very confused structure, for example, with regular use of flashbacks without tying it into the story. The plot was poorly developed, and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who and what they played. Some inconsistencies exist in many movies, but the scene where the main characteristic wants to guide a virtual stranger at his home, agrees to go alone (where he says she will find a phone), less the gun she brought To call the police was too hard to believe. Some of the cinematography is very poor: we watched a 42 "TV, so how someone with a smaller set can figure out what happens in the scenes that is almost complete darkness is outside of me. Overall, a chaotic mess.
