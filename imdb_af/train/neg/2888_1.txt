To compare this peer to an old, low-budget porn movie would be an insult to the old, low-budget porn movie. The animal scene has no meaning, nor does it represent this man and his crimes, even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The summary on the back of the DVD case says, in part, "an attack on the BTK killer's terrorist government." This is NOT a resell. A re-declaration would indicate that you are telling the truth about what happened or how or why. None of these things is true. I am an enthusiastic study of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly, it's NOT one of them. It's not even about the BTK killer. Save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead. This serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you have to watch this movie for yourself, watch it for free in your local library and even then you will still be deceived.
