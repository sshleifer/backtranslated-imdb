Sometimes I rest my mind and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made. They have made these "Jaws" copies since the 70's, not as they become more popular. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First, it captures a few secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a few nobodies, except for someone who was a little more familiar, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the other kills the animal, usually with an explosion. Then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or eggs have been laid. Etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas, and makes absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. Unless you are the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation, then your standards are pretty low. It's funny that he is played by Duncan Regehr, but he likes to be completely Zorro. Hi, I'll give it a bonus point.
