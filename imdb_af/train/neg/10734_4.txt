I have read another negative review of this movie. I think I must have missed something. The start is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in another empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. That's the best part. After the three go their separate ways, divide the movie into three threads. This is when boredom works. Certainly, the thread with the Fellinian baby cushion that makes puppets from chewed bread is first an eye-catcher. Unfortunately, the director killed the one, even injecting a wild plot line that does not lead in particular. Bottom line: A two-hour plot-thin listlessness. If you suffer from insomnia, see it in bed and you will have a good night sleep.
