Unless you understand miserable remains, this movie won't mean much to you. An attempt has been made to raise a bit of humanity in a cold and deceptive period consumed by alcohol and drugs. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak does her big disco number, her voice is so clear. the name is pathetic - the producers could at least get someone who sounded remotely like her. <br /> <br /> The documentary document recently played on television is much better and gives a much bigger picture of the era of our history. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mikey Myers, can be accused of acting; However, he does an incredible job.
