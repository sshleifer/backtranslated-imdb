I found the movie offensive to Americans who lost someone in the towers for American people in general. If a tribute to horrible facts happened, each director had the opportunity to polemise with old facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack) or criticize America's political behavior or to compare different political situations as they own. country that has nothing to do or share with the atrocities of September 11. Shame on them.
