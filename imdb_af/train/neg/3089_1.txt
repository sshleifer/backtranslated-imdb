This movie is so bad, it's comical. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, the television program in which three characters watch and parody use bad movies, used this movie to mock. I suggest watching it (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see Hobgoblins if you are not willing to stop within the first scene. Actually, don't see this movie, period. Please. At least not serious. His jokes are not funny (and least), and you will parade much more fun or look at a parody and then watch the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick to look, so save yourself. Read a book. Do the laundry. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
