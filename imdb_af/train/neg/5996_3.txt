Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> With: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds is GO! <br /> <br /> And so, Thunderbirds, a childhood favorite of mine, started. When I heard they would make a Thunderbird movie, I was ecstatic. I can't wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar to save people while Thunderbird 4 dives deep into the dive? You get the idea. I just couldn't wait. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics poked it, but I still wanted to go. As long as the heart was in the same place, it was all that was important to me. So I sat down in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50? Everyone was over thirty and under ten. Surely the most awkward theater experience I've ever had? <br /> <br /> The film (intended to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days and wishes he can save people like the rest of his family, but he is too young. One day he finally got his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) stuck the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5 (the space station). It involves devouring The Hood's henchmen and saving his family on time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once it touches on film? What a mess we have on our hands. First, the movie was meant for children, just like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults, and we gave plots that were pretty advanced for children's programming. However, it plunges off the plot as it tries to solve the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that seeks to appeal to Thunderbirds series kids and kids while they both miss. Lame jokes, cartoon sounds and dumb antics that no one really enjoys are everywhere in this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wishes he'd never rectified it. <br /> <br /> Everyone, everyone had a solid performance, considering the writing they were all given. Ben Kingsley was extraordinary as The Hood, and played the part very well. My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood's henchmen, who are reduced to surplus old Looney Tunes cartoons. They are so surprising enough that the children are comfortable with it. <br /> <br /> What's strange about this movie is that while watching the movie, I had fun. But as soon as the lights went up, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I was $ 8 lighter and two hours of my time was gone. A guilty pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds is a forgetful mess. Instead of a big "go", I recommend staying away from this movie. If the rest of the movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it, it would have been an incredible movie worthy of the Thunderbird name. However, we get a movie that only bother the stubborn Thunderbirds fans (if you want to tear your childhood) or the extremely bored. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
