The acting was terrific as well as the script. It was poorly merged and made you almost laugh at the various horrific acts of murder. The end was even worse. Everyone died, but somehow it made everything perfectly good! They didn't give enough history about the obsession the teacher had. The movie needs more time to develop a better story. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel so bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could really have made it an OK movie, but the script and play failed.
