A good impressive, funny disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) being investigated for his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are being held against a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, is the detective assigned to challenge the thief? she's one shot to prove he's innocent and worthy of his position. Send a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions to repair an item from the banker's safe deposit box stored in the bank, and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, you get everything in the movie and nothing is finally paid. Denzel Washington is in its most uninteresting way in an ineffective and improper self-centered performance. The only saving grace for the film is his capable co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the movie itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance that plays against the type as a relentless, bad villain. Clive Owen is not given much to do except bread, but the depth of his presence and performance has more than his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little influence or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee thought when creating this movie. However, the most confusing aspect of Inside Man is how much unfair praise it has received. For a movie that looks all the intention of a pre-summer excitement, this one suddenly falls flat.
