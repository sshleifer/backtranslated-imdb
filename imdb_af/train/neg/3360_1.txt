Somewhere in his non-fiction book, DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King, suggests that one secret of scary writing is to prevent your readers from seeing exactly what a terrible thing behind the door is waiting for them. If finally the door burst open and a mistake goes through ten feet long, the reader may be a little scared, but he will also think: "Well, I can handle it. At least it wasn't a HUNDRED feet long. "There is nothing more frightening than what we, invisible and unknown, just waiting on the other side of that dense cover waiting for you to get you. <br /> <br /> The HAUNTING is so completely misunderstood that Jan De Bont, director, more or less begins his movie by opening and shouting him metaphorically, "Look, everyone is watching! It's a ten foot long mistake! Isn't it SCARY?! " The right of diminishing returns kicks in immediately. By the end of the movie, the director was almost up and down, jumping CGI pots and pans crazy, shouting, "Look, everyone, look! Here are ten HUNDRED foot-tall bugs! now, here are a hundred DUOUSAND foot-big mistakes! "<br /> <br /> The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this quest (and there are many). They can't and don't. In fact, impressive as it is, the special effects are so persistent and intrusive that the distracted viewer wakes up on them - whether in admiration or annoyance - instead of deepened in a story. <br /> <br /> To me the nadir of this movie's stupidity comes when a statue, with "blood" jumping out of the mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (like Dr. Marrow) in a fountain . The filmmakers clearly did not know what to do with this alleged idea when they had it, so they only beat Neeson in the water, hit a little and beat his arms and went slippery. At the next scene, the good doctor apparently wiped himself off and he forgot all about the annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel appears to have been in this ridiculous script by a committee plunged by the low IQ teenagers who thought how to scare people was to make each effect bigger and harder : "Well, now, let's go, make the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face, and, come down on her ... and all these spooky things like catching her in bed." > <br /> The only saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it eventually becomes so terrible that it's actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O 'Death, I almost fell on the floor and laughed. <br /> <br /> Poor building, witless, grotesquely heavy hands, totally incredible, and filled with clunky dialogue and useless scenes, this vacant HAUNTING is a handbook example of not making a horror movie.
