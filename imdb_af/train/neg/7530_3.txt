I found this movie boring, monotonous and rather uninteresting with a hurry, level "exciting" ending that wasn't true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of horrible events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news, just not my idea of ​​a viewable, interesting movie and I became very tired of the theme of a single note and could Don't wait for the end. I almost stopped halfway up. The whole movie just seems useless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressed and unpleasant, although the play was good. A small movie with small ambitions and a small appeal - sorry, but it just didn't make me and I like good, small movies! This one just didn't walk, though I kept watching it hoping and trusting it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local judges put it on their "Year's 10 Best" list. I'd rather watch "The House of Sand" rather - now there's a good, small movie!
