The youthful group in "St Elmo's Fire", which recently graduated from college, seems scarce to make it at high school much less four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-author and director, Joel Schumacher, seems to be a generation for them. With an outdated movie of "up and comers", a background score similar to those of "Terms of Endearment" and writing the smugness of this circle about us, "Fire" is a bad flame, one It gets even more embarrassing than the years go by. * 1/2 of ****
