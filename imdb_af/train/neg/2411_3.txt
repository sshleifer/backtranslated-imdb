Hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother, was shot by a gang driving down the street who had previously fought with him. Desperate, Rick calls his scientist partner to bring the latest formula they are doing that brings ill blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on a human or even a dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back. He gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So Rick 911 calls and the body is just taken away for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh. Now Rick needs to get his zombie brother before the entire hood is transformed into a neighborhood. Cutting off the living dead is one piece of trash. The plot is a direct rip from Resident Evil, the acting is just terrific especially with Rick's false cry for his brother. The guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired, it sends sparks, and the makeup is just lame. It's just fake blood falling over the actors. The zombies are also changing. They run, growl and have to be shot in the heart to die! Zombies just have to scuffle, groan, and have to be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so terrible, the outreaches are the only real good moment of this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there, but it only succeeds as a low budget ring.
