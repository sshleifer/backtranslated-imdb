This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies I've ever seen! See sections 1 and 2, but don't let anyone say it's better than the first two! I really mean, you don't make a movie, then make a sequel to the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would have been good if it didn't become a "Home Alone" movie, but they made it a Home Alone movie. Culkin is too old now, so you have to stop prosecuting! Goodness, this movie makes me sick! Buy part 1 and 2.
