This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can't save it. A poor story, poorer writing and just a bad direction makes it an outstanding horror movie. The outstanding part is that this is the only horror movie I can honestly say, I will never look again. This garbage makes Plan nine out of outerspace like oscar material.
