Visually irreconcilable and full of self, the director apparently opted for the faux-depth to expand a 5-minute plot to an 81-minute snorkeling festival. <br /> <br /> The moments in this movie are VERY limited, and the characters don't even feel like it. How can you invest in a main character made so surreal? <br /> <br /> Substantive AND stylistic, it all feels like a strange dream sequence. Illegal camera work, awkward silence and gaps in action, and what is the small spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of it should go back to the film school. It didn't matter, just cheese, and didn't even work stylistically with the rest of the film (assuming the movie even had a style that is a close call). What a flop.
