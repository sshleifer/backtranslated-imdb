I mean, really, how can Charles Band leave the full moon head a total stinkball like DEMONICUS. I mean it should never get the green light to start with. The story is repetitive, the characters are poor at best, there is no real story about Tyranus, then he is a bad man. Then their writer or director goes out for a bad end. It's really a bad end, Demonicus is rising. The last survivor escapes a deadly cave, then a picture of Chimera comes to life, cheap I can add and pursue her. Then while she goes home, it's FUNHOUSE. A statue that was destroyed centuries ago appears for no reason just to fall on top of her. I mean it doesn't make sense. What the hell was Charles thinking that this stack is being played, with four different movie companies, they were desperate for movies. They could have asked me, I have better ideas than DEMONICUS. Thanks TURKEY.
