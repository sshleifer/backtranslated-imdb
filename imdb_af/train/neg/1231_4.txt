Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a top class housewife living in a private suburban apartment with her twin children and her abused husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their home and her appearance and upsets Kenneth. On the Christmas Eve, she drives to the local shopping center to buy patchwork for the gifts, and she finds no parking space available. When she sees an old car parked in two places, she leaves a message to the owner who calls him 'selfish jerk'. When the mall closes, is Della's car held by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the security guard of the mall protects her, he is shot on the head by Chuckie, Della accelerates her car to escape the criminals. But she dropped her truck near a bush while chasing the gang. She takes the toolbox and hides in the forest and fights the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A few days ago I saw the trailer of While She Was Out and I was anxious to watch the DVD. . Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I am totally disappointed with this dull and unbeatable collection of clicks. Della Myers is presented as an unsafe and neglected housewife and non-existent woman; Motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family. She is pursued by four common criminals, but she defeats them with a toolbox that resembles Batman's belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of American films, with an African-American, a Chinese-American and a Latin, along with an American gentleman to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent performance, but their children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While Out")
