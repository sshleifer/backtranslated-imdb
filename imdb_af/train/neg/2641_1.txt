Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and indescribable. It carries nothing of a true human story, death and sowing. It's a Hollywood parody, with trumpet music bits reminiscent of a Denzel Washington movie, wobble camera shots and focus, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalog. It's made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life comes from viewing famous names. The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that goes with it. I feel like an idiot to look at it, save yourself.
