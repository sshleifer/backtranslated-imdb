TV affects society ... just look at the surge in the popularity of cappuccino stores after this plain piece of work debut. Besides, real people who look as good as these people do, they have no problems. <br /> <br /> In addition, anyone really believes these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft, considering what they're doing for a living? NBC likes to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if it's just about Gump's level. I know a person who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2200 a month. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a show called Phriends, where it's six ugly nobody's in dead-end jobs, living in a cramped environment where siren is constantly crying and someone is being annoyed weekly ... and then the landlord charges the rent. Now I would look.
