Not a movie, but a lips synchronized collection of acts from acts that were part of the British Invasion, which followed from the dynamic entrance of the Beatles to the music world. Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the dam, but many did. Featured are: Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and of course the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It is so much fun to watch these young acts before they cut and polish their deeds.
