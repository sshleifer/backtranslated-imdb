Comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigates eccentric farm family in Maryland who have never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts pressure on the not-so-untapped taxman. Debbie has definitely made her part of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period - and this is no better or worse than the rest. Picture starts bright, but flags on the halfway become frantic and whitish. Randall is not a bad game for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself is chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a poor sound mix that causes all the actors to sound like they are sitting in an echo room. ** of ****
