I have nothing at all, but this Stephen King derivative is scrubbed too fresh, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new teenager in a small town who is a "sleepwalker" - a cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and feeding on the blood of female virgins, calls for a more mysterious, ambiguous treatment. . This thriller gets an inappropriate colorful look, with almost any atmosphere. The children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother. Kridge, of "Ghost Story", never broke out of the filler-female form, and it's a huge loss that she's no longer used. Her performance is creepy and intense, and suggests that 'Sleepwalkers' could be a much better movie with a different focus and stiffer direction. It is too exaggerated and commercially driven, with a disparate tone that swings from the thriller to drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, like real-life directors, John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
