It was a complete disappointment. The play is not bad, but the production was just so bad I sometimes felt I had to stop it, but unfortunately I worked it out and could make it a bit embarrassed for the whole poor movie. This is OK. if you like me with cheesy moral plots and not mind watching a movie abusing Whitman. If you want a cheesy fictional story go for it.
