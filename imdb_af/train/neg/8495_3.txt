I am the kind of person who went to the local library and read books about Babbage's difference engine while my schoolmates are soccer. Play. So, if there is something like a target audience for this movie, I think I'll probably be in it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should see it again. A previous reviewer mentioned not watching this movie while tired. Maybe it was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this movie, and there are aspects of what I love, but overall I found it amateurish and very plowed. <br /> <br /> Being a bit of a self-confident computer nerd just can't help me get to the exact time frame when the movie is actually made, and how the complicated graphics reflect that time (ie 1997). Played games of the era c.f. "Mind Grind" to name one example, this movie cannot escape that 16-bit color-low-res multimedia blast of that time. Now fortunately, in the recent years, it has been slightly reduced in the game world in favor of the real game. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie through a German FTA satellite channel (like I don't) I think it was ever broadcast on the British FTA TV, but not recently), I was generously amused by the see final credit note. Gottdog (Godshond) has 4 people in designing the design. Perhaps it is my mind to be amused by this, since ten years have passed since the film was made, but the end result makes movie prints from the eighties well compared. <br /> <br /> But, as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a movie without the sci-fi corner and a more simple biographical approach might be better suited to cover the life story of this remarkable lady. There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost the right information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some kind of extrapolation via software-based intelligent agents, somehow looking ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Also, the theme that the movie that a computer device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things over time (eg, the winds) is now known to be not the case. <br /> <br /> OK, so the Victorian kept this view possible. But GÃ¶del's 20th-century works have shown that no mathematical system can be complete. Turing's work on the boundaries of computability, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, completely undermined these ideas. It seems the modern researcher's software is supposed to work. <br /> <br /> Finally, the click of the mouse in the air, which means "programming," is also just wrong, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie might have been ok, but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film a much needed credit in the promises. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the movie, like "Pi", it is clearly a unique job but also many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy, 3/10 of me.
