Author / director Bart Sibrel bases his work here on a can of film that he wrongly sent to him by NASA. He says it shows that astronauts dropped the television recording of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks. The astronauts were in a low Earth orbit all the time, and ground editors compiled these raw footage in just a few seconds of finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so busy realizing that he isn't really taking his "Backstage" material out of the 30-minute live broadcast (also on that line) by millions. seen, not hidden in NASA cellars as it implies. And we have to wonder why Sibrel is playing his own conspiracy about the space of astronauts in the footage. Because the astronauts hear in their own words, it becomes clear that the astronauts are only testing the camera, but not the images. <br /> Finally, anyone can see the raw material for themselves without buying Sibrel's hacked version. (He shows you more about the Zapruder movie of JFK's murder than of his "smoking weapon.") Sibrel thinks he's the only one to see it. What is more revealing is the cuts from the raw imagery that Sibrel chose not to use, such as those who clearly clear the distant Earth that is obscured by the window frames, she demands that measurements and transparencies be placed in the spacecraft windows. creates the illusion of a distant Earth. <br /> <br /> As with most movies of this type, Sibrel relies on innuendo, inexperienced assumption, misleading commentary, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer to accept a conclusion for which there is no real evidence. .
