I am Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries of what I have ever seen. You can see that the people are not clueless. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim they are Puerto Rican, because they are from Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not there. You can see while talking that they contradict themselves. If you want to see a real, and I mean a real, real documentary from Puerto Rico, then you should see "Mi Puerto Rico". It's a serious, true documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was about Puerto Ricans. They kept repeating, I didn't know. Well, it's about the only thing they've done on this so-called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of garbage that is done with the name of the island. It sets the standards down.
