Someone can probably make a big documentary version of the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version only succeeds in immersing anything that is authentic and interesting from the rubbish TV phenomenon. There are dozens of famous bad movies (eg "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this arid, unnecessary waste of the movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not get a documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, which would start answering some of the right questions such as: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the Cincinatti Mayor find himself here? <br /> <br /> One good line: During an orientation session for guests: "People, I can't emphasize enough: NO WEAPONE!"
