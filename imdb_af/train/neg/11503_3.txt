Quentin Crisp once said that when things are shown beautifully, one is a romantic one. When things appear unbearably grim, they are realistic. And if something gets the ironic treatment, they're on the point. Unfortunately, he falls to Leon de Aranoa in the second category. This director apparently tried too hard to make a Spanish Ken Loach-type film, without relieving the comedy and the warmth of the characters, which elevated Loach movies to simply be "depressed." Los Lunes al Sol, is just that, just depressed. Things are unrealistically grim. The characters' ultimate moments of misery all peak at the same point, and if the glamor story isn't enough, Aranoa flushes the story with a visually gray and dirty color palette. The movies were ridiculously overlooked at the Goyas. A movie showing empathy for the weaker in society, in this case unemployed gardeners, does not automatically make a good movie, although I will be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This movie just drives me to make me unimportant in their destiny. In the 21st century of Spain, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and public transport ferries have decent toilets. It is difficult to get a bar with so few points and so little luck. Of course, Leon de Aranoa has no idea about the working class Spain, and it doesn't make any favorites. Pretention is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch a soccer match for free is copied directly from a movie that is much more 'realistic' about the subject of 'poverty' fall, namely 'Purely Belter', which is much more engaging, humorous, yet sad.
