As a spiritual and non-Christian. I thought I'd really take my faith, but what a load I see. I thought the movie would have great arguments, but had only one-sided views of Atheists and Jews ??? And who are all those street people he maintains who doesn't know the back of their arm. Where are the proper theologians and priests and things he can have arguments for. Non-retired nuts who wrote books and completed their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and my time is not worth checking out whether the facts are right or wrong, or whether or not to believe because an anti-Christ told me so. Please think he came with the conclusion not to find God because his own ego and demons got the better of him. No, I'm not going to say the movie was astonishing to help atheists read it, better about themselves. But if you really want to give the world what you care about, poor souls who believe in Jesus are worthy of you, not your beats.
