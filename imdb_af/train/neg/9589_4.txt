This movie is terrible when you look at it. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen. Everyone has no clear connection with the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan, and I appreciate musical a lot. Finally, Bowie had been in the movie for ten minutes and the songs and dance series were sparse and left something to be desired. The morale of the story was really satisfying. I couldn't say whether it was in the 1950s about racial issues in London or not to be sold out. For the first half of the movie, I struggled about how cute it was, but I kept the campsite of the no-selling message. When blacks started to be murdered, I thought my band was kinking. Maybe I hired half of two different movies? No, there was a "Keep Britain White" song and dance sequence. I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write about. At least not a musical that could possibly be described as 'camp', as I have had several times in this review. Overall I want to say this movie can do much better when it comes to mind and throws better actors. (And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit!) My degree: C-
