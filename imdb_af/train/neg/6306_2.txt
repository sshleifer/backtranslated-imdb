When I work at a video store, I see quite a few movies and I sometimes try to watch the not-so-big movies. Pride has become one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a predominantly black crew ship during World War II had some merit. But in less than 10 minutes to watch the movie, you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in World War II. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploitation in the war. This primary point is hammered to the point of being over the whole movie. I commend the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardship they endured. A movie had to be made focusing on the achievements of these men for themselves, the Navy and their country and not making a film, focusing on racism during World War II.
