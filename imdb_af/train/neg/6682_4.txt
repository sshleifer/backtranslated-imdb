This comedy is really not funny. It's a romance that plays so much on stereotypes, it doesn't make any difference. It's a caper movie that is so distracted - yes, even again - it has no snap. <br /> <br /> The throw is sufficient. More than that is hard to say. However, it's nice that the players are unknown. At MGM it would have killed Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman without time for anything other than work could have been a number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known movie is posted by artists who are mostly unknown today. And the production values ​​are not terrible. Yet it does not make a real impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic knockoff. And who wants this?
