(aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) <br /> <br /> Many naked babies thrown into this one with a few lesbo screens. The film is supposed to be in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic. <br /> <br /> This weekend, Gothic lesbians are invited to a count's island castle. One by one they seem to lack their heads due to a crazy man running around. <br /> <br /> It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights, even if candles are lit. Go figure ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by Euro-horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Fairly boring 2 out of 10
