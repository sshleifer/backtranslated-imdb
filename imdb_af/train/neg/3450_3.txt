Someone here compared this movie in some ways to High Noon. Now it's a real piece! I'm a big Sinatra fan including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who played this part was Don Knotts. First of all, as someone pointed out, Sinatra just didn't build a Western bad old wannabe. He is just too small at this stage in his life. Perhaps he was about the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a nice, solid construction. Sinatra comes across as the big talk that nobody should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is uninspired and really not credible. I don't want to spoil it, but I think the end and how the villagers react in this story doesn't make sense. Another thing, these people allow them to be completely by a bad man. It's just a small town, so I don't get the attraction, nor do I understand why people have dominated themselves. <br /> <br /> There is a 'love interest' in the story and if I did, she was upset when the main character refused to recognize who he was so another bad guy didn't want to kill him . Now there is true love for you. "Get up for yourself! Tell him your name so he'll kill you!" LOL Stop, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the movie is not good enough and doesn't matter how they tried this story, it doesn't have a logical way to follow it in the trash bin. Want to know why it is not on video and never be shown on TV? 1956 and it was right - this movie is pretty bad, I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone as much as possible to the sixth part of the case. <br /> <br /> You want a good Western look. A village rising up against a bad man? Try tension at Table Rock, or at Gunpoint - two really good Westerners with that theme Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko, Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you didn't a movie audience.
