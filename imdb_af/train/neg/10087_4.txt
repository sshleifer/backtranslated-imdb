This is probably the first entry in the "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat" detective series; In the subsequent O'Leary films, he was played by many younger actors than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of family members (all played by well-known character actors) gather in an old house (on a rainy night of course!) to talk to a wealthy family member who goes into a coma. <br /> <br /> While waiting for him to recover, all kinds of mysterious action, including a few murders, happens. <br /> <br /> a Greek movie; worth seeing!
