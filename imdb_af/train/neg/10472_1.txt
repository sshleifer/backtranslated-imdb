I had to know I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words cannot be described, and they also do not understand how terrible this movie is. But please let me try to describe it: Terrible dramatic, terrible dialogue, wreath situations, and you get the feeling that you have the beliefs and propaganda of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a bad attempt to try and show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep, religious message. They failed failed. It was clearly the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
