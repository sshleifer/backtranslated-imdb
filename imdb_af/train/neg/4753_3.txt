Director F.W. Murnau got nailed to the silent movie medium he knew so well to cover this story of the indigenous island life in the Southern Sea. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The provinces are beautiful, and the daily lives of the islanders are interesting to watch. However, the film loses momentum when it begins to focus more on the storytelling of two doomed lovers. The storyline never gets that interesting, even though Murnau is well handled. Has won an Oscar for Best Film, although the award has probably been for the best scenery. You can't really get the DP to shoot in such a beautiful place.
