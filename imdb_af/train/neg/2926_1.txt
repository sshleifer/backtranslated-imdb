There seems to be a curse out there at the gay theater. On behalf of, happy ends are not very common. Excluding beautiful things, gay movies tend to end in broken relationships or untimely deaths. And some, like Come Undone, just end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this horrible piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot, direction and timelines. Within the first ten minutes of this film I found myself a little confused, and even more after the first glance at Jeremie Elkaim's character with a little soul session. This movie seems to be randomly merged without the slightest effort of continuity or consistency. There is no right way to tell when you look at the present or some sort of ethereal jump. I could just take as much before it really became unattractive. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden of The New York Times calls this movie "... beautifully beautiful and completely real." Well, it looks like Stephen has invested in beer glasses before it's looked, because it's really far from beautiful. Because of all the praise this movie received, I expected something worthy of watching. Unfortunately, the film has lived to its title. And by the end of the film (which has not given any resolution, I can add it) it is clear that the authors, the director and the film are all undone.
