Full drives. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical, poisonous culture of a decade ago. In this movie, pedestrian regret for slavery goes hand in hand with colonialist sub-texts (the annoying red-headed Shaka rice?). Also, forget about the historical reality. Didn't most Western slaves come from West Africa? An American slave who easily traps Shaka with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could no longer be unpleasant. One can only think, how would he go into the miniseries? (Probably it's probably put). The miniseries were wonderful, and it is a pity that DH had to get his hands on something unique and made it normal. (I tend to think he had the hand to create this fiasco).
