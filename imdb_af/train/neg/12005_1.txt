We've all seen some eternal emails in our time, but this one is really best for everyone! The movie is so long and so slow that it is just putting things in perspective, I felt much older when I left the movie room, than I entered it. For nearly 4 hours it can be made in a tele-series. <br /> <br /> What starts out as a promising comedy is slowly losing its pace. Nikhil Advani woven the plot around 6 love stories and he can't fix one of them. There is no interconnection between them, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to join the story. <br /> <br /> Primanka doesn't realize she really has to play her. <br /> <br /> The situation is exacerbated by dull dialogues (most of them are repeated in the Hindi theater over the years) and silly cinematography. <br /> <br /> Rather than just glam on the screen ... An Outer Waste of Beauty Without Acting Skills. <br /> <br /> And then there's aloof-humorous Govinda and my-face-twist-better-than-you-carrey Akshay Khanna who stays at the top of their lungs to annoy all the tired viewers. <br /> <br /> Only good part in the movie is John & Vidya's love story and beautiful acting / comedy by sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these two couples could justify the movie without messing with a lot of characters. Their luster is lost in the middle of other sublime plot lines. <br /> <br /> My guess - Director was making two separate movies (maybe more!) And some novice assistants mixed all the records, out of a point of sorting out, so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie. <br /> <br /> Just look to test your patience !!!
