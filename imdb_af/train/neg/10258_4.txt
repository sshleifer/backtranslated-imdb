The Earth is destined to be no longer, thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since been used to appearing by his producers who told him many of the big actors) was Pergado Pergado and got his usual, serious and terrible routine. The role play is not bad, although most now retire to act. The movie has horrible sound effects (mainly created by pressing keys on an old computer), and it is ridiculous to think sometimes - a scene of the air, for example, for what feels like hours at a time. In spite of this, the story is pretty humorous in a world-like way and the production is adequate. Interestingly, Albert Band and wife Jackie have a scene; Meda Band; Author Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's Assistant Bennah Burton. In spite of his plowing nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked out and liked it so much.
