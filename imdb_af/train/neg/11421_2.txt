I'll probably get a lot of flack to hate this movie hole. I didn't approach it with the proper lazy eyes of the generation before me. But it's enough to say-St Elmo's Fire was rather slim-freaking-tastic, even as far as Brat Pack movies go. <br /> <br /> Here is another beautiful example of the alley, self-sufficient neurosis that is all 80s (RENT, ANYONE). The plot is virtually non-existent and the philosophies are at its best kitchy, the rest of the time was poorly delivered. The total lack of anything that looks like sympathetic characters doesn't help the situation. There was really no growth, no forward movement. Even the climate-killing scene has been effectively nullified by refusing to enter into death or something like reality or adult life. <br /> <br /> Every cookie cut figure simply goes over to make you hate in the most predictable way possible. The Stalker is a creep for no distinctive reason other than he is a Stalker and Andie MacDowell is beautiful. The Jackass does everything in its power to remind you, he is a jackass. The Gorgeous Slut hides many soulful, deep pain with a wild lifestyle. The poet bends and kicks for a full 3/4 of the film until he can reveal (!) He is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows. The Virgin eventually becomes a very happy person after getting each virgin's desire for one warm role in the jacket with a Jackass before he really changes her (for the right time). The Cheating Bastard cheats until it's time he is caught. And finally, the Feminist pours out holy water on any soul exercising a commitment. <br /> <br /> What brings me to my final meat - what bond of super cement do these people hold as friends? I can't imagine being with just one of them. Now think of the whirlpool created by all the narcissism that is centered in one bar. And they were all so terrible to each other - heads in toilets, near rape, and sleeping with everrrryone. The cherry was after two BFFs acted like the total baboons, after screwing the Feminist. She is like, "Umm, I really don't want to be with you anymore. Let's be friends! And we can hang in a totally uncomfortable way. Day to know that somehow I'm with one or the other. can join, but none of you is enough for commitment (NOT THIS WORD!). "And they all smile as if they have to say," Give it, I never thought about it! What a great idea! " <br /> <br /> That's just not. Kinda in the way this movie is watched is not.
