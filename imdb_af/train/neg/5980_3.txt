There is a group of Fox TV drivers sitting around a boardroom table wondering which new show to do commission. <br /> <br /> "What about something like 24 or The West Wing?" says one of them, but everyone agrees that it will be too expensive, and cheap TV is less likely to harm the station than it flops. <br /> <br /> "Well, how are some comedy writers coming together and doing a quality sitcom?" offers another and is fired on the spot. "Don't you know good writers have cost a lot of money!" barking the big head. "That's why our reality has found TV." <br /> <br /> "We can do another crime drama ..." suggests a man in a mere suit. "I listen ..." the boss replied, suddenly interested. "People love CSI, so let's do another copy of it," adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> "But there are too many CSI clones out there, what can we do to stick out?" a naive junior investigates and is dismissed immediately. 'Stand out! If we do, people can be confused! Let's give them more of what they already love! "The big captain shouts. <br /> <br /> "Let's just add more violence and make it really creepy, we're Fox," another suit says for a hearty reply from "now you get it" from the big head. "We can make them the Deviant Crimes Unit," he adds, clearly on a role. <br /> <br /> "By Jove, he's got it!" the big head laughs, "and the victims can be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on the screen." "Well, that will definitely divert people from the average acting and poor scripts," says Blandman. <br /> <br /> "Then it's settled, we just need a name," the big head says. "We can call it Six Cops Violence?" <br /> <br /> "Too literally, how about Killer Instinct ?? it carries violence, but sounds like a basic institution that had a lot of sex. ' <br /> <br /> 'Pure bug', the major main responses and then they all hit the back and go and keep Arrested Development.
