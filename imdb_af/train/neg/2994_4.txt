I've seen this movie twice now, and I have to say I've enjoyed it both times. It's faster and fun, but eventually brave. It said it had to be earned because of the start of what could be a good follow-up to the original. It is clear to those who have seen the horrible 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films can be blamed for Bruno Mattei, and that the little one who is commendable about it can be due to Fulci. This is not an incomplete Fulci sycophancy, the director's styles are strongly contrasted, and you can know who has corrected it, especially in Matthew's case. <br /> <br /> The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (strangely referred to as a top secret by a scientist, this mystery seems to be more noticeable than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind somewhere Southeast Asia The virus causes zombie like behavior in those affected, and the virus spreads rapidly over an apparently arbitrary area of ​​land, our protagonists unconsciously wander in the danger zone, and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be halfway between a zombie gore flick and an out-of-action adventure, and this confusion is most obviously captured by the zombies themselves, and they do not appear to be a set of attributes. is common to all, some of the regular, wildly fluctuating variety, so well rendered in the original, and probably Fulci's creation here The other main group consists of those who are infected with the virus, have all sense losing oneself, but inciting a cruel aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: ceaselessly jumping to be uncertain whether they should survive their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brothers who look like a massacre celebration on their unfortunate victims. Skills skills are also not their only talent, they are well known in guerrilla tactics, hiding on beams and under hay bales, and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere, but the heavens themselves. This is definitely the work of Mattei. <br /> <br /> There's a third, more chic, variety of zombie. This type also seems to retain an irony. "I'm very thirsty ... FOR YOUR BLOOD". The ludicrous turn at the end of which the DJ becomes a zombie, but continues to talk about the fate of mankind, only serves to improve the WTF factor and eradicate any hope of serious resolution. <br /> <br /> Then there is the notorious zombie head moving slowly through the air, a wild-like skeleton grin that is working over his face, as if to say "yes we know how bad it looks". <br /> <br /> The characters are all quite one dimensional as you would expect. But this is the pseudo comic dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their fate seriously. It said the first soldier died, placing an impressive brave performance against an unstoppable zombie threat. Indeed, this is the first and perhaps just the time our real zombie agro, and one of the only effective scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> The main scientist has heart but no talent, using pauses. In his lines completely random, so he ends up like a confused asthma. The scientists' attempts to find an antidote are totally unconvincing. "Now we can combine these two molecules!" <br /> <br /> There are a few moments that really stand out. In an early scene, a female protagonist investigates an abandoned garage. At the inside of a room we are confronted with a sparse view of a shift figure in the corner and a tear mass on the floor, all shot in an atmospheric diffuse light. The silence is interrupted by the emergence of a speedy gun-rifle zombie that throws everything in its wake in his disturbing despair to have her. His mere aggression is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The hotel 's front and back theme, which hosts the events of the earliest stages of the outbreak, and later as a refuge to our protagonists, is full of a thick, humid atmosphere. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers gently approaches a tidy room that clearly houses hordes of the dead, and it is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they make themselves unaware of what is hiding in the hotel. But it is carelessly handled and not as effective as it could have been. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say this movie may only be deserved to be called a royal screw of a potentially effective tropical zombie festival, rather than just a door-to-door movie. If nothing else, it has much of the unintentional laugh that I expected from almost anything Italian and gory from the eighties.
