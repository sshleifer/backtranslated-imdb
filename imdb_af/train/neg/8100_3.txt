Bonfires of the Vanities is a movie in the flop of sweat. I can't have failed a movie that has been so hard to be so obscene, challenging, and important, but so consistent across the jobs. It's like an exciting comic strip that doesn't laugh, but can't leave the stage. The harder the film tries, the harder each attempt at a laugh leads to a sounding dead. The desperation that the film shows is so scary that it is almost unfortunate for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The movie only reaches a laugh-out loud status twice. Once, Geraldo Rivera is an unpleasant, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist who is just funny because he doesn't realize he's not playing himself. The other scene to be laughed at is the final "big moment" of the film in which the judge Morgan Freeman played, the sacred lecture on what morality is ("that's what your mother taught you!"). The pumping moment of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, one must admit that this is a noble effort. It did have a good, as well cast, band of actors, trying to make characters from cardboard thin caricatures. The film looks professional and the small film flourishing that director Brian DePalma only loves is clear, if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wants to comment on modern morality and ethics, never comes up above the level of cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce needs energy. Even sitcom requires timing. But the best Bonfires can be missing. In the end you don't want to laugh, you just want to turn away.
