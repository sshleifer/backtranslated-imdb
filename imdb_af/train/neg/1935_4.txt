Chinese Spirit Story III is a completely redundant sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The movie delivers the spelling-decisive special effects one can expect, but painful on all the other fronts. The actors all play extremely stupid caricatures. You still need to be in diapers to find their slapstick humor even extremely funny. The plot is predictable, and development is sometimes volatile and often slow. At the end, the movie begins like an old Godzilla movie, including a bad, bigger life than special effects and a (well, still) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have smiled if I expected a camp. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see what rubbish fantasy fans should watch - in this case, because someone thought they could put a little extra money out of a little. successful formula. They won't be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.
