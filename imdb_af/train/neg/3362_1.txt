The Haunting is another bad horror recognition with silly exaggerated special effects and a big screen movie favorite and has no reasoning whatsoever except perhaps for the cinematography.Yes remakes are not bad, but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont are definitely. I suppose A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) divert us from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible efforts to scare it. However, it is a movie that is not a tabloid. do not care who cares in us about the characters and tells two things that this movie has missed. The storyline is like using the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and maturing four chapters and then using whatever the movie is, it is so boring and much of it is inexplicable. The characters are pretty thin and while the play is good, you don't really care about any of the characters. Lily Taylor gives a horrible show and sounds like she's 8 years old when she delivers her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is. Lily Taylor was not made at all for the horror genre. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghosts and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat man dressed as the grim Halloween halter with a smoking machine. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it is not even funny unconsciously just as sad. The house is beautiful and well designed which is probably the only positive thing about this movie, looks nice, but it doesn't save it from its brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV, without price so I would have been even more pi $$ ed when I paid to see it, but fortunately it was on Scream Channel .Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.
