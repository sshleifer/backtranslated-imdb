I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and thought it would be nice to see places I know in a movie. I really knew going in that I wouldn't get the inside jokes, so I wasn't surprised when I sat in the headlights with the deer. What I was amazed at was the ant-non-Mormon action taken in this movie. <br /> <br /> I know this is a Mormon movie dedicated to members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who are not of their faith . Every non-Mormon, who wasn't drunk, drank, smoked and had a wonderful selfish attitude, why? <br /> <br /> It really made me think of this movie, they made the Mormons so pure, but the rest of the Utah state thinks I'm full of punkpsigos just because they aren't the Scriptures of the LDS Church does not follow. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the plots are all around the members of the LDS, but you'll think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which isn't even close to the truth. And as I said, the non-Mormons were portrayed in the movie as drunk, please! <br /> <br /> I don't think I just get it because I don't belong to their faith and I think I never want it.
