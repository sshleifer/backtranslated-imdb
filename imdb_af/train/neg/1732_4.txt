Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and it's really so, so I'm happy to see any of their movies. Basically, a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack, and Ollie breaks with all the horn sounds. He's at home with Stan at his home, needs quiet and the doctor (James Finlayson) calls to say he's coming over to look at Ollie. After the plumbing and electricity was realized, it was obscured by a cross-eye repair, the doctor came for an investigation, and ordered it to drink goat's milk and hurt the sea at sea. After Stan plays a trumpet, hangs the window at the telephone cable and a car accident, he and Ollie go to a dock to hire a boat. They hold the boat on the harbor to milk a goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the newspaper's cover read that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) escaped and sneaked on the boy's boat as they slept, chewing the buck through the boat and drifting out to sea. In the morning they see their place, and the killer comes out to eat something, and he mocks Stan and Ollie who are researching food, eg. rope for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs, and he forces them to eat it. If Ollie starts choking something, Stan trumpets to help, and Ollie's rage lets him hit the killer and stay there until police come. Just to get Ollie's anger, they also get the jail. There were the smallest moments of comedy, but it's not a big black and white movie. "Well, here's another nice mess you got me!" was number 60 on 100 years, 100 quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on the comedian's comedian. Okay!
