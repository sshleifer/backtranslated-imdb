Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their talks are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned college student judging the entire community, based on limited contact with a small number of members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focus is on a small group of individuals portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As usual, the most screaming people are the most media attention. In addition to the misrepresentation of the community in which the film is based, the documentary is well-made. My only dispute is that the feelings and uprisings portrayed in the film are attributed to the whole community rather than the few individuals who expressed them. Of course, it is important to investigate a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences between political views, but it is ridiculous to involve a whole community of people in the actions of some radicals.
