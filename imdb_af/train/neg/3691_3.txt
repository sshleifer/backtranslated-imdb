I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a big disappointment. Between a terrible storyline, the action and songs were only mediocre. The storyline becomes very preachy. Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost appeared as Tamil Nadu's next big guru. My wife tells me that since this movie came out Rajni swore to do more movies! <br /> <br /> We were happy to buy Babu (a guy at Sivajiganeshan) online accidentally online when I tried to buy this one. .... it was a good movie made for buying this dud ... except it looks baby, worse, compares! <br /> <br /> Bryan
