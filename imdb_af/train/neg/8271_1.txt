"Handsome Guys With Bad Haircuts !!" "Beautiful girls without any clues!" "Stupid Gangsters Who Can't Shoot Straight!" From the Dragon Dynasty, the Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat." For reasons that are likely to be completely obscured forever, the production and the casting call for this "criminals-on-steroid" movie somehow reported both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn as villains. But they don't get much to do in this terrible slug feast. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own CV and a list of achievements, and Biehn in particular had the courage to take some challenging and non-heroic roles . <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was the super-bad "Mai" in "Live Free Or Diet Hard", so Nuff said. /> <br /> Of course, Biehn is known to be the soldier who made the 1984 Terminator such a credible science fiction / fantasy skirt by defeating Big Arnold. now the governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost completely wasted in this terrible train wreck of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for this, as the incredibly complicated plot - given mainly in Chinese, as it is a Hong Kong story - can be better worked out for non-Chinese audiences with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn was used as an Interpol observer or co-ordinator or a deeper cover agent, who should give him five or ten minutes, it would have been good. But no, he was brought in as part of a strange group of special forces - kind of bad guys who free their own corrupt deal, in the middle of someone else's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt transactions. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said it all. Confused ? Me too. "Welcome to the party, mate." <br /> <br /> In the wonderful Hong Kong crime drama, known as its English title as Breaking News, there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad guys against good policemen. In this miserable and excessive violent decline in the world of a Hong Kong triad, or gang, it seems that the police force is not much more than a few ducks in a shooting gallery, as the criminals cut them off. br /> <br /> So, not surprisingly, there is an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene (several screens, in fact), where children try to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes. And so, the good shot, governor police officers, obviously intervenes for them, so the arcade owner must give the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also a half-hearted effort to create a love interest "between one of the" visiting policemen "and the only female visiting policeman. <br /> <br /> The visiting police are supposed to be substantial witnesses against the Triad gangster leader being hijacked on his way to his hijacking, court appearance, but not by his own team, but by mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q, and others). everyone has something, but we can't learn what it is until the end of the movie !! It was a stupid mistake in the overall story. <br /> <br /> build a crime drama without getting or getting or getting away, very early in the story. /> <br /> Add a few cut-away scenes for pure artsy effects. showing everyone the bad guys and the usual bad guys' recent past, and any movie buff can easily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from here the fan of all film films with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
