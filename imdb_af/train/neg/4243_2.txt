The funniest scene of this movie is probably when our rescuers get their medals and plaques and what not. So the basic idea is that the police exceed the gang members by as much as one million, but they are powerless because the rogues of the villains are just a little bigger. I think police ammunition is just a little bit of. They decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They talk as they were armed with rolled up newspapers. Well, I admit it's probably still dangerous to be in the fire, even if the situation is so much to your advantage, but don't go. And why did it take 44 minutes to fix everything anyway? I will say this is a very long time when you have surrounded them and you may shoot. They're like ten feet away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they will buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. And then yes, there you have, one of the police actually beats someone. Bullet is probably distracted by a lamppos or something. I had a good laugh, I think.
