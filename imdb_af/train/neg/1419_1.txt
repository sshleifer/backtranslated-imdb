It's a terribly small movie - and unfortunately the company that made this short has made several others. The short is essentially a one-grapid idea that wasn't funny to start with and can also offend you. It has made me very uncomfortable to look at very young children (most were about 2 years old) and pretended to be adults - in this case a dance hall girl and bar room. This is the kind of humor you might have to be forced out of your own children if they pretended to be adults, but I don't see anyone wanting to see it - especially if a very young Shirley temple is dressed in a rather slender outfit and act like a vamp! And then other children like adults act in some rather mature situations. I was sure at the time that they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles, but if we see it today, it is immediately in mind! As a result, this boring movie also clipped ME and I hope to never see it again !! Pretty strange and pretty awful.
