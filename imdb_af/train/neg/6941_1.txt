This movie is not only boring, it is also very badly done. The graphics are so bad they are not even second time - they are terrible. The characters show no facial expressions, the voice-maker is empty and without any soul, and the plot is absolutely missing .... well ... anything and everything. My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
