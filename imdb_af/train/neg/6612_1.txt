I downloaded this movie yesterday through a webpage. The quality was good! I watched the movie with high expectations (although I knew it was a flop), especially since movie superstar Amitabh Bachchan has the role of a villain. Although at least I had actress like him, he had a little bit of trouble doing their roles. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to impress as a villain. It has proven that no one can compete with AMJAD KHAN's magical Rgv trial to justify the past! Sholay, the old one, is a milestone in the Indian theater with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that is still a hit with current generations. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTE was wasted and his performance was average. Raj Raj, a newcomer does not know what is happening. Nisha Kothari has proven she is one of the worst actresses we have. I do not know how she is still in HSRC crew. Urmila & Abhishek saw in a song without excitement and passion. Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen's work was good, I somehow kept her working in this movie It was a total massacre of the original Sholay
