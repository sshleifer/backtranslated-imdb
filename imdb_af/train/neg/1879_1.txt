It's hard to believe it's a successor to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies. While Henry Fool is refreshing, greasy, comic, Fay Grim is slow, boring and does not go. Where's the white gone? I'm surprised. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. It's no fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or big (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame lies entirely on the plot, the dialogue, and even the filming (low budget is no excuse). A great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry I couldn't pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you enjoyed this one, you might not enjoy Henry Fool so much ... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the characters' personalities ... it's all a fraud to lure Henry Fool's fans to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm switching it off now - Henry in a kind of Taliban prison?!?
