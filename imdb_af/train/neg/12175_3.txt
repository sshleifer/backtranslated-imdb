Why should you watch good movies when reviewing "Trancers II"? <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is so good. I can only see the film and crew around L.A. with a camcorder drive, move extras into a dull monster make-up by poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The stars' families are actually starting to play, probably because Full Moon couldn't afford "real" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so complicated that it will take to decompose all the buttons - it must be classic trancers! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... it rules. Note, this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV." I say this because it is true. What can knock to see how an old guy breaks down in a ditch coat, then quit with quips like: "Don't worry about ladies, they're biodegradable"? Well, many things can be better, but anyway, it's still good things. <br /> <br /> My only significant discussion is Megan Ward, who really bumps the face. She is a common contender for Helen Hunt's character - they are both young pieces of eye candy, and it would be more effective if they actually contrast a little more. Oh yes, you can't have everything. At least, the wonderful plot device of the "long second watch" is back in place, and we have more of Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in the history of the theater. (Oh, wait a moment - he has a competitor in the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it recently, but I want to remember that Martine Beswick ran away twice in the last battle. Hurray for turbulent continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine movie.
