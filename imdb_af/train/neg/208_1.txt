Scary movie with pieces of Ramones swollen. Your worse than the average 1970's / 80's cool children's comedy format takes the school over with some erratic plans. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl enjoying the Ramones and bowing a school to fight their oppressive administration. Forget about this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible dramatic, terrible writing, horrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed money soon, so they said yes to this movie. This is the only logical thing I can think of, because this movie is blowing.
