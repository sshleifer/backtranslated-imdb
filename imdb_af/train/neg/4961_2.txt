And that's about everything it is. This thing is slow. The actors have the ability, they just don't seem to be motivated to express the effort. The plot is not that big and is further hampered by the aforementioned inertia of it all. The accent, when there is any, is British. Uh, many of these people are supposed to be dancing. OK, OK, accent is not that important. But language is. I don't think they use words like "yes" and "OK" in Beowulf's day. And that so-called cool weapon that his king had given him? Did he reload that thing? Did he ever see it? Or was Beowulf just as bad a goal? Well, its purpose at least corresponds to the computer graphics used to generate the samples. It was also quite down. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Just one I can think of. Marina Sirtis has risen well over the years.
