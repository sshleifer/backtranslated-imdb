A movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword. I saw myself in my time, but after seeing the unfortunate mess, I don't think I can ever watch another movie again. May God be sorry for the souls who made it. <br /> <br /> Premise-Ex-Army quiet stud, underwear model type character (well done actually) is looking for the girl who sent him an Xmas card while serving in the army. . Countries with her cabin-living-granola-type family that are right-wing loggers. Family takes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time to see he is a better catch than her liberal watch, French wine drinking, porsche driving, loud cellphone talking, lazy, city slip, Jewish fiancee. <Br /> <br /> The bad-1d characters, 1d themes. To be beaten with the Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> The Good Commercial Break was long. Peter Jason. It ended.
