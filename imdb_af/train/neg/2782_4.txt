I saw the movie this past weekend, I'm upset and disappointed with it. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially those of the former Soviet Union, come to this country, everyone they can bring with them from the old country, invade and take over what Americans have been working on. It's a very wrong way to look at immigration, and a much worse way to tell people about it. This is the most important thing. Another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is at the level of village hammers. The actors did pretty well, but it was not up to them to save this bunch of shit. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. Can't wait to get out of the theater, my money wants back.
