I would admit that I didn't give this movie much of a chance. I decided early that it just wasn't my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it has an excellent appearance in terms of its cinematography. The scenes of the early 70's Manhattan look very good, like the main actress. It's very sharp black and white, which almost feels undated and fresh. But some of the other techniques used by the filmmakers shoot out the prospect of hell. The exaggerated editing is VERY late-60s, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. The story also feels that it has come from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and art experimentation. <br /> <br /> The film follows a young girl around the city as she looks at a man who has his anonymous phone. sex with. As she meets other strange characters, she reveals her traits and reveals them. The movie looks like it's an out-of-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel. I would expect that if you liked Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover the phonebook. <br /> <br /> Some problems I had: At the end of the movie, one character tells a rattling anecdote that lasts twelve minutes ?? - brutal to go through. There is also a very explicit animation sequence that I found gross and youthful to serve as the movie's climax. I laughed aloud four or five times, and I like the end (minus the elusive disgusting animation). And when the movie switched to color for the final phone-on-the-night drive, I actually liked it even better. It eventually became one of those experiences where I felt I could really have had it a little different. But that's what the filmmakers gave us. It is obscure, art and away from the shoulder, but none of the reasons is to recommend it on their own. I didn't find it unique or creative as much as forced and pretentious.
