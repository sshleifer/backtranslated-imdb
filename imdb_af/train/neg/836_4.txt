A devoted fan for the TLK movies, with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel that Disney made, comes this movie ... Now I'm not scared with animation, voice, music, but it is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Although it's not bad, it doesn't add anything. Actually, this movie is one big joke ... and it's all about saving it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
