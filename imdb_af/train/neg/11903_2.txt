Wenders were wonderful with Million $ Hotel. I don't know how he came to this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation to spt11 and the view of the American Society is hopeful, it makes it two out of ten. But it's not a movie. This is the best thing anyone can do with a good idea (the west-eastern collision) There are important things in the Middle East and it is only on the screen of a MAC * issued with the fingers of an American girl which is actually at the level of stupidity (because she is just ignorant of the facts). The characters are not well formed. And the most important thing is the idea given to religion, somehow funny to me. In the final scene, Lana says, we can only be quiet and try to listen. And the background music says, "I'll pray." The thing is not about religion. But it ends with this. How are you going to see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray. The lights are already shining on the truth. It's just that nobody wants to see. This. ps: "My house is not a place. It's people." The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence. But it is wasted behind this film making. (Incidentally, like "somebody" mentioned below, America's best young man is not the best, they are just the "poor" and the "hopeless" people reporting for the army that needs good pay, not by the government!)
