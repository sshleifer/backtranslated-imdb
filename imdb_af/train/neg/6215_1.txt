It was really a waste of time ... the movie has a bad plot, the story is fragmented and suddenly ends with lots of loopholes. Although the animation is also. <br /> <br /> After the movie started, I tried to give the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might be interesting later, but it was never unique. The same plot was played over and over, but it made it worse that the big plot hole was the whole story of how to kill the bad things. The writer could have done so much more with the whole concept, but he or she didn't seem to have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> Overall, too much hype, but not able to deliver.
