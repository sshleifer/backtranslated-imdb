The only reason this movie is a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a plot thinner than depression era coal soup, horrific action and special effects that seem to have come from the Thunderbirds TV series, it's amazing that Widmark didn't kill the director to place this black mark on his CV. Even by 1950's standards, the special effects are horrific, except for some submarine subsea rows. I can only assume that it has been nominated for the best special effects because, except for 20,000 leagues Under the Sea and THEM !, there was no one else who did bonds. It was definitely no match for Disney that year if it was their only competition. I would not recommend the movie, even for hard core submarine movie buffs, as the most realistic submarine scene is limited to one shot where sea water can be seen, dribbling the excited periscope. There are other, much better, sub-films that you can enjoy from this era, such as the aforementioned 20,000 leagues or Torpedo Run.
