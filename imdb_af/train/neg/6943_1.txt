This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants revenge for a crime - but if he accepts his revenge - there is always a video camera showing him right. Which man with a brain in his head would sit there and do so in front of a video camera for so long? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script can never happen, except with someone who can't dress themselves, destroys it to me - but it has become more stupid! <br /> <br /> I think the writers have some serious habits that cook their brain cells and make them miss plot holes you can manage a battalion armored tanks. by. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes wrong, and then the unexpected unfolds. <br /> <br /> If only those people who wrote this story were not as stupid as writing totally unrealistic plot twists that could never have happened. For the writers I say-seeking help for your serious spiritual problem.
