A light shadow of a great musical, this movie suffers from the fact that director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the music, unnecessarily "opens up" and pushes the scene apart. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a work in a B'way musical and exploring their drive and desire to work in this demanding and non-always-rewarding line of work. Attenborough gives us a point of view of hopeful people, assuming they are trying to get their "big break" in the show business, rather than creating the more agile mix of characters on stage than a group of working "gypsies" - shows to show along with some newcomers. The movie has one advantage over the play and it is the opening scene that shows the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, which is kept silent from the line the movie). Anyone who can record a local opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly developed movie.
