There is no possible reason why I was the reason why this movie was ever made. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to ease one horrible upgrade from a classic to another? (Cases: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - Awful!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, who I normally enjoy, was so miserable in this role. His manic depiction of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so unspeakably unpleasant to be almost criminal. His ranting, groaning, grimacing and histrionics give us no reason to care for his character, except as a one-dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director should have thought that fast-moving, screaming dialogue and one-task Slapstick were similar to comedy, apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they were red ants in their pants <br /> <br /> Error should be with the irresponsible script. I think the author uses "This is a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world" as an example of a fine comedy. manic like 1963 is classic, it is much better than this slap step. In fact, it suddenly looks very good in comparison. <br /> <br /> What is most sad about this movie is that it seems to be written to a call on young children, I'm just not sure whose children have made it, surely no self-respecting, card-bearing child I know! why didn't they add the timeless charm of the original classics? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot for its readers in "zero" factor, it is the only rating that comes to mind to describe this travesty. <br /> <br /> One good thing came from this movie, the actors and crew were paid - I think.
