I really tried to keep this movie. It is about a major problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story we learn that you can lose everything if you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, because we endanger non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) his marriage, work and even his life. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are terrible; mainly the acting. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very poor taste and you may think you are watching a homemade movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot isn't just sense. How can such a smart and beautiful woman stand out all the nasty things of the man? How could she believe him? The trio situation is priceless and will stop you for a while. <br /> <br /> The scene at the black movie clerk is also useless and makes you think "wtf?" <br /> <br /> Screens like those you'll find. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please, avoid it; It's not a soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. This is a pretentious effort by a so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Kinski's legs are worth the scene. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life won't come back.
