It's probably the worst version of the play I've seen - several times on stage, apart from the movie. <br /> <br /> A very good idea for the essay - the US South can provide a credible backdrop to the extreme. reaction round hero's alleged misdemeanor. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widowhood is a very temperate Beatrice that delivers a particularly poor performance. Good actor Waterston is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The worst performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature like the villain who connects the girl to the railroad track fits into the keystone head capers of Dogberry and his men - but the acting allows you to ring. <br /> <br /> Successful set-ups include the scene where they deceive Benedict to believe that Beatrice loves him. If the acting is competent, it will be wonderful. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict moving closer is well-produced. Overall, I had to force myself to look, but it certainly did not keep my attention. <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Regarding the latter comment above, I'm almost 40. I've been watching Shakespeare stage and screen productions for over two decades. May I suggest when trying to defend your friends, but rather than talking to other reviewers when armed so insufficiently. However, I can assume your ease with the youth that you have enough age where the fashionable behavior of passing days is more to your liking. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite couple was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic artist can act.
