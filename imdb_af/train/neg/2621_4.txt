I will not bring a child under 8 to see it. With dolls deviating from buildings that close through dangerous machines and are laughed at Cruella's scary to name a few of the events, there is far too much tension for a small child. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more ominous feeling than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disturbing moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, many tense moments that will worry and small can scare. children. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the Disney people think, but not the story or the acting was their usual level. The puppies are cute, but this movie is spotty at its best.
