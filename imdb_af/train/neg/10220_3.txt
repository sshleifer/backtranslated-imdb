First, this movie can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambush of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the completely miscarried Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison. Miss. Bergen spit out four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she's just walked out of a 1970's Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she keeps zero interest, with zero credibility. The third and final section involves the completely free slaughter of an Indian town. It is so exaggerated to rely on the anti-war propaganda, which comes across as long, shameful, and confronted. Not recommended. - Note ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why not look at the movie you are commenting on instead of refreshing your liberal nonsense. It's not a political site, it's to review movies. - NOTE
