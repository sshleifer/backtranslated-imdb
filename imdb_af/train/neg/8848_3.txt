Somewhere, buried deep in this movie is a half-way decent movie trying to get out. The only tracks are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a cemetery) and then a few pieces of production design. As I say, buried very deeply. One of the biggest challenges that movie becomes supernatural is how to respond to credible characters in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's response to the fact that his sister (was supposedly Dee Wallace of the first movie) was (was?) A werewolf, if I remember, in the sense of; "Oh, really?" None of the better responses to this challenge. The non sequitiers continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba's (seemingly self-appointed) "Queen of the Werewolves". As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yeah, even better than the werewolf group sex scene, Reb Brown's play, and the peculiar simian look weather wave packs. The end credits have received little legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censorship finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie is about the same amount of sentence. When you pick it up on American television, the credits were reassigned to replace Danning's endless repeated shot by opening her top with another endless repeated shot of her rip, a mantle just this time she has a little top down. It's a kind of absurdity, cherry-on-top moment that ignores satire.
