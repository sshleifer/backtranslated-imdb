Overall, I found that if you didn't hear of a movie before seeing it on DVD, it's probably a good reason for that. I didn't hear about this movie until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies have already been hired (those I wanted to see anyway), I thought I'd shoot this one. <br /> <br /> It's really no different from other movies in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or the RM If you're into those types of movies, you'll probably enjoy it. <br /> <br /> But if you're not a Mormon, this movie probably won't appeal to you. There is no way to prevent the exaggerated religious (Mormon) message, and sometimes it is so juicy and cheesy. Eventually, if you do not fall into the demographic demographics, you are probably better off looking at something else. <br /> <br /> There were some very funny moments in the movie, but I didn't think it was enough to save the movie overall.
