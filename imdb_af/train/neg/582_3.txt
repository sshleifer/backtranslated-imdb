Brilliant book with wonderful characterization and insight into human nature, especially the nature of addiction, which is still strongly resonating today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circle and circle and surround, making the viewer nauseous. Why the director didn't stop it is outside of me - but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow, to make good performances of these normally excellent but improper role players. All in all, a poor adjustment. Your three hours will be better spent reading or reading the book.
