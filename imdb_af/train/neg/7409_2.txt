There are some elements that save this movie from a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed by bad plays, plotgate, deus ex machina cast, silly dialogues, poor writing and predictable clichés. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black man who first gets it (yes, the cliché still seems to be alive, even in Finland), seems difficult to leave a mysterious empty hospital. There are screaming ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought they didn't at least use zombies, but they came), and Finnish glamrock band with demonic make-up, to get in their way. There are also some time shifting doodles present, but it doesn't add anything to the storyline. Autistic girl and oboe look a little more understanding of a situation, but they never play it out for the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound lessons of thought such as: "What will happen ..." or "Light cannot live in darkness ..." or the ominous "I need a red crayon ... red chalk. " So all these characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in emergency times) end up doing their dark floors around and from or accidentally to the demons. Sometimes a ghost or a group of zombies appears, and if a devil keyboard player does not see a group of six, with a flashlight and a conversation, it just pretends. And this devil apparently breaks through the walls without much effort, but the opening of the elevator is beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end we even get a "it was all a dream" turnaround. Or maybe it wasn't. Oh, boy, I wish this movie was, and the kind of time making it look faster to move so it all plays in just 10 minutes.
