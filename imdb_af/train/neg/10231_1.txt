Honestly, I was rather surprised that, based on the brilliant reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I wasted almost two hours on his debut offering. Were they all written by his friends? The action sounds alike, the music is annoying and over use, the writing is simply dire and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) are mediocre at all times. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but say that it is brilliant if it will not be, will only encourage him to make the same mistakes, namely to continue writing his own scripts and using the same actors for another business. Yes, it's his first movie, low budget, etc. I get it, but it's also for members of the public to buy and it's just not too tight.
