This film has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who regard it as one of the worst movies ever made. True, most of the films based on the works of the King are pretty bad, but this one goes beyond bad in the kingdom of the terrible. There is not one scary moment in it, unless you consider folly. It is typically King Waste - upset myths have nothing in common, mixed with obvious and slanderous so-called "scares" that are as shocking as PeeWee's Playhouse (which is at least entertaining). It's full of ridiculous moments, not least of what Alice Krige's character is. When she starts on a rampage and starts slipping like a villain in an old Batman television program, it's so absurd to be sick. All the people who came in this (including John Landis) are happy that they still have careers. But the most absurd part should be the cat costumes, which look like cheap rubber outfits that someone at K-mart bought. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually work out the people in the movie.
