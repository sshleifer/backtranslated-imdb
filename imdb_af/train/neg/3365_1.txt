These poor remakes of the 1963 classic start out pretty well, then replace tensions with tangled and useless special effects. For example, in the original one of the coldest moments occurs when Nell and Theo lie next to each other in two beds, and in the frighten the sounds outside their room. Nell told Theo to let her go because she hurt her. Nell then looked at Theo, who was several feet away and realized it wasn't Theo with her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying in bed alone when she suddenly dives and slides over the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen power to stop pulling her that we realize what happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's final words mean - "It's about family. It always happened about family"? <br /> <br /> The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even that can't save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones once again shows that there is underneath her beautiful outside depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. However, Zeta-Jones should spell it out, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one to be sent to the useless remakes cemetery.
