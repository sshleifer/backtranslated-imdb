The film begins with promise, but lies too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We keep on hanging, but with nothing but cowardly shots of serious and thoughtful male faces to enjoy. Certainly no queue to help the wall climb us. It is a pity, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We wonder how a loving couple - a father and son no less - should become so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable. when claustrophobic imagines past everyone. Rather, this loss of presence in the real world is too clear and unnecessary, unlike the boy who has armed in the armed forces. Why not the circus, so we can at least appreciate any color? We're having a kneeling sense of loss, but unfortunately, no relief, which is staggering with the movie, is apparently about a form of achievement that is not available to all of us.
