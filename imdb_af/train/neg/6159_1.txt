Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it's their responsibility to tell us whether they are screens or not? That point is totally unimportant to any argument that must be made against this entire dog of a movie. <br /> <br /> I think sports movies fall into two categories; well-made movies about the human spirit and competitions, and `By the sword '. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie can never decide what it wanted, a touch drama to try your best in life, a charge of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick. In the end, it did not convincingly or completely enough to give me one ounce of care. <br /> <br /> For the record I'm also a fence instructor (and now I'm officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fence in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically. I mean look at Star Wars (episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fence). I like those movies. But if you make bad sports in a bad movie, people think it's just the purists trying to find it. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comment on the smaller issue of fencing. . It's just a bad movie. In the end, this movie has nothing for the screen enthusiast or the movie cache or just someone with a wrist and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie and are forced to think, `Man, I wish I had watched the Mighty Ducks. "I know it's time to circumvent the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is someone in the lobby who will somehow give me back two hours of my life.
