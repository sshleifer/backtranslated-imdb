Generally, I like horror movies, but unfortunately it fell out of one pound bargain in my friend's hand. We sat down to see it, ready to be scared and eventually sprayed food everywhere we laughed so much. The concept is not that bad, but why they decide number ten in the series, it will be happy, I do not know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was poor, the special effects were actually not bad if I was generous, but the story couldn't connect at any level, because the actors were as effective as a small bunch of badly charred elm. They were out of bounds, especially a brave young actor who was too young for 15 years to act seriously as any kind of government agent. He looked more like a public schoolboy. There was a very amusing sex scene where he looked like he was chasing apples, like a bustling lady riding on top of him and later his napping underwear was hysterical, but then I remembered it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. I struggle desperately to find something positive about this movie, apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but there is simply no. Let's hope ten are the lucky number and they don't do one, I don't know my ribs can take it.
