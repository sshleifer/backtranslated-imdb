This movie is a farce! Names are pronounced and the plot is twisted and broken in something not recognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / crossbow weapon. Beowulf doesn't need such a weapon! In the poem he ripens Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can't believe the writing writers did such a thing. The way Grendel is portrayed, however, is impressive. This and the cast is the only positive feature of the feature. My English teacher would be insane if she saw this abomination. Unless you're the hard-working fan of the epic poem "Beowulf," avoid this movie at all costs. And even then I wouldn't recommend it.
