The 1960s was a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheaval and unrest were common when people expressed their views. Racial tension, politics, the Vietnam war, sexual debauchery and drug use were all part of the daily substance and daily news. This film has attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects in an entertaining movie and has largely succeeded. <br /> <br /> In this movie two families are followed: one white one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each of the sexes simultaneously through social and family laws. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. There are more characters in this family, and the story lines are mixed, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century. <br /> <br /> Generally, the acting is well done and historically Footage is mixed with color and black and white original material to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the timeline. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie, but the situations were predictable and the story was one-sided.
