OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Other than that, I'm Spanish, I eat Paella and I like black humor. Well, with the point set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea how pleasant the Japanese audiences are, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director - despite the excessive pedantic postmodern things in style from Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting - and it surprised me that he got it. It may just be one of the lost cases, but I'm afraid it is, but if a European viewer overloads the movie with subtextual English subtitles, I just thought it was terrible. The jokes were bad, the writing was overcooked. I mean, give the audience a break and keep a little damn narrator. To the point of causing my head to explode over a remnant of quick talk and absurd action. br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is wonderful, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. But the eye candy ends as soon as the characters are set aside to start with an endless, not funny, all-mumbo jumbo speech on still photographs. It just makes you want to move forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters. <br /> <br /> I'm reading Mamoru Oshii is actually planning for a sequel to this. The idea was good, but terribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will record the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-told scenes. But, if you thought Talking Head was thin, Amazing Lifes or Fast Food Gifters will cause you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all these comments are based on the experience of someone who is European. Probably, it is completely useless for Japanese people, perhaps it was a very funny movie lost in cultural boundaries and translation. Can be.
