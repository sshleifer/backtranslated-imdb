2 stars out of a possible 10 - and it is excessively generous. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas. miss it. I went wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was at the weekend, he cut out this dribble. I suspected Sam S. long that he was kind of nuts. This movie, based on his play, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of artsy b. those actors like to sink their teeth because it gives them the opportunity to endlessly endure. However, for the viewer sitting through this awkward trash, there is absolutely nothing to love this movie. <br /> <br /> You didn't see dysfunctional families until you saw this bush. Dad is crazy, Mom is crazy, the boy is crazy and the girl is, yeah, crazy. They also have mouths on them that give words that will blush a sailor, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if it wasn't enough, the plot - and it's so thin you can read it thoroughly - it has a hole in the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> Mom is teaming up to sell their dry farm. As it turns out, Dad is. Now I do not demand to be an estate agent, but the last time I checked in, jointly owned property must have both owners' signatures to be sold. If only one of them owns the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be senseless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore she does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else really works. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason why anyone can watch this movie, they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can't imagine why anyone wants it.
