There were only two things that interest me in this movie: I waited for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> It was basically a one-week show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to give candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this movie. Like Jones, he had nothing at all. The film was already Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who really had part in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one and he saved himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I don't know which director Jan de Bont was. He did a good job with Speed ​​and Twister. He really fell here on the job. Perhaps he is still recovering from the disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He had to thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise it would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
