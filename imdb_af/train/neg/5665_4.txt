This deliberately bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, undone by the terrifying half-baked play of most of the role-play. The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel's Mexican era, and sometimes looks like a poor man's act of Lars Von Trier's elements of crime. Cox's apparent preference for single tests, jumping cuts and ambient sounds keeps all work against the film's effectiveness. A look, but ultimately disappointing.
