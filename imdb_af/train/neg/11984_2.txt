Ugh! Another of the "fools of the cover" DVDs. I expected some kind of action, at least with bears, cats, and so on in front. I have nothing! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to think it through completely by thinking that it would eventually happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now that's why I gave it a 2. is because of the scenery; otherwise it sucked. <br /> <br /> The child was horrible, talking to himself (although I suspect they could not just make a movie with stupid music and no dialogue), his lame karate stood at a tree stump, which threatens a raccoon, strikes worms and (kicks a dumbass) kicks a swine. And he won't pull those demons out so easily. They also like fishing hooks. At least he fought the bear a few times. <br /> <br /> What happened to the jump-back? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival film, not a dramatic bs about a child suffering from divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they had to eat the bear or have the child. At least it would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People don't waste your time on this one.
