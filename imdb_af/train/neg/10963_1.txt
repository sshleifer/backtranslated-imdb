I went to see it in the hope of some good old-fashioned Alice Entertainment. When I realized I wouldn't get it, I watched it for a nicely made movie (in terms of filming, and yes it was). But apart from the fact that he had a good movie quality, as I watched grainy movies all day long, there was nothing good about that movie. <br /> <br /> He killed 42. Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, who can answer this for me? Who can answer me something nasty about this movie. <br /> <br /> I agree with whoever said it was just one big long joke for the staff. It's all fun to be. <br /> <br /> Arms Mr.Carroll. I'm so sorry someone did this with his wonderful stories.
