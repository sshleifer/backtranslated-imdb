The fact that I watched this whole movie says something about it ... or I. It's not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in the perverse way, which is similar to a tragedy and not to look away. It would have made a wonderful MST3K box! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a horrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, confronted plot sequence, ridiculous pseudoscience. You will boast slo-mo death sequences, the poor-mouthed agape victims and waaaaaaaay too much time to consider their impending punishment, against the outrageously savvy savior of their deaths. Your heart will be heated by old action-acting clicks, such as when two women struggle for a gun and it goes down, but who is being shot? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one finally ends. You will sing along with the street carolars (in Latin of course) who become a terrible death chorus, who threatened to turn the film into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you believe I'm doing it, as movies get worse, they get better, then it's a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current sci-fi slide favorite, "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's fun to watch as luke warm movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
