Jack London's life was definitely colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him. Unfortunately, to say that after which his life was used in film, some wartime propaganda was the best sight on some of the least attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, barely 40 years old. when he died, some of the best stories were written about it. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote what everyone was bringing with him his luggage. From that experience in another day and time, racism would have been condemned. But it was World War II and London was a great believer in the 'yellow danger' as it returned in the day. <br /> <br /> Two thirds of the film covers his life as a writer, we see his years as a sailor from where he got the inspiration for The Sea Wolf. We saw him in the Yukon in a mining cabin with a dog that was undoubtedly his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to find the spirit of adventure on which its own life was all on paper, so that the world could have enjoyed it ever since. <br /> <br /> The final third has its time as a war correspondent on the Russian-Japanese War. London was a socialist, but its socialism did not include people who were eastern. Like a few million others, he saw rising Chinese and Japanese immigration to our Pacific coast as a threat to work for white people. He introduced strict immigration policies for Orientals. <br /> <br /> The movie puts the cart in front of the horse. London is being presented as a man who has been to the Russian-Japanese War that was Japan's ambitions and therefore he was as xenophobic as he was. In fact, the type of atrocities that were present in World War II did not exist during the Russian-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but so did everyone to the USA. But our immigration policy, caused by pressure from our West Coast politicians, was a major contributor to the weakening of relations with Japan over a few generations. London was part of the cause of a prophet not crying in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later made films with a little more budget than Jack London. He got a little more money, Bronston, maybe James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of whom would be right for the role. Instead, they have Michael O'Shea, who made his second movie to Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is good in the part, but definitely not a box. <br /> <br /> If London covers the war, he meets a Captain Tanaka played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specialized in Orientals and played a ton of them in World War II. Starting in 1905 Strong sketches in the best Fu Manchu tradition Japan's imperial goal is ultimately to pick up the US. Must have been good with the swing shift crowd. <br /> <br /> Of course, London's life, including a first woman, is omitted. The second and only woman in this movie plays Susan Hayward, who first comes into the movie when it's halfway. I wish we'd seen more of her. Charming Kittredge London died her husband almost 40 years in 1955. <br /> <br /> In fact, O'Shea met and married the leading lady of his life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they have been married for 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we'll have a look at Jack London which will be much better than this one.
