Where to start? It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The editing was the worst ever, the sound effects were terrible and the sound editing was broken. Most of the movies that everyone can be here are the crazy kicking effects, with a spoken talk in the background. I had to change my volume on full blast just for her going on .... and what should I hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can't believe that people are actually putting some green for this movie. It makes me think I can take a shit in a box, send it to producers, and then they can finance me a movie. <br /> <br /> Dolph was a regular Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. The villains were bad, the lead players were bad, and the movie was a stinker. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, directing or editing a movie, watch it!
