I can't believe they managed to spend $ 17m on this movie. Spectacularly bad acting, real-life scripts and effects you can do on your average computer, incredible plot contracts ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced flight attendant a great job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this movie is so impeccable that you feel as if they are trying to take you with a crucifix over their heads. All this film will do, will preach to the choir and make everyone laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this movie really wanted to turn people into Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have used the money to really help people in need. Now, some people would have thrown in to actually listen to them.
