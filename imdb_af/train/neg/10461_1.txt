Interesting to read comments by viewers regarding Omega code. Much of the overwhelmingly positive comment has been almost word for word from TBN broadcasts. The film seems to have been made to go directly to the video, except for the three-parting series done in the 70's by another religious group. don't remember? You will remember this one in a year or two. This is the first movie I have ever seen where it implies that it was your religious duty to go there and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... it just shows that if you are " a televangelist's son, you can also play a high-roll Hollywood producer with lil ole ladies 10th money ...
