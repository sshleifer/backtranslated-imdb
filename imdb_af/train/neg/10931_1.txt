I went to see this movie with fairly low expectations, and it would be a nice piece of cloth. Unfortunately it wasn't even that. I could barely sit through the film without going out. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even asked, "How much longer?" After lasting to the end, I just wonder who would approve this script. Even the trusty Fred Willard couldn't save the trite dialogue, the jokes and the banal plot. I would suggest that anyone who wrote and arranged this movie (I use the term loosely) should take an online screen writing class or write to their local film college class. At least, there are many books on directing, writing magazines and producing movies that teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.
