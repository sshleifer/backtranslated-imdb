To die (1989) was just another death. feature that appeared on cable ad nos during the early nineties. The only thing remarkable about this feature was Duane Jones' latest film. Other than that, there is no reason to watch this vampire flip unless you are surprising like pseudo-chicks like a horror movie. A tired vampire longs for love and seeks the back streets of L.A. to look for it. Will he succeed or will Vlad just strike out like he did for the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie had to be big because some persecutors soon followed. They are so bad that they look like this one like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires, but the filmmakers got used to lighting. <br /> <br /> Not recommended by me, because I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
