I love low budget independent movies and have great hope for this one. But this movie is static. Remember the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the pacing is deadly. Admittedly, these people reach a lot with little, but the film fails at the most fundamental level. It's boring. The editing is glacier and the pacing stalls. It had to be 65 minutes. The best thing about the Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, which is not nearly seen. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we must suffer from Baltimore-British tribes through endless and tiring exposition. It feels like a dramatic backtracker that is placed on video. <br /> <br /> Noble efforts by everyone in the production, but a story that needs this, needs a kick in the pants, and the new low budget technology had to make it fresh. voice. Instead, it's just a lame correction.
