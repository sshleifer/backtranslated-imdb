Blank Check is a movie I saw one day on TV and like most movies they air on the empty check, it wasn't that good. First, nobody I ever met saw White Check, and it included people who grew up in the 90s. Also, Blank Check will not be remembered in the 00's, simply because it will be overshadowed by Pixar's films. I won't call blue. Check out a bad movie but it's not really entertaining either. (Or at least it's not for anyone over the age of 6). Blank Check is not an entertaining movie because nothing is original. Everything just makes you go "what haven't I seen before?" Blank Check rip off and try cash on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone. (Strangely enough, both have Macaulay Culkin in it.) Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves anesthesia.
