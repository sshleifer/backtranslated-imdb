The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, dual role Robert Englund, free sex and nudity, murder and murder. On paper Tobe Hopper's nightmare sounds as if it should be at least a fun, entertaining movie with the ingredients. . It's not. It's a plot less, incoherent shambles that bring little entertainment. There is basically no plot above some vague things about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who, for some unclear reason, has the need to deceive and kill the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist. It's pretty much it-I think it has something to do with the Gnostics, but who knows what the authors think. Most of the movie is a winding debris, as the heroine is exposed to various strangers, dream series and erotic encounters, with the scenes of Englund as the prisoner De Sade in the 19th century. The creators seem to have been trying for something serious, but whatever their predictions were, they were buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleazy and fake looking stunned heads. <br /> <br /> There are not too many good points. Robert Englund is nice to watch, as always and main actress Zoe Trilling, though not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of climbing through the movie, but watching Night Terrors is a task. At least I saw the movie from which the "If you're so criminal if I" come from the Australian film certification rating guide that came in front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties.
