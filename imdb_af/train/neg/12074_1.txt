Ridiculous horror movie about a rich man (John Carradine) dies and leaves everything to his four children, and his servants are evenly divided. One condition - they have to spend one week in his estate to get the money. And if any of them die, the other gets more. Guess what happens next. <br /> <br /> I saw a brand new print of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and lively and the house looked beautiful. It's about all the good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Let's name just a few of the problems this movie has: the killer is screaming obvious; The servants are known as Igor and Elga - come on! some of the sound recordings were so bad that I couldn't make the dialogue (no big loss I'm sure); The gore was sparse and very poorly done; The other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains a real horrible play. You're just as bad in unbelief on the screen. Even before Jeff Morrow was horrible! The only pretty good acting was from Trouper Faith Domergue (who is better off than that) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and weakened here). I have to admit - the closing line in this movie is a gem! <br /> <br /> Why it's called "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there's another 1978 horror movie with that name! <br /> <br /> Whatever its name, it's a bad movie. To be avoided at all costs.
