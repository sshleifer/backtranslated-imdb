This film is a calculated effort to make cash into the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the movie falls between two stools and cannot rise. The characters are unlikely to have a clear dialogue, but never act remotely as a human being. An arbitrary, senseless action follows another to progress that passes a plot, and one of the links of the fake of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points to play out her little heart, but executive honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as if it were all, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement? ). Me. Staunton cannot make a false move. We could also say about the writer director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill gets annoyed you, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-cap.
