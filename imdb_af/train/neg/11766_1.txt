It's hard to know where this adjustment is going wrong because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith figured out that you were not reading them for the detective stories, but for his deeply derogatory and totally unpleasant vision of an African that did not exist. He did Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not so successful, but in so much fact. <br /> <br /> Once I realized it, it stopped me from Jill Scott, an American singer / actress, throwing as Mma Ramotswe. If she represents a country that is not Africa, how appropriate is she a black woman who is not Africa? She is not the only American on the role; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far too young for the roles they play and much too glamorous. Both brutal murders on the local accent, and both focus so completely on this brutality that they do not offer much in the way of acting. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is hopeless, cute and soft. Rose's Mma Makutsi is an annoying engine head. <br /> <br /> The result is almost inflexible. The main rejection is only redeemed by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who has a decent performance as Mr. JLB Matekoni accomplished. Hes gets smarter and more intense than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for it - he's a shining light in an ocean of suction. The inconsistencies between his performance and the books are clearly at the foot of which butcher's committee wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing has always been highly entertaining, but rather notorious. He refuses to be edited. Consequently, her books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientist and characters changing the name of the middle of the sentence. So it's something of a performance that made the writing team on this project really worse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely Anglicised. Characters speak of "opening up" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni flits openly. Mma Makutsi claims she didn't have a computer, but because she regularly rebuilt her hair, makeup and jewelry, I was surprised she didn't have a MacBook in her handbag with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> So what are we doing here? It is hard to be upset with this crappy adjustment because, honestly, most of the things I like about the original books are at least apocryphal. McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populace with cute, non-threatening black people who are full of amusing and tasteful wisdom nuggets. It reads well in spite of linguistic oppression, but it is a vision how some kind of white people want black people. This is just not true. <br /> <br /> Given this, it's almost surprising that this show is struggling as much as it does. It has yet to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice.
