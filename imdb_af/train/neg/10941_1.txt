WOW, what can I say? I like shity movies and I'm going out of my way to watch a tricky action movie, but Snake Eater, I'd rather have a nail in my pithole while my grandmother gave me a shot. Lorenzo Lamas, pfft more like Lorenzo Lameass this man has as much acting ability as Bill Clinton himself controlled. It has all the goods to make a very bad movie even worse. Crazed Hillbilles YEP! unnecessary tit shot (with a real weird scar) YEP! crappy soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but one is as low as it goes. Seriously, I think someone was joking at me when I saw it, it can't really be ... the worse thing. There are 2 more snooker movies! ...... she recommends in demand.
