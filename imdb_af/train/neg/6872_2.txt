This show has pretty good stories, but bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. It's pretty obvious why this show was canceled, although I, like most UPN shows, never knew it existed until it was syndicated. <br /> <br /> Most of its plots were copied from other programs and movies, which made me think the producers didn't have an original idea in their minds. <br /> <br /> I didn't comment enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect wasn't bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> The goblin was a nice character.
