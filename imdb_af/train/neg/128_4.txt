This film, which is ever sensational to its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has gradually diminished to curiosity. It now seems absurd that this most boring little movie has been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given how socialist Swedes finally became, the "radicalism" of its politics, once controversial, is naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time the subject of sensational obsession trials, seem pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentary information on its many controversies and influences remains essentially observable as an early relic of 60's youth uprising. One part of the movie that still stops: its self-awareness of the 'fourth wall'. The filmmakers make their own film every time. The satirical playfulness of this evokes a bell.
