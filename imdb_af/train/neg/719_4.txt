This film, although apparently a comedy, is deadly serious. The subject is Imperialism (with a chapter I): how Britain, foolish, humiliating, tries to convince him that it is still a great power after World War II. At home, the empire is run by crazy, benevolent Tories who are so excited that they cannot distinguish close relatives; The government offices consist of long-forgotten archives (a count in Orwellian paranoia?), Inhabited by indolent rats and ante rooms where the lounge is boring, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, Britain is holding the old pump; but pump out of context seems thin and stupid, especially when embodied in bumbling twits. Carlton-Browne is an unintentional picture of decline, with nothing of the lachrymose rotting that has spilled the presumably anti-imperial jewel into the crown. <br /> <br /> The movie is also about the Cold War, bravely acknowledging that it is a dangerous farce, whose contestants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. It's about how colonialism, which is more characterized by neglect than tyranny, destroys the colonies that destroy it, robbing them of amenities, power and, more importantly, self-respect, and making them vulnerable to the cattle of dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> That's the seriousness, of course, it kills it. It is not to say that weighty subjects cannot be treated in comedy. The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek, dr. Strangelove and Brian's life proved it all. Indeed, one can imagine that serious themes should only be treated by comedy. This makes it possible to get a clearer eye. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Browne is that every situation has a meaning over the mere comic, so it deviates and becomes unfit. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy comes from character reaction to an extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here is the script too poor to retain rich comic features, and some of the greatest comedy talent ever met are Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier. Crime is being abused. <br /> <br /> Sublime, Terry -Domas often shows that he could not handle leading parts, and that he needed to play snare, arrogant borders, not brainless toffs. The music was made to bear much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only focuses on the lack of hilarity on the screen. (To be honest, unlike most British comedies of the period, who were stubborn and underproduction, the Boultings are trying to make their own points through film itself, by assembly and assembly. Only Huntley succeeds laugh, and that's by setting up a character that he could have played in his sleep. <br /> <br /> None of the Boultings' farces have dated well - they are never thought of enough Although Carlton-Browne flames in the decline of the Empire, it also appears to be anti-democratic and militaristic, and I'm sure it wasn't meant to be, but these blunders will happen if you allow worthy intentions to prevail over comic intelligence and film form.
