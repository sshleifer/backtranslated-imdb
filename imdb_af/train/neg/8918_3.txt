... fortunately he hasn't! It is rugged, simplistic student politics made in drama. It needs the viewer to buy in a series of concerns. Conceit 1: That a British voter could be exchanged from basically right from center to overwhelmingly far left. Conceit 2: That all media debate and the general public ended unanimously and that the only prime minister's only critics are sinister civil servants, MI5, large corporations and Americans (of course). Conceit 3: That this radical socialist PM can solve all union, economic and social problems with complete ease in a way that unites the nation. Conceit 4: It's a good thing to break all ties with the US and NATO. Conceit 5: That the Soviet Union is not a cruel and oppressive regime and that we should be closer to them in the 80s. And finally, Conceit 6: That US reactionary forces would actively seek to launch a coup against Britain. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous and the show just got the reputation it did by trying cash in on some anti-Thatcher feelings in the country and with left-wing TV critics singing its praise. When it was made, television was still an extremely popular and influential medium with performances that get great views, such a wide range of drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience. Ray McInally's performance was wonderful, which is one of the few pluses. History and time have shown the great weakness and plot of this show.
