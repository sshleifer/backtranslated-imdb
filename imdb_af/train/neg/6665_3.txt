OK, the story. A Simpleminded Loony enters a life of bored young chick and her child's brother and destroys them in their lives. It is lightly interesting. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has a few ...) - the performance is everything. <br /> <br /> This bothered me about this movie. And it saved me a lot. The rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the climax expected. We saw five, six, seven times the free highways - why? Norton's character is seen as a childish game, not deep enough to understand his / her problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a wage-maker? References to the "Taxi Driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and certainly not for this movie (or for E.N.). And IMHO, it is fun done at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teenagers somewhere in Mid America. This man had to kill the child, blame the father, create a real destruction. Whether the child had to be killed at the end of the father, but no, we ended the caseus where children miss the loony, the father is amazed at his own life and relationship with them and the loony naturally dies. The happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed, safe and bored, so we can enjoy our popcorn. Undisturbed. <br /> <br /> And that scene where the loony enters the movie, oh my God, I'll have to think long and hard to find something stupid than that! You don't shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. Creators of that movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you are a 16 year old girl somewhere in Kansas, or where and where, where and do you dream to have sex with a crazy guy twice your age, OK, then you can enjoy this movie and his "message" .
