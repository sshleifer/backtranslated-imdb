Somewhere I want to read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. After I saw it, I'd call it. the point of this movie unleashes me. This dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd. Many of the sets were memorials, and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie. Even though I was surprised to just wonder what this thing was about! the title prize could be the basis for a fun (as politically wrong) comedy. Instead, we treat cheap, amateur, unfinished sketches and depravity and strangeness for your own entertainment. If I want it, I'll buy a mercy-jones CD.
