(When will I ever learn?) The ecstatic NPR reviewer made me think that this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Please let me get off my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I will admit that the environment, probably New York City, has never been so ugly and unattractive. I am reminded that the 70's were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all the smoke! If the plan was to cheap the characters, it succeeded. <br /> <br /> For a movie to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there must be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close, and I couldn't wait for him to shut down Nicky. If a stray shot hit Mikey, well, it may have at most a shoulder of indifference. <br /> <br /> I can't remember when I hit a movie so strongly. I think I'm a noise that doesn't dig "art" movie. Oh, well.
