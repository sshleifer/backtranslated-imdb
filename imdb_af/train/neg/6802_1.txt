Words can't describe how bad this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You also have to see how terrible a movie can really be. Not that I recommend you to do it. There are so many clicks, bugs (and all the other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To begin with the technical first, there are quite a few bugs regarding the aircraft. I won't list them here, but just name the color of the plane. They did not even show a plane in the colors of a fictitious airline, but instead used a 747 painting in the original Boeing delivery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times, much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I really lost it early. All the time I was in the movie on the bad guys, because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive Decision" should undoubtedly be your choice on this one, even the "turbulence" movies are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.
