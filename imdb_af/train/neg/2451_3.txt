This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else I've ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, just hire to laugh with your friends. I won't be the millionth person to get his mistakes apart. All I will say is that the movie (for me, anyway) has lost big points to turning my favorite character, Sam, into a stupid idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
