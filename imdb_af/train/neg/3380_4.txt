Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show have been running for years, but evidence of his strength and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation, which is probably due to the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, as far as B-way you could ) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer as a slimy corporate lawyer). The clever story, about a disturbing audition for a Broadway show that becomes a therapeutic session for the actor dancers, is being pushed up straight on us, with tough buyers playing on the beams. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially a laughable subplot about an ex-dancer returning to the theater and stomping heads with old flame Douglas. The overall hopes are filled with promise and sadness, but their personal stories of anxiety are a bit embarrassing; This, in line with Attenborough's sluggish pacing, game disasters, and even the now-known songs fail to break the artificial wrap. * 1/2 of ****
