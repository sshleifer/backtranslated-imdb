First let me prescribe this post saying I'm a fan of the original Star Wars movie. I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the grain (if there is one). I'm simply a fan of the movies. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I struggle to see how people praise this movie. Taking this movie itself and not comparing it to it's horrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how you can say it's an amazing movie. For all the terrible shortcomings in the script - cute dialogue, confronted scenes (ie R2 is suddenly a bad and long CGI-intense chase with little human touch), HORRIBEL acting and noted plot holes. How is this good? ? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; it was just like a switch reversed and he was suddenly suddenly. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which has been destroyed by the "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein scene). If you fill in the screen with the amazing CGI effects BOMBARD and the gaps with absolutely horrible one-liners when more and more could have said, it's NOT a BIG MOVIE. For a movie with such a "dark" tone, there was too much lifetime in the speech of ALL characters. <br /> <br /> I close a question: From the beginning to the end of the movie, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually going to happen?
