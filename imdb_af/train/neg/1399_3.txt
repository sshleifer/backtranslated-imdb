Ouch, what a painful BORG Sci-Fi movie! And this is especially sad because the opening was 15 minutes so actionful and full of potential! During the intro we follow a lot of nerve security officers and hired men, looking for a doctor who escaped from a mysterious lab with a briefcase full of top secret files. While revealing the so-called terrible and inhuman events taking place in the lab, he is being executed. Numbers ?? From then on, the 'action' swings back and forth between two places, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural house of a corrupt senator (or something), and it soon becomes clear that the experiments are actually the opposite of the story. More like sowing, useless and vague. Scientists have chosen four random people without living family members and it is really really important that they speak the truth, although a huge machine reads the contents of their minds anyway. They all hide dark secrets of their past and people suffer when they are revealed; Yet I do not see how these tests can ever lead to a human threat device. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt it. The interactions between patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, since really none of them have personalities. So basically, "the brain machine" only handles a bunch of lambs in a terribly decorated room. The film could also have been shorter half an hour if it wasn't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings! The shifts from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every five seconds from the locations. Either the makers really needed the padding, or they just assumed that all Sci-Fi viewers could not spot morons a place change in themselves. Staring at a abandoned pool with a cottage in the background for the tenth time in just five minutes becomes quite annoying, I assure you. James Best's performance as a respect for spiritual issues is pretty decent, but one man certainly can't save this thing from an absolute waste of time. Avoid!
