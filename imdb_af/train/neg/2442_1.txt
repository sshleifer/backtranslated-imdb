I don't know why I do this to myself !! I defend the Dutch and Belgian theater and claim that it should get more credit and chances ... and then they are hitting you with such a mess! Intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst ever made in the Dutch countries. This is a Dutch effort to create our own horror franchise, which is clearly based on American American classics such as Friday 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers were very good at it, but they were very low. Intensive care has become an embarrassment to everyone involved and therefore there is a true cult. It is almost impossible to hunt an original copy of this and it is only shown on special occasions, such as "The Night of Distaste". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even make a plot line ... then it turns into a cripple and low brain streak a stalk movie with gruesome - but very hilarious and cheapest effects. The performance of the entire cast is horrible, though there are some respected names. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters. This man can also be the best-known and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, host of TV shows and idol of many young girls. He never calls this thing he died. Like everyone in the Netherlands, he tries to convince him that Intensive Care never happened.
