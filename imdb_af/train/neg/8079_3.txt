Another movie with an interesting performance and some amazing special effects that fall right in the trash. <br /> <br /> Better direction and action (with the exception of the beautiful Annabel Schofield who is much better than a brunette and probably earns better material, and the eternal experienced Charlton Heston) deserves the onslaught of a real stinker . <br /> <br /> It is great to see how Heston performs his usual performance and how bad this movie is. He even plays in a sub-plot that just interests me to see how it tied back into the movie's main line. The way they finally decided was that they didn't. It simply falls from the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Don't waste your time on this one.
