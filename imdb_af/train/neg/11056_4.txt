I was so disappointed in this movie. I don't know much about the true story, so I was eager to see it play on film and teach me a little bit of history. With such a powerful real story and great actors it seemed to be a surefire combination. Well, somewhere the script failed. It was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to incorporate all of the stuff into a good story, but this movie wasn't. I was cold to see characters that were unlikely because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. Other small grips: 1. The heavy-handed soundtrack. It's the seventies - we already get it! 2. If he is such a phenomenal speaker, why aren't we here and there treated like a slip - and even then mostly in montages?
