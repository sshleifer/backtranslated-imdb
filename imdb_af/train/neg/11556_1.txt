Oh, those Italians! If it is assumed that movies about drowning aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles in Gothic atmosphere, and stubborn relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance, are inherently interesting to everyone! If you've seen one of these movies, you've actually seen them all (the MST3K favorite "Screaming Skull" also fits in the form) ... and "The Night Evelyn comes out of the grave" is by, by -the numbers, and sow like hell. Even the nice Erika Blanc is being wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
