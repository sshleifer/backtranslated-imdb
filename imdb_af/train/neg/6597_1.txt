It's much worse than the horrible Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60's. They were terrible, but they were at least simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie revival. New audiences rediscovered the couple's comedic genius and the cartoons were cheating garbage that was used on children's interest. That was to be expected. But, how do you even try to rationalize this work ... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the creators hoped it would inspire some other Laurel and Hardy revival somehow, but you couldn't inspire interest in the past with a level and careless caricature of what made the original so attractive. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call their actors) do a Vegas act and that is where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to expand two-line ideas. If this movie was someone's first exposure to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer will release the reputation of the original duo, as senility is over. The only movie I hate worse than that is I TEAM ON YOUR GRAVES. And you know, these filmmakers basically did the same with Stan and Ollie.
