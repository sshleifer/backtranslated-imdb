I'm a huge fan of the book and Orwell has been my favorite author since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity, Burton is an actor that I consider highly. When I heard that he was playing O'Brien, I was swung. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer on the DVD. first and a few fears began to set, mostly over the frankly horrible "theme song", the Eurythmics hears mechanically shouting "1984!" over and over to an electronic knock is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The action on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the scary Room 101 -scene. But this is also where the movie is dropped. The film spends too much time on the love affair between Winston and Julia, who honestly did not write about Orwell. He writes about a disturbing future, about how Ingsoc builds one's beliefs and then crushes them all, in the name of whom he is made to love Big Brother. The film is about what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons assesses his position in life and the world and his re-education via O'Brien. <br /> <br /> The comment on IMDb at the moment determines that movie sticks to the book are completely wrong. Julia is not present when visiting Winston O'Brien, they do not commit themselves to Goldstien's Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no clear mention of the initial cases where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons, but it is called near the end. If you haven't read the book, it's completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A horrible script, which can't save some great acting. Michael Radford seems completely missed the point Orwell is making, and the electronic soundtrack is frightfully horrible.
