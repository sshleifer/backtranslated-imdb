I don't want to go here on a ridge, but ..... this is the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than the Avengers. Unauthorized live, intact writing and horrible acting are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without the emotion. The lighting often looks like a single sun gun. The sound is slightly better than a single microphone on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just terrible. The plot heads off in strange directions without foundation or later resolution. The techniques are obviously absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. VAT, the packaging is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
