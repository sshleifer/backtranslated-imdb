The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angles and the cheese activity I fell asleep. I don't think the director and set manager can decide whether it's raining or not, because there will be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I will rate this movie a 1 out of 10 (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game were really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just losing time. I beg everyone reading it not to see it. It's not worth it.
