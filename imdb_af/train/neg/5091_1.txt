My comments are for the Russian version of Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space), which appears in Russia's first channel on April 10-13. Bad translation could have destroyed some details, but I doubt this is the case. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). Even the American half of the movie contains multiple errors and omissions. The audience is not told of any V-2 / A-4 launches from the US. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number "UE" on board. Apollo 1 is launched to the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, every person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is sabotage and traitor, Mishin is alcoholic etc. Men as functions; no motivation, no life. Uniform and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a clumsy song in anticipation of launch (I think it was specially added for Russian version).
