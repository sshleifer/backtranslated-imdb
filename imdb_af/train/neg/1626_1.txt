This movie recently appeared on local TV here in South Africa and I thought I'd even warn those who would like to watch B-grade bad movies (which I do) that it's not even amusing. The plot relates to a couple visiting a home in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film, which was apparently shot in the early seventies, consists of extremely wide shots of people walking in real time and very slowly from A to B. It makes the movie boring in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff never happens. I'm really curious - how many people have seen it from start to finish?
