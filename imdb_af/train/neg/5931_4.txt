This movie only had to be 10 minutes. I mean there is really only 10 minutes worth of content in this thing (I even hesitate to call it a movie). The opening credits of the movie were somehow promising. As the movie begins with short comments from the man himself, you really rub your hands and silence for more images from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen, whose white and well-spoken words all tickled your fiction. But as it turns out, Cave's performance is just the beginning of long super boring performances by literally a lot of people who don't even have a minimal attraction to keep you seated. I mean what does the filmmaker really think? Five-minute after-shots of wanting singers in a fake concert in Australia !!! What does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding "false applause" to these endless nasty performances. The movie is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you have seen. There is not a single footage of Cohen's past. In fact, except for some pictures of his early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you pick up all the minutes Cohen speaks, it won't even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are scarcely suggested by the disastrous camera work that some of the most unattractive people of Cohen's lyrics shout. If you've ever decided to waste your money on this movie, DO NOT! just throw it in the garbage and save your time at least.
