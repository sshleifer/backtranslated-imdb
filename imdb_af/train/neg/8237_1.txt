How, in the name of all that is sacred, has this film ever been distributed? It seems to have been shot on someone's cellphone and take the scenario of the screaming girl victim to the whole new depth. They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters, and not very observing. Shout and shout more. <br /> <br /> After fifteen minutes I gave up and quickly got through it to see if something had happened. That doesn't mean - except for the scream, of course. The fact that it is moving fast is another problem. There is no camera work to talk about. Each shot looks like any other shot - middle distance, one corner, dull, dull, DULL. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, it's good. It's just bad.
