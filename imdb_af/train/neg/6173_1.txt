This movie is a blatant left-side attempt in Hollywood to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and bungling. Some flaws were made at the time of the crisis, but I'm not to the extent depicted in this lame movie. My first response was that this movie had to be by Oliver Stone, but this time I went wrong. There are many others there.
