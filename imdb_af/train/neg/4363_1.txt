It is difficult to find any positive in this movie. Seems like the producer needs to make a buck without much effort and therefore we are treated to a full view of the Galaxy which is the excuse for a movie in history. The police girls look very sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots from the two police and much less Galaxy would have been the way. Of course it will add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that miserable revival. Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy and her acting is first class. Ms Stabs, who I heard from before but was not seen on the screen, also looked very desirable, but does not look like basic acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright, this is real garbage.
