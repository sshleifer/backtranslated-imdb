This movie is birthday, and miss the point. It's far compared to the 89 Batman who's trying to join. That female singer is not her name, and we see why her film-bearer died. Notice how this movie is dead in the box room, no one sees this movie on television. My uncle and dad were expecting Batman, and the movie's impression is more like Cop Rock. Not worth renting 3/10
