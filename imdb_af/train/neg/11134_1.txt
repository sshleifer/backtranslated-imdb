This is a very cheap made werewolf flick. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The screenplay is cliched with the usual characters like the difficult detective shooting weather waves with his silver handgun! [full of silver dots]. The acting is like wood like the characters. The FX is non-existent, very extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and bites. The only thing shown is very soft core T&A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for these trips, watch a very good recent werewolf photo: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
