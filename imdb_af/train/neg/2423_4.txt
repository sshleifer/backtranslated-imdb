I got this movie from a private collector and was very curious about it. It had a 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes) and some external comments were enjoyable. But I have to say that this is a very ordinary and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great filmography, the movie is well-aimed, but it never hurt me. It started out well, but even though it's not bored at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that are so normal that I didn't like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can make a few laughs. And you can see a few tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I want (bizarre, surreal, nonsense, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders ...), you won't appreciate this movie very much. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 for good directing and editing, and the final turn, which makes the movie entertaining. But it can be much better.
