A beautiful boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere, cats and death soon follow them. It sums it up. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I'm a little freaked at cats after watching this movie. But in earnest, despite the many things that are wrong with this movie and believe there is enough to go around, it's generally a very enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basic instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride or anger seem to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that the apparent failure, in fact, is telling the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King script (not that I have anything specific to Mr King) is very well supported by interesting FX work, makeup and great music. The absolute jewel of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige playing Mary Brady, the other world mother. <br /> <br /> King manages a simple story of outsiders, or people who are a little different (okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and turn it into a camp about the top small horror jewel that should be in the collection of any horror fan.
