Oh me. How can they make movies of such beauty, but it's so terribly bad. I mean, even yours Boll doesn't make such a crap. There is not even an indication of a decent story, multiple characters or attraction. It's just a random set of senseless conversations that come together to make a movie. I suppose only children up to 3 years can enjoy, as the world is so completely dimensionless and the story is so incoherent that anyone who gets older will be annoyed. But then it is still too scary for anyone under the age of 6, that there is probably no one who needs to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay far away from this movie. Your little girl can make a better story, and although she may not be able to draw it nicely, her stories are worth a lot more to listen to. And please, in the name of who you believe, do not expose your children to this ****. I give it 2 out of 10, and it's exclusively for the graphics, because the story and character development is so terrible that they earn a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to watch it anyway ... remember I warned you.
