The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during a Sneak preview. It wasn't even premiere. I remember there was someone from the director staff there, don't even remember who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were pretty neutral and didn't know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he stands the mile before the rest. He plays an actor whose star has long ceased to rise. He helps to realize a movie in Belgium entitled "Shades". <br /> <br /> Once the movie has started, we noticed how much curse there is. Nothing against the occasional swear word. However, it was annoying. When Rourke uses the F *** word to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone uses the movie, a non-English speaker uses the F **** or S *** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost how many times they use the F and S words. Everyone was just happy to be outside the theater. And we had to give a voice, but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we watched the -10.
