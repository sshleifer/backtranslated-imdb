I can't believe how someone can make a comedy about an issue like homelessness. Of course, Brooks didn't make a comedy about _real_ homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat that often. Brooks' films have become worse and worse over the years. It's just another nail in the coffin.
