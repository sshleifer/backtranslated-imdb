I was seriously looking forward to seeing this movie because it was really promising of the following attractions: Jim Carrey with divine powers was an idea that definitely worked for me. As a big fan, I was sure he would be in his element with so many promising premises, and what could go wrong? Yesterday my bubble burst into big time, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where it was set up to hate his life, he is a disgruntled employee and a big unfortunate camper with an ax to grind against God) is serviceable, the second act (where he is called God by phone and receives Almighty powers) is BIG - Carrey is having fun with his new 'toys' and it is a pleasure to really watch. But the third act is dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The rotting starts after supper between Bruce and his friend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who got the upper hand in this movie, as she shares only a plot device, even her NAME series of incompatibility) - She thinks he's going to pop the question, but instead he says (bowed down) that he eventually gets his news anchor job and isn't it so exciting? <br /> <br /> She doesn't think so. She wants him to marry her. Look, she's going to leave him. Although she still loves him, see, and the rest of the film is spent beating us over the head with one pathetic, handing spiritual sound to the next, until the end I also prayed. . If it's over. <br /> <br /> I didn't think of the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the second act, after getting his powers, Bruce is looking for the room in the song "What if God is one from us, just a slob like one of us, and I was even willing to ignore the incredible amount of contradictions that we are having (for openers, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce he can do somebody The free will does not violate, but he does it, many.) Those choices were forgiven - this is a Jim Carrey comedy, led by Tom Shadyac - it's not the remnants of the day. <br /> <br /> Or rather it was a comedy, when the writers watch it (in the dreaded act 3) and try to change the proceedings in a kind (gag) Message Movie, that's what we get instead of hell Earth realizes the mistake of his selfish ways, he realizes that grace is his saving - grace, and that his priorities in life are seriously wrong s. However, all of this could be transmitted in a much less heavy-handed way. The movie does not have to go into the dump to make these points. Unfortunately, the authors and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to solve the story in a smart, light way, so they overlooked the route in hope we wouldn't see. They even hit a few surprisingly unpredictable endings, with the further hope that it would reduce the bad taste. It didn't work for me.
