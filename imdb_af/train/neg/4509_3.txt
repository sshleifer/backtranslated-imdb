"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that resembles a camp, dragging queen satire as anything that has to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film also claims that geishas are not prostitutes or concubines, that they are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. But unlike a breathtaking dance, the rest of the movie turns into "Pretty Baby" in Storyville area, or at least Vashti and Ester in the Purim story, as all women's efforts on art and artwork over many, much older , drunk drill men. Perhaps it is a Japanese culture that is being promoted, and not just for American louts after World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the tension to speak English, but Ziyi Zhang barely shows much of the big flare she demonstrated in "House of Flying Daggers (Shi mian mai fu)" and "Hero (Ying xiong) . " Michelle Yeoh sometimes gets a glimpse of her assured performance in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)." Only Li Gong shows any real life. Otherwise, I held Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in the kabuki theater, especially if the plot dragged into cat fights after cat fights. <br /> <br /> The alleged love story has zero chemistry, mostly due to age differences, and I mostly felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped that his Hollywood wage check would be compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious "chairman . " I remember more emotions in "Portrait of Jennie" if the young girl is anxious to grow up in Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see brief views of reality when the rash with regular women as photographic attractions, and as an ageless, Ziyi Zhang lives out of the war years in a very colorful kimono-dying operation. The final has little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The score includes many chopped traditional melodies, with cello by Yo Yo Ma and violin by Yitzhack Pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation, which is beautiful to listen to the wonderful cinematography, as long as one plot completely ignore and edit tightly. <br /> <br /> As my mind goes astray, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai movies would handle this story, which would probably have been Formal, but much more emotional.
