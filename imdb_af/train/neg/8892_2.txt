Must admit, this version scans Shakespeare in advance! No one can act except the nurse who was my fav! Juliet has good skills as a teenager, but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we can never connect with her. She is worse off doing the scene if she is considering drinking the drink. I would have thrown it into her mouth to keep her closed! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Mostly with his other big movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is quite a shock in this one. And don't start me at Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of the movie. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and then current Leo and Clare!
