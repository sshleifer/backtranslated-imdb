This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and it does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but here he is young. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? Because the writing is terrible, the adjustment is terrible and the actors seem bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I can only imagine when it would end and I turned it halfway. The director did a very poor job and although I didn't read the novel, it was definitely a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film is trying to call and the message and storyline never reaches the audience. In one word this is a horrible movie.
