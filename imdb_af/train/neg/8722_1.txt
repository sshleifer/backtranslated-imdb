Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's "Alligator" (1980), which is actually an excellent movie, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" ends the exotic trilogy Sergio Martino around the end of the seventies (including the rather daring "L"). "Isola degli uomini pesce" and not so well "La Montagna del dio cannibale") Awesome plot of "Jaws", the writing fails to create any tension so ever. The being is ridiculous and its victims are simply despicable Stelvio Cipriani's lame tune badly illustrates the adventures of these stupid tourists who are offered from the start as the most obvious items of the reptile's meal, no excitement, rather laughter! And we can make this spicy movie quite funny find that the dialogues and appearance of the natives are not as naturally inspired by pure racism. Very soon the giggling stops in favor of an acidic feeling such a condescending attitude. X's excused, but not that kind of mentality. Never!
