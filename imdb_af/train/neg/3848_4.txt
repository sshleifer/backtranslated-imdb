The film is almost ridiculous with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters working together as the mothers of convicted killers. With the horrible notorious after the trial, the two women team up and leave NY for California to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls. From the beginning, it seems that Reynolds made a mistake to take Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who is increasingly apparently going off her rocker. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the women living together get threatening calls. Reynolds, who wears a blonde wig, is soon praised by the wealthy father of one of her students, played well by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> In one of her last films, Agnes Moorehead is briefly seen as Sister Alma, who winters is a faithful listener of. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is heavy here and hardship made her act even better. Winters has always played well in roles that test her nerves. <br /> <br /> The end of the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano with that totally insane look?
