I don't know what you breathe, but please stop. Macaulay Culkin and Kevin McCallister were lovely, cute, sweet, loving and very nice to watch. He had that innocence, but at the same time he was also strong. <br /> <br /> This new kid, Alex? Annoying like hell! Only a blatant ripoff to adjust Culkin's charm and grace fails. <br /> <br /> The villains make the crap. Harry and Marv, they were such an entertaining screen saver. They were comedies, they were humorous and just made you want to root more for Culkin. That's what a good villain needs to do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely perfect for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who just bicker and again try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not saying they were terrible, but they were not memorable or even really so entertaining. More actually on the walls. <br /> <br /> Then we got the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Unforgettable. Ideal to watch around Christmas and bring a wonderful Christmas feeling and bring out so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story and cares for the characters. Simple, memorable and close to masterpieces. Part 3? Masterpiece of shit. Enough said. <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't know why people like this. I think people really don't know what a good movie is. It is an unfinished coaching with more unrealistic falls and a stupid new main character I wish the robbers would at least knock out of the shit. <br /> <br /> Start running away from this garbage. And can't even start with Part 4!
