Small college town coed OD's? (Why do we care?). Acting sheriff investigates the incident. (Why do we care?) The interviews show us the comatose subject (Kirshner) as different as the views of the topics being maintained. (Why do we care?) Result? A mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie with a handful of one-hit wonders and B-flick divas asking the question ... Why are we giving up?
