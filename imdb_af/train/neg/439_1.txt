Just a finished rip-off of the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it is absolutely incredible that this poorly written rubbish lasted for a full eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this unconditional crap were in their sixties and seventies and just agreed because they had nothing better to do or just remember the star of the old Dick Van Dyke Show . Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, was never much of an actor (by his own admission) and he was too old to play a doctor when the series started in 1993. He looks absolutely antique as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. His talented real son, Barry, a wooden actor who was rarely in anything that didn't involve his dad, plays his son in the series.
