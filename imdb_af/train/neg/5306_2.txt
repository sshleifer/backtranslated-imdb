OK, I'm blessed. I saw two very strong stage productions, one in New York with the original cast, and another at the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to one of these, the film is almost immovable. I've plowed through the DVD for the past two nights and haven't finished yet. Too much excessive dialogue and too many plays and people. Yes, the four big shows are pretty good, especially. Me. Streep's. But comparison of stage to movie is definitely an example of "less is more." The thickening of the play to satisfy filmmakers' need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice. Please, please, find a stage production somewhere near you.
