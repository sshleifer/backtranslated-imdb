This is what I found repeatedly in the remarkable dishonest third act of this sorry excuse for a movie. First, the computer effects are absolutely blowing! The computer wizs really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters work in a realistic way, especially in the aforementioned contemptuous 3rd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). Lots of laughter in the movie comes unintentionally, as when trying to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than this! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. What would you do if you were invisible? No one can catch you! These issues are much more intelligent in the classic The Invisible Man from 1933. There is one particular scene of violence that is so incredibly ambiguous and not mentioned later. If more attention was paid to that, Kevin's mad scientists would have made a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The movie would actually be much more successful than a porn, as the point of departure can actually be done in a unique and interesting way. But this piece of work ... is going to see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
