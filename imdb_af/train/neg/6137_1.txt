Wow. What can be said about Gymkata who has not yet done so? It is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that makes you laugh on the floor, this is the perfect movie to get. From Cabot's game style sweater / sweater combo to Parmistan (and that's four billion different ninjas), all about this film series of crap. Directed by Robert Clouse, the notorious thought that brought you the mirror image. In Bruce Lee's game of death, he again shows his total lack of talent. A few other faces that you probably won't recognize will also appear to delight you, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, though you won't remember or care for them after the movie is done. <br /> <br /> Probably based on a book called "The Terrible Game", which if I could find a single trace of its existence, I would be interested to read it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book seems to be a consequence of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse made up to sell his lame idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this one and Yakmallah for yourself. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and it says quite a bit.
