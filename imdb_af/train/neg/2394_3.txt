This movie was strange ... I watched it as I imported a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was very strange. I'm pretty sure you should see it high, but mushrooms were not enough. I can't stop laughing. Maybe lsd will work. The movie is a lot of things that morph into other things and dance. It's really cheesy for today's standards, but when it was released, it was good ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If you have a party or something, and everyone who is beautiful, print it, you will get some laugh.
