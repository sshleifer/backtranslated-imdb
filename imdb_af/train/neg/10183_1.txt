This is a very serious production. The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret might have been spoiled and pampered and possibly had the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the worst point of the production, the actress didn't. It also turned out that the production budget could not reach a hairdresser. From the beginning, the hairs of Princess Margaret's character looked at a permanent bird nest in disarray and seemed to be dragged through a forest. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh prepared him for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was over. <br /> <br /> The production was a mistake, cleaved, clich√©-ridden, embarrassing garbage. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
