"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy", whatever you want to call ... is simply not the point. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just don't like Gangster comedies (as I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia sucked). It is probably more "spectacularly sharp word game" than everything from Komedy, only she is not as greasy and sharp as it is or the other judges make it out. <br /> <br /> The Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start making a running gag, and was sometimes painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change of place or feeling for the period in which they were supposed to be. The majority of the film was either in Dreyfus's Club or a variety of Offices / Dull Rooms. .. (what was that? Put out the gun, Goldblum stays on the win)? <br /> <br /> The supporting role was ... on paper excellent (good to see Silva and Drago), but characters were previously killed they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors came, was a joke! The Romantic and Love element of the film also put it down. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I don't think I'll be back soon.
