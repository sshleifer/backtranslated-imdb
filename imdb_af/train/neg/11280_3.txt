This movie is about a man's life going wrong. His business failed, and he couldn't fertilize his wife despite several attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is complete chaos. It just doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes sense. The story is so bad I couldn't understand it. This is a pity, because the sets and costumes are well done and are visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed in the movie. However, these redeeming features cannot tell the bad plot and the bad story. I'm amazed at the big names that agreed to die in this movie. It's such a waste of their talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid it!
