Terrifying play, Bad story line, cheese-like makeup, and it's just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life. In 5 minutes I decided to move forward to see if any salvation would happen. It didn't. (Apart from a nice chest shot) The movie was apparently filmed in a furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets. You even see the same red chair in several different places. If you want to make a movie, you should at least rent an office building and apartment, not a warehouse that will accommodate all of your acting dialogue. (Note to producers) Renting a small office space and a month's apartment is much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are more versatile and credible.) If you spend your money to rent these people, I hope that you have a return guarantee ... You will claim your money back ... I just spent $ 2.99 to rent it tonight and I felt ripped off.
