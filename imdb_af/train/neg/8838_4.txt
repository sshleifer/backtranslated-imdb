There are similarities between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his last film "Lantana" ?? a dead body and its consequences for all the dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" left everything unresolved in a dark way that would leave most viewers dissatisfied, perhaps even cheating. <br /> <br /> The story - the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a brief story by Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic 1993 ensemble "Short Cuts". Lawrence uses this theme for exploration and exposition of relationships within a small Australian community of stress. The movie poses a few moral questions: "Do you want to destroy the discovery of a dead body your good weekend?" and more fleshy for Australians "Does it make any difference if the dead person is a native?" The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism that are enhanced by music, not a picnic at hanging rock. <br /> <br /> If it all looks like the base for a wonderful movie, be prepared for an expectation, the pace is very slow and the killing is shown near the start, eliminating the element of mystery. And so we stay with these deserted lives and an empty finale.
