As a fan of science fiction movies, I am aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. I will allow people to tell me about the little thing. I believed it was very original and sophisticated. I'm also dedicated to Alice in Wonderland. I could never really figure out how I missed the Matrix when it was released. With the approaching release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy and watch the DVD. <br /> <br /> The disappointment was too great. The rationale of the matrix (the controlling device as opposed to the film) was clever. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternative realities, is shop turning. However, I could still have bought in the film, as a science fiction, if it remained firmly in that genre. Unfortunately, it has become a standard, "they will or will not escape, break through, need salvation, etc." To make matters worse, it seems to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science fiction and martial arts movies are really two different types. For the purest, the devoted one or the other, the two do not mix. It's like mixing science fiction with romance. You may have one or the other, but not both in the same movie, or at least not the same in the same movie. <br /> <br /> If there were such problems with The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded really made the problems worse. At least thirty minutes of the movie was either martial arts or the long-lasting car hunt. (This observation ignores the question that was made in every professional, negative review of the movie: If Neo can do the Superman thing, why does it stop fighting? The answer is, of course, that the young male demographic group in the theater.) Then there is the "redemption through love" aspect. The plot device was exhausted by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. This was actually better handled by him in Die Gotterdammerung. <br /> <br /> So where does it leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded. Martial artists probably greeted the trite, but arcane sci-fi philosophy. Science fiction fans wondered why they were sitting by a kung-fun party. Most of the men in the audience are probably bored by the silly romantic aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> Just what do you get money for when you see The Franchise Movies of the Matrix: Science fiction, martial art, or soap opera? A bit of each one doesn't make much of any of them, or a satisfying movie for everyone's afficionados.
