A very sleek modern (keep it sensual hip) relive on the Dracula story (although it remains with traditional customs) with quite an interesting, if not fully understood, story of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to look at it, I could only go halfway before I lost interest. Again it starts with a good start (especially the screens with the thieves and then their meetings with Dracula), but then to me it is less when it touches New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A good place to put it, but never used its settings (despite the etching of a paradise in the dam, where Dracula can thrive). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes, they cast the name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artificially, it had its moments with little dreamy visual arts, but helped some kinetic editing and cheap shots. The messy writing becomes very stupid. Lussier does a polished work that stays bright, lots of blood (the make-up is properly achieved) and a very "virgin" advertisement. No, I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it gets in many shots and Helsing's daughter also works there. Oh, it wasn't obvious. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock style. Now the shows are everywhere in the store, but there are few familiar faces to mock (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler and Dracula just didn't come down because not much of a presence was formed. He was only eliminated by the fat ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's Brides. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are pretty good. Christopher Plummer gives a grizzled twist as Van Helsing and Omar Epps has fun with his role.
