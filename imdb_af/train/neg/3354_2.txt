It is my opinion that when you decide to make a very good movie again, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least it gives a fresh stand. Now the 1963 Robert Wise tells of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I shook my head and asked why? The play is wood, the story is unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be replacing the subtle horror of the original with so many special effects that computers can generate. I heard this update was bad; but could not believe it was so bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. Having seen this and telling my wife how terrible it was, she said; "Well, they have your money!" She's right, don't let them get yours. If there is no profit to make awkward recovery, they may stop making them or come to a higher standard that will not offend their audience.
