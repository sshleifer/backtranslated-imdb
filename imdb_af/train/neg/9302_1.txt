This movie is just awful. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen and the scenario is so bad it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he is ugly, overweight and looks like he was from the early 90's. <br /> <br /> All the characters are gone for the weekend to come with friends, but nobody is really friends! The married couple have not seen the "chief" man for more than 5 years and even back they were not really friends. The "date" of the chief only knows him about work and if there is a girl picking them up at a bar. Now tell me you will lose your job spending a week at your cabin with people who aren't even your real friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Don't waste one minute of your time on this lemon. I made home movies scarier than that! <br /> <br />
