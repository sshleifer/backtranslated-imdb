I was fortunate to meet George Pal (and still my DS: TMOB poster written by him) at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the movie "camp". Before he could answer, two studios captured and taught me how the studio knew best and how "no one would take such a film seriously". I have been thanking the Bantam reprints for a few years for a friend (ComiCon 1970s participants will recall Blackhawk and his band? I joined them in a few years) and had more hope than we had has. <br /> <br /> The flacks insisted that no high adventure will ever be done seriously, and so 'camp' is the only way. Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as well as he could. At the end of the event, Pal came to us and apologized for doing more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could easily have been the next big movie franchise ... if not were for the flacks. <br /> <br /> Tearing out the memory or history of Doc, and having the movie <br /> <br /> But the destruction of the legacy like it was no less abominable than putting a baby in kill the manger. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come on the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons by the unconscious to Indiana Jones, but it must be done seriously and earnestly for the glory we would of the First American Superhero expect, to recover. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OR EVIL, and it's much more serious. Yes, simultaneous footage was shot, but especially shots and very few actors. And yes, there's one side of Ron Ely jumping over a brick wall and shooting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze gun. Ely wears a cloth over a button under a white shirt with a bronze seal, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OR EVIL ... Upcoming next summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio flacks that George Pal accompanied to San Diego for the convention in 1975, the idiots hit the head and call the idiots they are. At that time, they made village knobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and bags of trousers and wore Paramount portfolios.
