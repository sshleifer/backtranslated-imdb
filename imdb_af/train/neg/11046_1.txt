It's probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, bad stuff. In the last 15 minutes, a cat-fit cyborg has been set that clogs everything. Malcom MacDowell needed a home payment, otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this shit and look in the mirror every morning. I could have done better special effects in my bath. There is no continuity. The editor should have fallen asleep or on drugs it is so bad. Acting. Do they have to smoke to be bad? The gun shoots blue flames or dots, makes you mind. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much confusing. .What is it called 2013 Seadly Wake. It has nothing to do with the movie
