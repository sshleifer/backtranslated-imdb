Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours in the makeup room every day watching the part of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today - unlike classic movie buffers - know about it. He was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could have won the Oscar for this show, which would give him two in a row, as he won it for Louis Pasteur the previous year. My own opinion is that while he was inclined to persuade a little, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age." Whatever he played; you were cut on the screen to see him. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the Pasteur role, I thought this story was a bit too much of what we saw in the past 60 years: go overboard to make a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not repress its contempt for the police or the army, and it made it a point to tell us how "corrupt" those organizations are. Filmmakers just like it when authority is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this film is far away from the day as we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts support this story. It also does not reduce Zola's achievements as a social reformer, to get rid of some evils. Good for him! I wish they spent more time concentrating on one trial.
