From the opening dialogue and scenes I knew I knew I was in a train wreck. I didn't want to look, but couldn't turn away. If it wasn't for the more eye candy of this movie, I'd have given one star. The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior is so far gained, added by poor direction and horrible story, makes this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good movie. But this movie failed so terribly that there was no chance to recover. <br /> <br /> If you walked out in the woods, your girlfriend's best friend died of an unknown disease, other friends who had gone around in a strange spot, what would you do ? <br /> <br /> A. Away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Have sex with your friends girlfriend. C.) Make a warm bath to relax your sadness to shave your legs. D.) Bash in the head your childhood best friend and lifelong loved one with a spade. E.) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, nothing of the answers is that far. In fact, everyone is plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations, throws this movie in the forefront at your local rental shop. Stay away. Stay far away.
