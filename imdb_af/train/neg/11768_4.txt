This reload is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but much understated 2003 "The Incredible Hulk". <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a comic book for the thinking person. The Hulk takes time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does, we see the conflict in the lead of our protagonist. He does his best to prevent him from losing control, but if he admits to giving it into his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this with Edward Norton's turn, where there is no conflict in his personality, and he turns in the Hulk when he gets excited and his pulse beats 200 beats per minute (not 183, but 197, but exactly 200). For this reviewer it felt that the introduction of midi chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tells how strong the "power" is, is as if mystical abilities can be measured through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner must do to keep his pulse below 200, as monitored by a device pinned on his wrist. And for the record it is extremely difficult to reach your pulse rate of up to 200, even by a very exciting race, especially for a fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He suppressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but underneath there is significant anger, enough anger to burn the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never deliberately kills, even its attackers. Mostly he just wants to get away or near Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He owns his gunmen and in one critical scene he saves a fighter plane that carries on a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but if needed. The action screens (and many of them) are needed to insert the plot, in contrast to the 2008 movie, where action for the sake of action. <br /> <br /> In his quest to make it a "refugee" story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. For him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an incorrect experiment. And Louis Leterrier, the director who picks up Ed Norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner Hulk relationship. The story can be summed up as: Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt, Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt. Repeat as needed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it may not be as true for comic books as the 2008 version. Although I'm a fan of the comics, I prefer a movie that's not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream, but I have a heart on the comic-loyal but crafted and rare 2008 version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Ang Lee should read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has a heart.
