Another violent, fierce fantasy by Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it is difficult to tell whether he is serious about his sordid impulses, with sardonic intent or in full oblivion. He also looks totally ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant footage in the world (and that's some outstanding) can't hide a negligence from story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses himself in moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a lovely actor who sometimes shows his dark side ('The River Wild') in an effort to set off his son-like appearance; Give the material, but Bacon is not nearly hateful to force. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. None of them are talented enough to make a solid impression and, when forced to make an inward dialogue, are ashamed of themselves. The climax is a study of consideration and unbelief must really be suspended.
