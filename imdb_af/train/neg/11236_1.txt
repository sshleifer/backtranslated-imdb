As a former Kalamazoo resident with a love for the town, I look forward to the movie. But what a disappointment! Although the acting and production values ​​are not bad, the fright is terrible, the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this movie is that women are nothing without men and children. I can hardly believe how regressive it is in the view of women. Did the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassment to the city after which it is named.
