As the summary says, you've just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard on an RPG. Did you seriously think they were gay? Are you delayed? If you go, save your best friend and someone decides from the goodness of his heart to help you, then you are in serious debt to that man. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other. This made them closer than friends. They weren't gay lovers like you bitch. And to let you know, the game is in a medieval era. Earlier, women only prepared meals while the men fought. Do you even know your history? Do you know how long it took women to be accepted into the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, although you in vain also want to catch it, and you really have to prove a solid proof of ignorant assumptions based on your wrong act to interpret the story.
