Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most talented comedians in the film today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can only get mad, and we love him. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (Ala Ace Ventura), and makes them decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', they make the latest hilarious contemporary comedies. Carrey also proved that he was able to tackle dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show'. The man is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Then, Bruce Almighty, an ideal vehicle for Carrey, comes as a point of departure; Carrey, after complaining about God and how his life stinks, is activated with God's powers. However, the script is purely recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an incomprehensible scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be released, because so much of the comedy relies on foolish special effects, some of which are just amusing. Carrey can rarely be improvised because he has to work for the special effects. The authors apparently thought that all these special effects and super-power ranges were funny, as the rest of the movie is simply stuffing that Carrey offers nothing else to work with a shiny, totally humorous character. He looks more like a 5 year desire for our attention, because the viewer needs to find what he's doing funny, if it's really just annoying. <br /> <br /> I always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on friends and she was excellent in last year's "The Good Girl." She also has a gift for comedy, but with the writing as linear as it is, she is only given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as crunchy, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> 'Bruce Almighty' had to be a comedy. But it doesn't even have the gaps to tackle the topic that makes it fun; religion. A few little giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it just turned into a comic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it is shifting from fool to heavy hands, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails at almost every level. It is not to see that it is completely without laughter, but it is close. Any movie that has the need to collect scenes from a dog to make it laugh has problems. But hey, if you find jokes jokes, it goes. <br /> <br />
