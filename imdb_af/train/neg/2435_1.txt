I will warn you here: I chose to believe the judges who said it was not an ordinary action movie, rather a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on the basis and it would be good . <br /> <br /> I'm here to tell you they were wrong. Totally wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not quite; It is very disappointing if you are looking for an action movie, it was right. But it is also very unsatisfactory on all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not bad, I suppose, not worse than usual; but what did they have to throw Billy Zane into it? Was it a kind of death wish of the producers? A way to make their movie a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they are actually aiming for success, why not throw someone up? Oh, and can just go for a scriptwriter who knows how to write. Oh, yes, and a director who knows how to guide. <br /> <br /> If someone who puts through this mess really believes that it will leave himself soon, I can assure you that it never did. Sorry, this could have been a good movie.
