Wow, I hated this movie. The subject had to be a very fine movie, and the main actor was certainly sensitive and talented enough to handle the subject, but the writing - even if there was a writing - was a mess. It's less a movie than a random slideshow that goes nowhere. I'll say it's going nowhere fast, except that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever go through. As I mentioned, the main actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), As his sometimes difficult-but-ultimately loving-and-accepting mother. The filmmakers have a lot to answer here, because it's a mess. A real shame, because I liked this movie, but it's basically a movie that's never been made. Skip this one - it wasn't even worth claiming the $ 6 I spent on pay-per-view.
