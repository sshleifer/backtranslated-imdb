Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, centers around three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I am concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight man who is shamelessly knocked down by a gay man. <br /> <br /> The "couple" really doesn't have much of a role in the movie. There are some scenes that show how they want to be aggressive when they have sex or play with each other, but they have no real purpose because they are so marginalized. My assumption is that they have a more daily illustration of how sex / violence is integrated into a couple's life. The couple are not very aggressive and are not even shot in any erotic way. As characters, they do not add much to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in a gay bashing or sorting by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in a alley. It escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a way of sexual gratification. And their need for violence is released as the film progresses. The biggest problem I had was the violence was not convincing. Not once does it seem any of the characters are in any real danger. It just doesn't work. Since the whole theme of the movie is about the characters' relationships with violence, it's a big problem. Unfortunately, the makeup doesn't help either. Sometimes it's okay, other times it's very bad. In one scene I really wondered why one of the characters blotted rouge on his face. Confusion. <br /> <br /> The more interesting few characters are the "stalker pair." Here, Calson had more to say and could develop a more coherent story. Perhaps this is because the characters seem to be developing and eventually deciding. Shiner might have been much better off holding it with these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wants to reach this movie a lot. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks do not strive too much. I don't think Calson had scored because he was looking. I didn't find anything particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was unconvincing. However, this does not mean that the director cannot achieve anything with his next film. <br /> <br /> He has something to say.
