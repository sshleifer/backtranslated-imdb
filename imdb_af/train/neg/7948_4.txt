"The seventh sign" borrows a lot from "Rosemary's baby" and "the omen" (it actually combines the two stories). Even his title reminds of Bergman's "seventh seal". <br /> <br /> However, it starts off well enough, with all the revolutions scattered across the earth, and in parallel, a seemingly clear plot with Moore's husband trying to make a poor boy (what killing his parents brother and sister of the death penalty. Time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to salvation (even the walking Jew is involved), who sometimes make the lines unintentionally funny (Have you ever been to Sunday school? But they taught me that God was love!). scenic IMHO, is the short dialogue between priest John Heard. He doesn't look serious about things, badly he's not given a more important part, because his retired scene is invaluable - and the young Jew. <br /> Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as former man Bruce Willis: save the world. She didn't save the movie for everything.
