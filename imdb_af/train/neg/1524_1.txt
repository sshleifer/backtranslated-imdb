Words failed me. This movie was extremely difficult to watch and I really wish I didn't. Although I tried to endorse it to the end, I have to admit that I could not spend more than one hour, so my opinion may be unfair. However, this film will require the most impressive third in the history of filmmaking, so it will get an overview that is nothing but angry. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch any part of this movie. .
