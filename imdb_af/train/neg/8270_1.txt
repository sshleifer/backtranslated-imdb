Non-existent plot, tons of poorly-directed / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world renowned snipers who can't even beat their targets a few meters away) and what's up with the end? ---> A lot of law enforcement officers are damaging a carnival's shooting gallery? WTH?), Technical errors (how many dots can you fit in a glock magazine? 100 + these people burn their guns without reloading). The movie is so bad that even old Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can save this junk. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie (I realized I lost some good 100 minutes of precious life on this one). Hopefully the director will also stop making movies, or learn more about his next movie.
