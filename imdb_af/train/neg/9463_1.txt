Meaning of enthusiastic and well-rounded adaptation to the classic children's story not only lacks the charm of his ancestor, but has no talent. Not only should Mike Myers be ashamed of himself for his terrible performance, it is a clear rhythm of what Jim Carrey did, but he must stop acting. He is so annoying that you want to knock the shit out of him if you could jump right into the movie. The sets are ugly and cinematography is very poor. I've seen very bad movies this year, but it doesn't just take the cake, but it's definitely one of the worse movies ever made.
