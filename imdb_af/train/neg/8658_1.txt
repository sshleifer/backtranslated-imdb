A large portion of the screens should be cut off. There are many scenes to cut off. For example, the scene where the hunters call "I have spiders on my dick", "I like dick", play in the mud scene or a bar scene where a professional dinocroft hunter's main work is a snake marker. <br /> <br /> How about other terribly disjointed scenes with a woman, Diane who wants to lose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks as he wears the woman's panties, three sizes too small. While they are making love, didn't they realize they're making it next to the little boy, who is running away and losing his head? Why did they live in a living room? I mean, his head really turned around. How about the beach scene reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene at Grant Lake. All this strange scene can easily be re-recorded as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my local village, the cineplex theaters have been advertising Dinocroc for months and I'm glad I didn't watch it because I found out later, it was only for 1 or 2 days before cancelled. The movie was so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie watching the show. It features the leg of Dinocroc which looks like a child with green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old. It can easily be transferred as Baby Geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any student wants to learn about filmmaking that isn't doing it, it's a true classic trash. As Diane's boyfriend walks like an advanced case of syphilis, you wonder what the poor woman sees in the drunk guy before drinking beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The pantsman looks more interesting than the whole movie by Dinocroc. His performance was so bad, he made a much better substitute for Mr. Bean. Move over ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comic talent in a horror sci-fi flick. Maybe the worse is decisive in Hollywood's history.
