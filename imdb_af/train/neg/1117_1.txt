I don't know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always dark, except for seconds a day. There is a long time, shots of insects of all kinds interrupt for no reason. What a small dialogue there is in the movie is just as relentless and stupid as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow, she gets pregnant overnight and is then shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. I've never been blown away by how bad and useless a movie can be. Honestly, I want someone to see it so they can tell me what they're thinking about. But I don't want this level of hell to wish anyone else.
