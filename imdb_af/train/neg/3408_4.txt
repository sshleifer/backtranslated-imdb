I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember this clearly. We learned about space. All the little kids want to go to space, right? Well, after I saw it, I was so scared to kill that I was accidentally thrown into space by a psychotic robot with a single mind. I had no idea that it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I think it was my own version of when people were affected by the radio program 'War of the Worlds'. "So, recently, I get to watch this movie again, realizing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I laughed at the dramatic parts and laughed even harder at the acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, does she move slowly, have you ever seen it? I don't think to be in space, make you talk slowly or think it's slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is hit unconscious by the oxygen tank, and starts drifting backwards as the security doors close. Little Max tries to penetrate her. Suddenly we get a big close-up on Max's face as he screams (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
