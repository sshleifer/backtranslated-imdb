As a girl, Hinako moved away from her small town to Tokyo, behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She came back as a young woman, surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She reunites with Fumiya and they are shocked to learn that Sayori is secretly raised through the island of Shikoku. O boy. I hired it because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is an avid actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be fruitful. This movie is stupid, boring, poorly filmed, unattractive, and mostly rude. Kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected Sayori, and her character is given little to work with.
