A group of friends come face to face with a family of boring cannibals while camping in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The 'mutant cannibal family' concept is almost as old as the hills that the innate freaks often call at home, such a director trying to breathe new life into the genre needs something special. make to impress. With Barricade Timo Rose tries to give the well-behaved routine a teutonic twist by performing the action to the Black Forest and giving it the German lower-budget squatter treatment. The result is a very bloody, but totally irreplaceable effort that is almost immovable, thanks to some terrible legal decisions. In particular, the continuous use of fancy filters and annoying editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Had Timo Rose not chosen to offer every nudge that his modification software offered, Barricade might be a pretty entertaining gore: his inexperienced role play is pretty good; the bloody effects are suitable for gastric glands; And there are one or two scares and even some well-thought-out mischievous moments. However, all of this is completely ruined by the horrible camera work, bumpy editing, and the overwhelming barrier of visual gimmickry, the film has the distressed look so inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the alien gore, which includes a fine scene where a man is pressed to drink acid, very nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp tools, and some nice decent shotgun damage.
