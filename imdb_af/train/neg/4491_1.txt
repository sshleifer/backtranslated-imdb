1/10 and that's just because I'm not lower with my ratings. <br /> <br /> Skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie of the "Trilogy", don't buy it or rent it. trust me that you will not miss anything. the architect brings no new information: _ (spoiler) _ there are more neos in front of him, he is like no 6 or something. You can already see something like this from the first movie: Agent Smith tells us that the first Matrix did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where have I seen it before? Oh, right in the first movie, the roles where reversed! the same as the action scenes, nothing new with more opponents. The action scene (the 20+ ships) in the BIG fight we didn't see (maybe in Revolutions?) Betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the man who holds the knife that Neo wants to stick?!) What the EGM button too soon. <br /> <br /> All in all, a shameless ploy to earn money (especially from the guys who saw it more than once), who apparently worked like a charm.
