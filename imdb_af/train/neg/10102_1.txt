If there ever was a movie that earned a big fat-zero rating, this is the stack of crap. I love zombie movies and even bad people usually have something for them, but not this atrocity. I actually started to feel angry at watching this movie, because it is so insulting, I can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think it was acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. People don't respond, act or look like people. The whole movie is also shot in two rooms that are nicely decorated to look vague like the places where they are supposed to be. The whole thing is an infinite mess, it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally come up, it looks dirty and doesn't do much. <br /> <br /> I can make a better movie than that, so you and someone who has never seen a movie can. It's pitiful and undoubtedly the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Honest, the worst movie of all time. You will notice that the only positive reviews give it a 10/10 and ask you to buy the DVD. I can't imagine anyone neutral really thinking it's a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and it's generous.
