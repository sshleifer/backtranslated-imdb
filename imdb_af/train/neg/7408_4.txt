I don't quite know why I clicked "spoiler" because honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough about what it is supposed to spoil. <br /> <br /> Visually, it usually produces. Well, apart from about 80's throw back rubber mask samples. I will now say that I have not seen the band Lordi before and nothing of them knew they had won Eurovision. Apparently, the samples are members of the group, pretty much in their stage personas. Whatever. Anyway, I didn't know it while I was watching. I just thought the monsters / demons were mostly acceptable. Approximately. <br /> <br /> I'm almost certain there is a semi-coherent statement behind what we see on the screen, but it may actually be better not to know it. It would probably have been really nice to think about it. The action keeps it good enough to entertain the viewer, especially if half of the entertainment factor jokes about the wtf, this movie has to happen exactly. <br /> <br /> I gave it a four-fold because I got a good laugh out of it, especially how it explains about nothing. The mood I was supposed to have been, but I found some reason to be funny. Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOW knows what the hell is about. This made me even more amused and my score increased an extra half point to a 4/10. <br /> <br /> It's not scary or coherent, but it's pretty pretty visual and sonic. Overall, far from essential, but viewable. Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make sense and it may entertain you when you're in the right mood.
