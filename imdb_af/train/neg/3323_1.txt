I watched many cartoons or animated movies, because I have a baby girl who likes watching television. I watched this movie to see if I wanted to see my little one to watch it ... and no. Initially I thought it was such a cute movie like the Bambi movie, but the way it was like the ducky was a homosexual. The information said they were happy about him because he was not good sport, but that was not the case. It looks like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay. It was also very sad, as far as the ducky's father and everyone. I don't know, I think if you're gay, you want it, but I don't think I'm going to look with my little one again.
