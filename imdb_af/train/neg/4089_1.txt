Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said, "almost". This is nothing more than many random scenes that are merged into a loose story. The protagonists (you can't call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob it for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoerotism, which turned me off. (SPOILER: It seems that the villain (who is just topless and not naked as other reviews claim) is killed early, but miraculously restored and adds another 70 minutes of hearing torture.) I can't feel the animal shaking many times occurred in this cinematic horror. If you are in a MST3K mood, you can see it, but for the most part you can forget about it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead.
