... but for a movie trying to market him as a horror, there was a clear lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of skilled directing, acting, editing and writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London has one of the most horrific acts I have ever seen - his descent into the melee of madness is painfully self-conscious and clumsy. Oh, look at him! Oh, look at him, drink strong spirits! Oh, look at him, lift his forehead and pull his head at an angled corner! Oh, look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh, listen to his sad voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, the denser shirt comes, it's another boy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Poe.) Oh, for the love of ... did anyone give this man a guide on how to do well or they pulled him out of a box somewhere, the defective plastic toy price in a finished brand of bargain -grain. Okay, it was a stupid line - but that's just because London's performance melted my brain with its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is cute and very breezy, but has not yet grown into her drama. this movie - she delivered her lines as she got up. In fact, her whole show was very wood, her stiff as her lines - who knows, maybe she just responded and tried to neutralize Jeremy London's flailing surplus, but if so, she took it to far. <br /> <br /> Notable is Arie Verveen as Poe - while his character's role is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. He looks straightforward, but it's more than that - he has a depth, I believe he has a life beyond the two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I love Poe, and can only make my mind go astray and find out while on the screen - whatever, he has an interest factor that is otherwise missing. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there's all the usual caricatures: the beautiful blonde best friend who is a bit of a floozy; the beaten local policeman who is a bit of a dork; the protective older man who may have too much unfaithful interest in our heroine; the scheming old witch, etc, yawn, yawn. <br /> <br /> As with the 'clear lack of blood for a horror movie problem, none of the themes they mention (and that London's character - so scary - gets into his attack on Poe's writing) followed by on. As another reviewer has said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - really shocking things, but instead, they get rid of the issues and cut away from the violence (an elevated candlestick that swings through the air) it on the victim - then It is fine in a Noirish traditional horror, and it is expected, and is received as pleasantly as it happens, which is a dear convention, especially when accompanied by false lightnings and intense Sioux eye makeup - but in 'Descendant' it just seems awkward, or as if the editor got angry at the last moment and cut it out. or a simple and fun slasher movie: it tries to be both or not (something new and exciting!), but it doesn't fail either. The only horror element of this whole movie is it's epic dull. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there was one) should have been drunk when he lifted this thing - there were awkwardly shortened scenes; scenes that were out of order (but it could only have been the poor writing). Just like the director and filmographer - there were some very strange shots and frameworks that I believe were meant to pay tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but eventually only became stupid (again good in a noir, but that was something else . <br /> <br /> The whole thing might have become funny (in the way previous reviewers mentioned - "OMG, how did it do?!") If I were in the mood for a few trash - Unfortunately, I sat on the couch, with the light lights, with the express intention of making myself stupid - it's a very poor movie and I'm afraid I can't recommend it to people, even to laugh. <br /> <br /> Please, don't waste your time or money on this - or borrow a real horror / thriller movie, or find yourself a copy of Poe's fantastic stories, I'll be a lot more enjoyable and frightening have a night than you ever could with this garbage.
