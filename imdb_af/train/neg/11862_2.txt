This movie probably has a potential for something; My outrage is how these totally prosaic unfunny themes keep making theaters. It's as if ideas are being recovered just because generations are. Truly the decerebrates behind most movies are like dogs, they return to take their own vomiting. Well, they're now $ 19 richer because of me. It was not imaginative, there wasn't a saving moment, anything else was funny in the trailer (and nothing was amusing in the trailer). Achievements were tense (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homurotic friend with a fondness for Disney movies; None of his analogies went home, his small moral speeches were flat, I literally waited to go and say something meaningful, just to find out he was done. The so-called "hard 10" is the most unobtrusive plastic there is (apart from a horse-like face with a strange smile); I honestly found that her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) looked much better than her. But then again men prefer the darkest;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial, and if love is true, it surpasses all social facades; The way they showed it, with a man shearing another's shot and the premature ejaculation routine of the million-time-mutilated-and-death-horse couple (with clear indications on American Pie and Happiness - the last in the disgusting scene renunciation the family dog). I feel as if the movie was like a ridiculous joke in a miserable miserable ball of raw sewage. Going to show marketing can push anything there, pour some impatient mass and call it gold, people will come (work for me). Done with tirade.
