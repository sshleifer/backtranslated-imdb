Oh dear sir. This movie ... It was terrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was wonderful, I will say. But this plot was terrible. It does not make sense! It had gone too far, and an unnecessary (and rebellious) sex scene at the beginning. I believe the director was trying to be "shocking" or not, but it just found out terribly. To add to the stack of physical shit, they called a plot, the actors (except 'scarecrow') are terrible, and I care so little about what I soon forgot who was who. Finally, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie, please do.
