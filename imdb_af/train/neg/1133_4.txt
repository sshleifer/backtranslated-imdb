I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one. Many of the scenes work in a plug-and-play way strictly inserted to comply with the romantic comedy genre. Usually it is okay because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge is usually to make it original, new and inventive. This movie fails to do so. <br /> <br /> There is no sense for who the characters really are, except Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich√© and become nothing more than simple dolls that serve the purpose of a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The pacing of the movie can be annoying, lack of rhythm and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I also need to mention the exaggerated stylized decors, which make some scenes unnatural, or rather the attempt of obviously obvious. Of course, along with that, you have the right-to-cue juicy music that unfortunately often doesn't match. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that a movie that makes Woody Allen obvious is ultimately this misleading. If you expect a good light romantic comedy, it is not. Or rather, this is a poor attempt to do so. You will just leave the theater and wonder why this movie gets so much praise if the cinema is over 100 years old and there are much better Quebecois directors who make better movies. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a great movie for what it is. But it is a bad one if you consider the cinema as an art and director as an author.
