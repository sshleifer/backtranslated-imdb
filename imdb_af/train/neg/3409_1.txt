Rumors have it that when NASA Technical Advisers are asked for this movie to keep the picture credible, they laughed for a few hours. Finally, unless you're a politician or work / crew, you're not going to get into the shuttle. Furthermore, Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama, not Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on earth will win more than one billion dollars before the events depicted in this film have ever become possible. This film is intended for children and had to be written by one because they are unaware of the numerous restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> It's the most useless movie of all time, and it was a well-deserved flop.
