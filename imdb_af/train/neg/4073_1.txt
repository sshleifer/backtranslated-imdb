NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but it must be the poorest attempt to ever make one. To call it a movie is also a stretch. This "random-clips-of-obviously-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-ugly-woman-try-to-really-sexy-edit-bad" is not worth looking at. <br /> <To look at it, it's about as interesting to look as a random family's vacation photos. It has about the same quality as you would expect when sending your 10-year-old boy in the forest with your new vid cam and telling him a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
