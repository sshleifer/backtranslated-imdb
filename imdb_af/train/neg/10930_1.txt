This movie is a total dog. I drank myself to find anything to just laugh. I will not feel that I have completely wasted my money - and my time. The writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. It is a pity this is not the standards of other Hale Storm movies. <br /> <br /> They had to save the money to get D-list actors such as Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and devoted the money to work until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you wonder what the point of most of the plot was - including the subplots. After watching this movie, I left the impression that the producers were hoping to catch some kind of Napoleonic dynamic humor, where it is not as much as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, characters, delivery or humor. Rather, I had to go to the dentist!
