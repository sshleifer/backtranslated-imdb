THE. Worst. Film. Ever. Made. <br /> <br /> Having watched these so-called gay movies, I suspect somebody has erected a brain-damaged semi-blind neo-Nazi and made him the worst gay movie ever, all in an attempt to gay culture to fall. . I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over, just so I had someone to scare when I kept the movie out of shock, disbelief and indignation at such stupidity. <br /> <br /> In addition, the horrible writing and acting and illogical and silly plot, it's just a bad movie. A dog with a glove tied to its tail could have been better cut out. <br /> <br /> After reading the few positive reviews, seriously, I suspect the author should have a half-dozen IMDb account. Anyone who says this movie is even visible as something other than a joke, is a liar or is paying heavily to say it.
