OK. I think the TV show is cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved. When my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to take it together. I wish I stayed at home and watched the TV show. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and original is the least of the problems with this movie. The plot is next to the non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and worst of all, Gadget carries no lesson whatsoever. It seems that Disney has taken all the things Inspector Gadget has on TV and throws them all. To be honest, my younger child (8 years old) had the movie, but the parent (10 years old) woke up and it was stupid (he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any adult humor). <br /> Generally, I like Disney movies, but this one misses a mile. It's good for a very small age group (say 7 to 9), but one should miss everyone else.
