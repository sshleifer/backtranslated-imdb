Okay, I saw a lot of movies with witches and the occult, but this one was just strange. This movie, like this cult of witches, is led by a very bad Orson Wells who plays the staring role (they couldn't find someone who looked more like a Satanist). He didn't hear in this movie at all. But anyway, the coven takes a new member and puts a doll that looks like someone and makes her a miscarriage. The lady who had the miscarriage and her husband went to a place called Lillith on buses and the woman now saw an image of her sister or anyone calling it to her and warning her to stay away from there and never her. use powers. there or she will die The couple, after settling in the foreign town, discover that all the residents are all witches and she becomes angry and afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen if the lady discovers a funeral that goes on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was creepy), as well as seeing the son of Orson Wells at the scene he later asked the woman to help him bring back to life. The lady is soon trying to escape the town, but only to get herself trapped by his inhabitants and powers and to ignore herself all that the spirit is trying to warn her. This movie is good, it's the moment of tension, but it could have done much better than having Orson there.
