I rented this movie because I was hoping it would be one that the whole family would enjoy. Although the movie is family-friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you are not guaranteed. Your soccer team won't always win. You won't get better points. Infertility is not always cured. You won't always get a raise. Sometimes you will be held with the old car. <br /> <br /> God doesn't exist to meet us all look. We were rather created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify Him most when things go bad for us. To live is Christ; to die is profit.
