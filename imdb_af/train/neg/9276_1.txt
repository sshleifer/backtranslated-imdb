It's a really miserable little movie. The original (un) sacred trinity is indeed regulated by the law of declining returns with the third, "The Final Conflict" which unleashed in a ludicrous subplot halfway through the film, apparently merely to provide the necessary unnecessary complicated deaths what is now the whole raison d'etre for the "omen" series. But then to give this jumped TV movie (beware the buyers of the Omen box on DVD - don't be fooled by the wide screen ratio of the transfer, it was and is strict screen species) on the back of a series of over the generally fine demonic chillers were unforgivable, especially as endorsed by the exec producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I will give away the plot if any, except the usual deaths (hopelessly amount to TV sensitivity) and of the worst acting I've seen. Everyone involved in this project to caterers must be ashamed of this travesty it has ever made on the screen. If one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better for it.
