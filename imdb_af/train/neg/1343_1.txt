We bought this movie from a shop called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration than we previously bought the movie No Big Deal. This made us expect to make this movie very inspiring so we could relive it and put it on the tube. However, it was shocking. BORING is the main word to remember. The bad effects and the writing are not enough to make you look. The main woman's body looks right at the right moment in a pathetic attempt to interest the viewer. But it just makes you wonder, did they blow the budget to pull her out? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a home-made movie, the shots don't even match and the camera works so amateur it makes us remakes of bad movies professionally. I can't believe it's sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> It's just a chest and uncomfortable to watch. The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
