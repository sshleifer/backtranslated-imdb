A young boy sees his mother killed and his father hangs himself. 20 years later he gathers a lot of friends to perform an exorcism on himself so that he will not challenge like his father. All the stock characters are in place: the beautiful couple; the "funny" guy; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses - that's how we know); the nerd and two non-personality blondes. It all involves a dull wooden image that comes to life (don't ask) and kill people. I knew I was in trouble when we jumped for a big openingstone 20 years later - ALL bad horror movies do it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is horrible, the acting is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) and the murders are stupid and / or relentless. My favorite scene is when two people have sex and the image knocks the man off the bed to show he is full of clothes! A real bad, silly, incoherent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
