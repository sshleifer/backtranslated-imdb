This movie released directly to video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and subject the viewer to terminal boredom. It is another thinly veiled, disillusioned religious film with the good guys (the believers) suddenly disappearing and leaving the bad guys (the non-believers) behind. This is an interesting concept, especially as we see it on a flight captain by a non-believer who has a sinful relationship with a flight attendant (unnecessary to say that the sinner also doesn't disappear!). Unfortunately, with all the pilots who were not believers, the plane did not break or the movie would be gracious. Although it may have been interesting without the heavy religious eyebrows, as a whole, the plodding movie makes one gag, the play is awful and the naturally computer-generated simulations are very fake. Plus it's another movie shot in Canada that seems to be New York City. Save me ... I'll just read the Bible.
