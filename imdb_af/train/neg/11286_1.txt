Where do you start with a movie as bad as this? <br /> <br /> Do you call the role of indifferent heroes? The over-the-top acting? The horrible script? <br /> <br /> No. You just say that someone who pays money to see a movie as poor as it should look at their head. I know I do. I respect the poor guys who have seen it with little or no preface, like the Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available for quality film magazines). However, the theater should really start thinking about repayment if the client is not satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> Three days after opening with two other friends, I went. The only other person in the theater was on his own one block. <br /> <br /> It was on cheap night. <br /> <br /> The advertising campaign also failed or the word spread most. from the land of just what is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Not since the days of The Avengers (1998), I changed so briefly since I watched a movie. If a friend follows it on the video in a few months, make sure he pays your electricity bill while you watch it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award not to crack - or run off the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity amidst the cinematic massacre; Barry Foster was arrested on the scene for his performance. Rhys Ifans does not favor his career with the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway like a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, She was earlier in the Word, any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to get started. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad because of the obviously limited budget, but the writing is horrible. . If you want to hear a lot of indifferent characters, say "Fuck!" For a few hours then it should be upright in your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, need barge poles. <br /> <br />
