Although the book was not strictly accurate for the actual situation it described, it still felt Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie ever was in Japan as it didn't feel Japanese in the slightest. Almost everything about it was terrible. I would admit that the actors were generally pretty good, but couldn't afford to save it. Before the movie started, I was surprised that only ten people were in the theater on Friday night, shortly after the movie opened in Japan. For 30 minutes I was surprised they stayed. I stayed so that I could have the right to criticize it. The whole movie was my happiness and suppressed laughter of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw running out of that cinema had confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /> <br /> For the makers of this movie, you owe me two hours.
