It was the WORST Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two little children to see it. It was the darkest, most dull plot. The family has no money, mom loses her job, father is killed in the bank. Bank robber steals family vehicle with both children in the back and at high speed, drives the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is left alone. No wonder her Christmas spirit is gone. Christmas angels do not save children who have drowned, and Santa does not return dead fathers back! I thought it was the WORST message to send children. Better tell them there is no guy, they show a movie like this !!
