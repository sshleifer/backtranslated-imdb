***** THIS OVERVIEW MAY BE SPOILERS - But that provision would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story ***** <br /> <br /> The CINDERELLA story is my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. It can't work if the story goes off or tries to throw interesting ideas along with some magical photography and spectacular search design designs with poor direction and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches. or sooner, never turn into a swan. <br /> <br /> All the value of money that can buy money can't buy good movie-like timing and dramatic development - or good acting. <br /> <br /> The entry of Cinderella to the ball as badly done, there was no drama of anticipation or excitement of discovery. <br /> <br /> The writing also made me very nervous. The Prince Charming was the most undesirable memory. Why would any girl with a drill, self-absorbed prince want to marry what women didn't like? <br /> <br /> Turner's step on the stepmother role was an embarrassment that showed painfully showing one-liners more than acting nuance. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella part had little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence will describe this effort: As cheap '90s, <br /> <br /> What MUST be called and named in a shameful excess is the glorious photography, carpet and production design . It was a pleasure to see the landscapes, sets and settings as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella storytelling, go to two jewels: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stages of TV-60s watching the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - bar none. An all-star cast makes everything possible to offer the highest entertainment. Engaging, distracting and memorable writing and music. This is the classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Only then - this Drew Barrymore jewel maintains the historical perspective, changes the story line, but not enough to derail the effective development of the key points of this classic story. The characters of the principals and of all the supporting roles were cleverly written and acted well.
