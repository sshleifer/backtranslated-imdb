I passed this one on the shelf a few times, looking at the many positive quotes (with small names) in front and wondering if I was missing something. The other night it was on one of the movie channels, and I agreed. I missed nothing. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I only watched the first 30 minutes. Maybe the movie is then comedy gold. Given the slow, speedy pace and the lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character starts the movie in classic "I don't know how to start my movie" style, with a long, tiring monologue on how he doesn't want to be heard. It's not funny. It's not just funny. Others commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a little chuckle the first time, he says. Then he cut it into the ground, smiling at the camera, that's the funniest thing ever written. Get ready. In fact, I think the talk with the camera is why I didn't like the movie right away. Don't accept familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is derived, much like respect. From there you basically have a fat, shiny guy who speaks in a very simple way about his dull life as a temp. I didn't realize he was Jewish; It is a discredit for Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor". It's just unfunny humor. Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you have a talent for the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-analytical humor than this man, so of course it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the pieces I've seen worked, I could have trapped. But some scholars talk about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, and then records for five minutes. It doesn't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is a clear effort to capitalize on the popularity of "office space". Don't become a victim of targeting yourself. Don't say no to "Haiku Tunnel".
