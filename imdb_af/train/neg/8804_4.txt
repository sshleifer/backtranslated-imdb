Great CGI effects and a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a once-off pony in this movie, how he was the best actor Oscar that year on Morgan Freeman, was a crime. <br /> <br /> This movie is a beautifully striking baby revival love letter, with a barely hidden right-wing bias, starting from Forrest's Vietnam service up to the "resolution" with Jenny at the end . <br /> <br /> That said, it is extremely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found some parts of this movie very offensive, Zemeckis almost immersing this movie to the level of Gump himself. . Maybe it was the point he was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie and ask yourself, "What is Robert Zemeckis saying what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to be the right choice and has been in the right place at the right time for the past 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So says Zemeckis that idiocy is disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even US quality?
