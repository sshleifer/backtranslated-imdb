The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without any waves. For viewers who like to navigate this movie, it will be a huge disappointment as the total number of minutes is up to three. <br /> <br /> The story is part of life about beach surfers who are not waiting for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super-surfer who flirts with a relationship with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to get lucky with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends arrive and convince him to find the beach looking for monster waves at Bone Yard. The problem is, there are no waves until the end of the movie, so most of the story dissipates on a winding sequence of closed beach events. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has some comic moments, but mostly his play was commonplace. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug-trafficking wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the cluster. The most wonderful show was probably named by Peter Gunn as Terry. He changed his body into a constant sight. Catherine Zeta-Jones was as usual as sexy, but her character didn't have enough meat to show her much acting ability. <br /> <br /> There is really not much here to comment. I evaluated it a 3/10. It is a real beach bummer.
