I decided to watch this one because it was nominated for Oscar this year. I think so many people here, I wanted this movie, but I was bored and disappointed. The first scene was OK, but the rest of the movie in the "shaky hands" camera mode is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for making such a movie and nomination for Oscar is this: <br /> <br /> American "military machine" (people making money in war) urgently Need an excuse or justification for the war in Iraq by doubling something (kind of) patriotic. <br /> <br /> Why these director's and heroic "heroic" attempts to impress the audience with an idea of ​​"love-war-like-a-drug"? Oh, please, come on! what a drill! <br /> <br /> Look at this to get an idea of ​​how low the film academy can fall ...
