I recently saw it on a faded old VHS band and remember it slenderly. Looking at it now, it looks like it's charming. <br /> <br /> When it was first released, it was almost everyone recognized as a ghost to come out as a gay teenager. To hammer the point home, the mother is seen reading a paper copy of "1 teenager in 10", the most popular chosen book of the time. David Warner puts it up as the gay-hating evangelist, who is of course a self-destructive cupboard. The list of siggats and in-jokes included to make sure no one missed the point will be too long to go in. The producers have a little beloved fun and certainly hope to lift and light. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a teenage audience would see this movie these days. In some places, where there is education and culture, the frightening trials that gay teenagers had to go through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are many dark, nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was.
