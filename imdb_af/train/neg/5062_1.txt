This movie is bizarre. Put better, this is' freakin 'strange'. I could give you a plot summary, or some hay toity analysis, but I would be a waste of your time. All one needs to know about this movie is two young sisters, a cruel relationship, murder, post mortem mutilation, and a really disturbing imagination. At the end of the movie, you feel like you have to shower to wash off the dirt of yourself, but not in a good way like "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's as if you're a teenager (or high school is that I'm still a teenager) and just did something you wished you didn't do, and B: hope for the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about. And no one likes it. My advice is that rather than disregarding your thoughts and watching a piece of unconscious filth, just waste your time on something that is less terrible and see "Kazaam" (yes, I would rather "Kazaam" than "Murderous Maids "look, read what you want).
