So ... we see more footage from Brando ... interesting, but not exactly Oscar worthy things. Susannah York was barely a slouch. A new scene where Lois comes from Clark is Superman, is a bit incredible because he doesn't see spaces coming from the gun instead of real dots. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then pushed him to the floor, but forgot about it ... let's listen to Donner making fun of Lester's version that made more sense. The president speaks of the Zod who defiled the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Tweaking that scene made that line pretty absurd. Superman's "freedom of the press" line sounded like ".Care to step outside", which was better delivered and related to Clark's earlier scene in the truck stop. Then there is the end with the "turn the world back to go back in time" effect. It has turned everything around in the whole movie and wondered where the rocket aimed at Hackensack, N.J. ever has, since it's no longer Zod and company free.
