Interesting? Rare. The "scientific evidence" that the film provides for its point (which is basically that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can't believe Germans (even in that horrible time) want or believe this movie. Compare this with Riefenstahl's Triumph of Will. Now it was my movie for which I was impressed. <br /> <br /> The best part is a play by M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the Jew, as the announcer remembers us so much) Lorre plays a child-molester and killer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a corrupt mind can do it. Uh huh. Don't know that M Hitler's favorite movie was right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just plain STUPID. Even this is the Nazi propaganda genre. 10/02.
