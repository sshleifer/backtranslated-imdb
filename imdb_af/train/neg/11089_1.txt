A little good movie, but not a real story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder and was never found guilty. New Jersey State just didn't go away for a third time, like 20 years away. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Pass a lie test and leave free". He didn't take it. This film should never be made, but money speaks. Many people unfairly issued their lives in jail and undoubtedly more blacks than whites. Why choose a false story? <br /> <br /> Jens
