This movie is so incredibly bad that I felt almost sick to watch it. Up to this point, the other installments had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was exciting and stingy. Part 2 was discount and entertainment. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 has good music, good special effects, and a new, entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than I've ever seen. Alice, a much nicer blonde, of Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. In parts, this supposed Elm Street installment becomes soap in a day. The newer characters look hard, and even the sweet Alice has a slide on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this one. He looks tired and doesn't look so gruesome. Its one-liners look out of place and different, where as in Part 4 they can be pretty funny. Leslie Bohem's story never comes off the ground and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that it looks good to my grandmother! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
