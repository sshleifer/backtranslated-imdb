Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners were manic and very funny, of course they wrote the writing by Neil Simon. For some reason, the Neil Simons script is not used in this movie, and it flattens over and over again. Even the audience I never laughed at. The direction is very slow and boring and when there is a joke it is given away so that the joke dies, ie The couple have sex in the park. They announce it's a New York lighting. Well, we all know the lights go on and we will be able to see cute and cute. Goldie & Steve do a little stick. The whole movie winds are as follows ... a joke is set up and given away. Why has Goldies's hair never been refurbished in the movie? You will also notice every close-up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
