This movie is like real life, which I mean - not much happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the often invisible role (their invisibility is due to the "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> A big drill. No big surprise that Altman makes it clear - he's a very variable artist (yes we all have Gosford Park, but "Fun A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that The raw material is a John Grisham story, and the excellent role you will see by summarizing the glowing of your urgent slumber - truly makes it a masterpiece of bad movie. And no, it's not that bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
