Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. This is the cream of the crop, or if you tend to be more cynical, as it falls on (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it can be even worse than the two, as the two dropped my intervals on their stupidity. It only brought me pain and pain when the credits started rolling. No other movie hurt me. Now I know exactly why this movie is so incredibly horrible. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It's about a chip in a remote control car (?!) That's misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. <br /> <br /> The action that comes up is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and all, but looking at these boobytraps performed is rather funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't even learn (or even as much as smile) once, but I constantly went round and hoped the terrorists would nail the child. The bird, rather than providing comic relief, was infallible and irritating. <br /> <br /> The play, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to horrible. There's not a single good show here. Alex D. Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judged by their movie credits, watch) if they got off the road in a hurry ... well, that's it. <br /> <br /> I can see some people say, "Man, that's for the kids. Not so, man." Well, MAN, kids may like this, but they can get a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting it out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - see reviews for more) is better than that! <br /> <br /> In short, this is an irreparable horror movie. This was clearly reclaimed for the money, as it almost completely disengaged the first two; The only thing is that it also completely insults the first two. No human, child or otherwise should find any reason to see Home Alone. 3. Ever. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
