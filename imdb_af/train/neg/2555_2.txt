This movie is probably one of the worst horror flicks I've seen. The length was not long enough to include a good storyline. The way the foster parents died, too, was just ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies by falling into a shower after threatening an action figure, and the father was shot by a police officer? I can see where some originality was possible where they went, but it could have been better. Also, the stocking of it all made me squeeze before it was over. After hearing Lucy's name and finding out, it was "Lucifer," I wanted to gag. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but looked at the name. This is a man's name. It must be given to a male character. All in all, the movie was a drill and could use a better plot.
