A patient escapes from a mental hospital, kills one of his guards and then a university professor after taking his way to the local college. Next semester, the late trials' replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new series of murders. The dialogue is so clicked. It's hard to believe I could predict quotes in quotes. It's one of those cheap movies thrown in the midst of the 80's treasure era. Despite killing the heroine, it's just substandard junk. Horrible play, horrible text, horrible effects, terribly terrible !! "Splatter University" is just a spark to put your video recorder in when you can't do anything better, even though I'm previewing your headphone band, it would be more entertaining. Save it and hire "Girl's Nite Out" rather. <br /> <br /> Valued R for Strong Graphic Violence, Profanity, Short Nudity and Sexual Situations.
