A previous reviewer said the movie wasn't that bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies child molestation. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked, so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars. Why not get a full 10? Because the filmography was "agonizing", the child's body of shock was "unrealistic", and the fat friend was "annoying." Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American film in 1981 appeared scenes of a child with sex with a grown woman. I caught this steamy movie from a movie while staying at a showtime hotel. For me, even if the fat friend acted a storm and earned an Oscar, I would have to give the movie just 1 star. That TV's Howard Hessman played in the movie yesterday as he appeared in WCRP. This is particularly ridiculous. But don't use my word for it!
