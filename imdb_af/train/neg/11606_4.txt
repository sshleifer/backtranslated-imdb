Good enough with a few attractive images, but the small budget obstructs things. <br /> <br /> I also get the impression that they are trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in certain things like the cyber city and the AD police, then it might be your street. <br /> <br /> But basically, the low budget matrix is ​​cash, but not entirely without its own style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands. Worth watching if it's just for the soundtrack.
