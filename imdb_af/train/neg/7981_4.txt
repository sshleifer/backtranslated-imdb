The Rookie suffers so much. There are the random musical songs cut through the movie, the long-pointless writing and enough grid blocks to blast Jerry Lewis. Noonan and Leavitt don't know when to stop. It takes a full hour before the story finally comes to the main plot and the characters are destroyed. Then the guys start Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. It's a pity that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play the stupid, stereotyped Japanese guys. But it gets pretty tricky after switching between two sets of characters. Then it just ends. Even a naked July Newmar in a towel can't save this one. <br /> <br /> There is very little charm in the movie and it is over half an hour too long. The story just goes along with trying to set up and fail funny situations. Join Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face.
