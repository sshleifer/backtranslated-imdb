As a World War II naval history, and someone not proud of the country's history of racial relations, I look forward to this movie. What a shocking piece of shock. I made it about 3/4 of the way, but I had to turn it off at the sub-attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would discharge a torpedo at a DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then ending the DDE while it was submerged, is ominous. And it's just a little detail. The whole movie was poorly written, poorly directed and poorly performed. I agree with others on this advice that it could have been a good movie. It's as if they've decided, since all the crappy WWII propaganda films were made with a white-white role, they had to make one with black people. And as bad as old movies, it's actually worse. And it's almost out of false ads to head for Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turned out that they had very small roles. I have to believe the two fine actors were ashamed to be associated with this movie. I am finished. I gave this crap film far too much of my life.
