It's here. Ultimately, a movie that I can honestly say is worse than Larry the cable man: health inspector. Still, I am willing to bet the Wayan's brothers (hilarious), will make more money than I have ever been in my life over what will surely be one of the top five worst movies of all time, beyond my fifth grade outside class re-enactment of Romeo and Juliet. I really mean WHY would anyone ever see this movie unless they were paid. The comedy is weak and even though it is even funny jokes from the thin plot appearing in advertisements. Final word is this movie was a terrible fall for me. And the ads look so promising ...
