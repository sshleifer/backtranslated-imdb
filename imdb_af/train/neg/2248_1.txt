This movie is a big steam stick. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone was of the opinion that the Garland / Mason version should be reconsidered, nor why Styria was the first choice. <br /> <br /> For that matter, I have no idea why our people (Gay-Americans) are largely inclined to regard Styria as a kind of treasure. She at least, in my opinion, professionally picked a funny girl and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and hire the Judy classics, or even the original (a fine movie in your own right), but please, please, PLEASE PLEASE this stink pot!
