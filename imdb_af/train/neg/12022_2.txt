The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution leaves it. <br /> <br /> The movie has no pace, for one thing. It must be an exciting ride, but it is slow and more than a little boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the script and editing. There are not enough obstacles and reversals to detect tension, and there are scenes that don't really move the story very effectively. <br /> <br /> The producers had to have seen it in the script and insisted on a great rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the writer and the director, it will apparently not happen. Much of the acting is similar to flat and it's up to the director - all the actors did It was a pity, because with better writing, editing and direction it could have been a very good excitement.
