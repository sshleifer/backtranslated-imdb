F * ck Me! I saw some amazing movies in my time, but it takes the p * ss! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can't express in words how bad this movie really is. Besides the plot that isn't really there, the comic jaw is the hilarious horrible excuses for zombies; You know what I can do all day. Every thing in this movie is either silly, pointless, crazy or embarrassing. I speak for everyone who wants to watch this movie ... not! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say, I got it on my rack. It is hidden right at the goddamn bottom in the great hope. I couldn't even give this horse's apology for a movie away. That's how bad it is.
