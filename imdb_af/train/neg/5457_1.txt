An actor asks, "What is my motivation?", To understand his or her character. After this, these "docudrama", this vague and random farce, look at a viewer wondering what anyone's motivation was. <br /> <br /> This relentless progeny of the day (the Oprah show), missed by miles, is a great opportunity to explore. weight issues. <br /> <br /> His characters were all shallow and superficial, his story line is much less socially redundant than a "Simpsons" episode. It has been satisfactory to investigate the police as unprofessional and incompetent. It failed to present why the court could treat the main character, a female child molester, as differently as it has a male perk. <br /> <br /> Why did this undisputed woman start greeting her second grade student? started a relationship with him when he returned to her sixth class class? Why did the boy's mother testify to her? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, plus generation rationalization and greed. The movie didn't mention it. Why hasn't the viewer been informed that the victim's mother sold maintenance rights for print and television tabloids, and showed her adolescent son on The Today Show? That Mary Kay's lawyer had paid for, she requested a "Sun or Sam" law herself, so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder? <br /> <br /> Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right wing republican congressman, the American independent presidential candidate of 1972, the president of the John Birch Society? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career ended when he was found to have had children at his own community college, simply exposed when that mistress sexually mutilated their child? Nevertheless, Letourneau's father removed his children from "too liberal" Catholic schools to prevent all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education? <br /> <br /> A month after her conditional release, again pregnant with now 14-year-old's second daughter, Mary Kay, received 7 1/2 years in prison for numerous trial offenses. A prophetic editorial about the sad affair appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two miserable hours, LeTourneau was sent to jail, and this juicy blend of television seamlessness was over until the casting began." <br /> <br /> Sure enough, 18 months later, filming of this travesty is underway.
