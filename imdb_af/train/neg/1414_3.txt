After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which it compared to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I could see the judges right away. <br /> <br /> This movie was a poor attempt to have a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of the movie is almost identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. "10 items" rush the viewer through the 1-day timeline of the movie, while the better-planted "Lost In ..." extends over a few long days. <br /> <br /> I'm "I'm sure some people will see it because it has Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. It seems she is supporting better roles now and again in big blockbusters, rather than playing role-players in sub-$ 10 million release films and indie films.
