I only rented Creep and was not impressed at all. I didn't feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because the gore was only shocking. <br /> <br /> I left my living room several times, and there was something going on with this movie. Haven't we seen it before? I didn't like any characters like the man in the sewerage cage. I feel bad for him. But then I couldn't think again why he was still alive and not killed by the Creep? So many questions have to be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill, and I can see similarities vaguely. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not a good one. judge for yourself.
