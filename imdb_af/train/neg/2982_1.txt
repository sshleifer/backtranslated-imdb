Zombie Review # 3 <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Few movies are so bad they are good, and Zombi 3 is not only bad, it is carelessly bad so many ways that a whole new language may be needed to just describe them <br /> <br /> More than that, it is a film credited to Lucio Fulci, that even according to his standards absolutely no coherence, sense or have reason. However, we cannot blame Fulci, as it is not really directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have Fulci's sense of style to help carry the film. Mattei brought little to the film, but staggering ineptitude. <br /> <br /> So I'm ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features - known in a genre For thin characters, poor storyline and lack of filmmaking, Zombi 3 pushes the boat out, but it's even more fun than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The "action" begins when the "Death 1" Gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it and why did the US military think that creating cannibalistic legions of living death would be a good idea? All these questions and more will not be answered in Zombi 3. <br /> <br /> After hiding at a hotel, the infected thief gets angry with all the green plastic that grows on his face before being traced. by the army who foolishly sells the best way to sell his body, to burn it, send "Death 1" into the atmosphere leading to ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombie people !!! (As zombies are cannibals, why do the zombie birds only attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> We meet our "heroes", a trio of horny GIs and a coach girls. There are also a few other guys together, but they're not important - NO one is important here. You will be hard pressed to remember someone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to care for them. They end up hiding at the same hotel as the thief (a week ago this place was crying with life, now it's so with flies!)) But there's no escape from the dead. <br /> <br /> At this point you will either be completely sucked in or you will distort the damn thing. The writing is so frightening, even the biggest acting in the world can't save it, so it's just as good that they have the worst - and not just the human characters, but the zombie play here is a long time ago. low. There is no consistency in how the zombies behave - some fall in the glory of time, others are full of fist battles or machette control, not to mention the zombies that can still speak (a gymnast who gives the film REMOVAL FROM TWO END). They die from shots to the chest (rather than the head) and are even knocked out by a good left thigh. How can you shoot a zombie? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on bad 80 action often does it like an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> The zombies also spend a lot of time, seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance that some poor juice will pass away and get the fright of their lives. They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in the water, and even among pregnant women. At one point, a zombie follows a woman on the stairs. To kill and eat her? No! To push her into the water, the zombies and their crazy sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There are many gore though. Members are hacked, wounds cause green pussy and a lot of meat is eaten, and people get their faces in the mouth. There is nothing that fits the original eyeball piercing, but if bad makeup effects are your pocket, you won't be allowed. down. <br /> <br /> All this and I didn't even mention the terrible music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose play actually manifests itself as VERY bad, or the final chilling punchline ... In an ingenious twist on the original radio station overrun by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us a real zombie DJ !! "He's over to their side!" our escaping hero's cry, before we try to continue to fight the dead in a successor who unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is rubbish - it will be no loss to the world if every single press is destroyed and all records of its existence are erased, but somehow I feel my life is richer because I saw it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I mean 88 minutes shorter ...
