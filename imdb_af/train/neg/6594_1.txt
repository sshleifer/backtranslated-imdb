I saw the most, if not all, of the Laurel & Hardy classic movies. I've always been stupid, even after I have looked over and over. This new movie aims to bring the classic back with two new actors who look like Laurel & Hardy, but fail for various reasons. One is how their clothes are separated (early in the 20th century), but are both depicted in the 90s. Some of the previous dialogue was brought back, but it also fails to get close to the classic series. This movie may well be the worst movie I have ever seen and must be pulled out of the shelf forever. The true Laurel & Hardy is turning into such a bad imitation in their graves.
