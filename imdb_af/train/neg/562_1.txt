I like musical, but as a Dickens fan I hate this one. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Employing boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workplace? The poor of London come out to sing? Fagin and Dodger run off in the sunset? Not exactly true to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged in public and Fagin went to jail. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak like Sykes, and does a little more than growling to indicate his evil. The worst, however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often gets so uncomfortable and passive, wondering if he really is the main character. His portrayal is by no means helped by the fact that the best they can do when singing is in the voice of a girl. Guess they didn't realize boys could be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Self-respecting Dickens fans: stick to David Lean's incredible 1948 movie or BBC 6-hour mid-80s adaptation. Avoid this bloated white of a musical.
