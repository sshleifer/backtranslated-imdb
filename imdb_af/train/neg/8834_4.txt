There was a truth to this movie. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago by 4 fishermen who found a body in the water and they chose not to report it until they had finished. I also remember being accused of interfering with a body (or such a charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. The viewers outside Australia should think we live in a country full of rapists and serial killings. Wolf Creek and this movie will encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of a simple plan. But as far as one of the best Australian movies ever, as someone claimed, I can't be so generous. Put it that way, I won't bother it again.
