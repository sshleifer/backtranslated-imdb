Before the release of George Romero's genre definition Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table manners in the old days. But, social labels have excluded the excitement that these early zombies offer to the film? Judgment on this movie, not at all. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, with the aim of finding and destroying the mystery of zombie fermentation. One of the parties is discovering the secrets on its own and about building its zombie army. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But since it's a 30-year-old movie, these zombies are more like somamambulists than the carnivorous variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mental control rather than insatiable appetite. And frankly, the 'uprising' is also a bit of an understatement. The whole thing is really boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there is no over-the-top melodramatic theatrical to entertain us. It seems unlikely that it could offer much entertainment even 70 years ago. See it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I would recommend switching this one.
