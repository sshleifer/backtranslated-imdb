Do you like getting up? Keep away from this ... <br /> <br /> In the early round there are really good comics, but if they don't have nice features, they have a snowball chance. Any controversial material and you're out! ... and I think I injured as much as the away comedians when I saw who came in the crooked judges. <br /> <br /> 1 from my top 4 made it beyond the forerunners. Half + of the finalists laughed at me 0. Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges do not experience problems with. <br /> <br /> It is more entertaining than many who are still on TV, but incredibly difficult to watch without thinking what it might have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers change the name of the game to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism would be lost. Maybe an idea?
