This woman, who works as an intern for a photographer, goes home and takes a bath to discover this hole in the ceiling. So she is going to find out that her neighbor is a photographer over her. This movie could have had a good plot, but the plot drains from any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone sniffs heroin. If they pulled out the scenes where someone is churning heroin, then it would be a good movie. Every time I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have so much drug use in one movie. It attracted attention from the main plot and a wonderful story about a photographer. The lesbian things didn't bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I got a movie about drug use.
