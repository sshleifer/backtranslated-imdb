Bullfighter was made in 2000, but released for video for some reason 5 years later. I wonder why? Could it be: the confusing story, the incomprehensible dialogue that Oliver Martinez said, and the annoying editing? It must be. I think the plot was Maria (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) went on a mystical road trip. They meet many wacky characters and avoid evil evil people as well. The movie looks good and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when they try to be subtle, don't pay attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments and poor special effects. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is there for 2 minutes at most.
