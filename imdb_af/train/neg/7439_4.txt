Another looks at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films are interesting. But from my American perspective, this movie was just not that good. The protagonist, Marie who played Anastasia Hille, was not a pleasant character and I had a difficult time identifying with her. Most of the time, she was unpleasant and confused for many of the time left. There was also too much time spent bringing her to the main place of the film. Then a long time passed before any real tension was built up. Once that happened, volume appears to be used as the main effect that was more irritating than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make a thin plot. All in all, I would recommend renting it, but not for theater goers.
