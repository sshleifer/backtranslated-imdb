"The Man In The Attic" is a film that took place in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, this is a story that didn't really have to tell. <br /> <br /> Watching the box, the people responsible for packing the movie, have tried their best to make this movie look radiant and erotic. They use terms such as "illegal passion", "forbidden relationship" and "unlimited pleasure". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun! <br /> <br /> The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unfortunately married to a man who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The so-called "shocking" part of the movie is this: Krista's husband finds out the case and forbids them from seeing each other again. So, what do they decide to do? Krista ends that Edward lives on their attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward becomes extremely jealous. So on, and so forth. <br /> <br /> The man in the attic doesn't cover a new area. This is an original picture explaining why the stars are a few B-list actors and both appear briefly in the buffalo. <br /> <br />
