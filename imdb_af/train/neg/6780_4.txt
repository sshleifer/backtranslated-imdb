This film was a critical and box office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that later changed into a play. The story is about a number of naval officers on leave in San Francisco during World War II. They have 4 days leave they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The movie meanders a lot and none of the characters really look very much. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays a kind of wheel dealer and he doesn't really pull it off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn initially had to play against Grant, but had other obligations - so Suzy Parker packed up. She has never acted, but was America's top photographic model at the time. I think she did a good job considering all the pressure she was under. Grant's link with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes - didn't really work. The Studio tried to give her a little class by acting with Grant - but the character had nothing at all.
