Not that I don't like children's movies, but it was a tearjerker with few redeeming features. MJ Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly funny, but doesn't get the chance in this movie. It is sugar-coated sugar and will be almost 7 years old. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 10/03
