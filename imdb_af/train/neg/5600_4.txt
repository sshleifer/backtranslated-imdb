fulci experiments with sci fi and failure. Usually in his non-horror films we still get very good, but not here. Summarize many funny scenes such as when the prisoners are forced to hold a bar for 12 minutes, and when they fall, they are prosecuted. the man falls and lies on the floor for about two minutes, until his friends who are struggling to hold on, lift him from the floor anyway. The city is a clear model, but not a bad one. and the end blast is at its best. And don't start me on the terrible battle tones. <br /> <br /> 4/10
