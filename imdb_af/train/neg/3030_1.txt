Repetitive music, annoying narrative, terrible cinematography effects. Half of the plot was centered around shock value and the other half aimed at attacking the kind of crowd that would get stuck on people to fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in the "Deleted Scenes" section, one in which she was in her mother's head office. I don't understand why they want to cut it. The movie was desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino who talked about tournaments would have been a highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous camera work reminiscent of MTV, and totally unnecessary or useful for a movie. To expedite the movie just by passing a lot of things and turning the camera around, for the first time, it was the first time it was used. It's as if the directors want to use all these extra images they don't want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? It must have told me not to give it away from the preview. <br /> <br /> A popular movie for the "in" crowd.
