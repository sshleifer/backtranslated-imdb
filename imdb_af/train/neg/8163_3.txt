I agree with everything that people said on this one, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WORST I have heard all my life! There are real fever during times when you have to listen to the actor talk! And the choir is like a Broadway version of Danzig singing, "The darkness of the forest! Oh, the darkness of the dark, dark forest!" or something else so dissatisfied. The singer has a terrific vibrato and is recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthetic string divisions and fake drums. It's awful !! <br /> <br /> Yes, the male lead is terrible. So are the women too. This is a bad case of gender stereotyping - it's so bad! Everything they say turns out to be a man or woman, and only plays the stereotypes to the maximum. Make me sick. So boring! <br /> <br /> The kids were so echoey in their lines, you couldn't understand them. And why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair, nice blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean cut snails with cute shiny blond hair? Not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was far too spotless and clean to be a man living in a cave. Nice beard and bang, dad. Did you cut the people yourself with a knife or did you go to town and go to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
