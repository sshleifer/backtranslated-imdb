It's probably one of the worst giant killer animal movies I've ever seen. This follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment that went wrong and escaped a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical. The monster looks very much like a dinosaur, with large Tyranosaurus-like hind legs, when it looks like an excess of crocodile. Everything about this movie is original and it continually pushes "cliche", minute to minute. Why is there always two drunk redneck hunters after dark who divorce? Plus, there is always a guy and girl who share a cripple, obvious love interest while in life-threatening situations. Too much has already been said by me and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing it ...
