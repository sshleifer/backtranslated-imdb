This is simply the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from 2+ hours, and the goat art was completely misleading. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be a poor man's 300. You know, to laugh and make fun. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, just pain. Then the movie starts, and they speak some language. We think, "Oh, it's just the beginning." But no, from there the movie rolls out and it becomes more like a very boring book that you had to read in primary school, after which nothing literally happened. The battle scene thinks that of 2 kids fighting in a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this film belongs to the rubbish maker. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which was a good movie by the way.
