I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I have to say I wasn't satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were great, but the story line needed some touch. I also think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well as if it was rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> It will definitely attract more people to see it -> teenagers. What would also attract more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be a great closeup of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Although the movie has the points, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
