I don't see how anyone who even likes Van Damne can like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts with a few promises. I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie are excellent. The action scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a good start and is good lead to the main story. However, the film is quite hilly from there. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director could stay with the original premise. It is that the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time has come that the brother who has never picked up a gun is a good shooter and the brother who did not teach any martial arts is suddenly doing the split and high kicks. <br /> <br /> The plot, action, etc. is not ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne confronts an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of shooting and shooting at Van Damne, he does a war cry, as he carries a warrior, and runs to him. Van Damne continues to take a gun from a fallen soldier and shoot him ... while he is about 75 to 80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing ends. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. Instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo throws barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise. If you're a Van Damne fan, save your time and see Hard Target or one of its previous movies.
