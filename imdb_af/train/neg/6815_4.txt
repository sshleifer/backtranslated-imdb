The eight Jean Rollin movies I watched are also perhaps the strangest; the intriguing plot (as it is) initially seems to be angry to maintain even its pruning 84 minutes, but it somehow strives to make it uncomfortable as it goes! A female-female vampire (promised by the title) is held in captivity in a remote castle and only appears to celebrate the blood of willing victims (who are allegedly members of a suicide club). uncertain where it all will lead, does the author director eventually have the human villain ?? actually the blank-confronted hero's kinky dad? ridiculously revealed as a mutant (?!) of the future! The cunning pace and dreamy atmosphere (the cults carry hats and animal masks to hide their traits from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film maker (the seashore of the {anti} climax) and the "Euro-Cult" - style, as well as the glamor of nubile beauty. Personally, the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually inaccessible case was to see the famous character actor Bernard Musson (who is in six latter Luis Bunuel films the latter) from time to time relentlessly watching!
