I was fortunate enough to see a chorus when it came to my city. I was younger than .. but it was an excellent game. so would someone please tell me why in heaven's name they had to make a movie .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He didn't play the role. This movie sucked VERY time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is not to rent this movie. Save your money for something better like "Cats" ....
