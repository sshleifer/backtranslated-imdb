The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them because of the exaggerated, shaky camera work and the fast, confusing cut. I'm not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are proven right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh with most of their movies, but in this case there was too much. It seems as if the jets and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico City and every major scene were there to distract you from the realization that the story was pretty thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily find out how the whole thing will end. For a movie pretending to be violent, relentless and morally corrupt, it is inexcusable that his story has been told so many times and with much more depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to see a top action, I don't need any justification, but this movie was trying to justify the deadly spree of Denzel Washington's character and failed poorly to deliver any credible performances. For the first half or so, nothing happens, except that silly archetypes and clips are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling, it is cut so quickly that you don't know what really happens. The film does not work on the level of a credible drama or thriller, nor as a pure action movie. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the overall striking blockbusters of the past year, but I absolutely don't understand why so many people claim that this movie is something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is too long and for a movie it is too little.
