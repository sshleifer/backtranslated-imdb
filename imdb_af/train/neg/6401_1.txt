Can I do this until I need glasses? at least prove the point that someone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The people who unleashed this misery brought regret, without a glimpse of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should be the recent labs and babies playing with their own feces. Anyone else would be too wise to even get a snicker from this movie. It consists of a series of sophmoric sketches in which the punchline does not even look out. It ends with the ridiculous. The jokes that are being told are the kind of jokes that primary school children tell (usually potty or sexually related) where they don't know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like one about dad's car and mom's garage. Applying a sterner method of criticism would be senseless, as the normal standards of acting, writing, direction and so on have never been heard from the creative "thoughts". behind this mess. Not judgmental, but anyone who enjoys this film must seriously reflect on their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
