Sorry, neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy have anything to say that was worth saying. This movie is just dull. <br /> <br /> Children's movie? Well, if you try to get them to take a nap, then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of a few eye-catching animals to quip animations that aren't funny. And the lip sync makes the old Godzilla movies look brilliant. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy drones up with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently he tries to change his old manic persona, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original version of 1967 is lost in this remake, or whatever. A village wants some forest bully and guilty of doing bad things. No really. And Pluto Nash can do with their soul babbling. Things chain along with some old jokes to a boring, uninspired lock without surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the '67 movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
