The soul of an old mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he can punish everyone involved in the desecration of his grave. The soul transmission makes the young man at a tremendous pace until he looks like a mummy himself. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the digging. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is quite the thin affair. While the movie has some good, original ideas (bloodthirsty diseases, soul transmission, interesting makeup effects, the poor ripping scene, etc.) and some atmospheric moments, the direction is and fits the definition of plowing. To make matters worse, the first 15 of the movie's relatively short 66-minute runtime consists of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for this slow moving mummy flip, but Pharaoh's Curse even tests my patients. The throw helps very little. With just one exception (Ziva Rodann is that lonely bright spot? Wish the movie could be more focused on her mysterious character), that role is as dull as the script. Eventually I don't know whose idea it was to place the mummy-blowing servant in what seems to be pajamas, but it's a ridiculous, ridiculous look at a creature that is supposed to fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments about Pharaoh's curse, I'm going to rate it a 4/10. Not a good score to be sure, but generously given all the problems I have with the movie.
