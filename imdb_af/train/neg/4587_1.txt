Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> "What the Bleep We Know" has achieved almost impossible - behind such masterpieces of genre such as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin", and fourth, it goes into the history as the single worst movie I've ever seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive because I have seen a lot of a bad movie. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of the modern theater consists of two interwoven parts that alternate between a stupid and confronted plot about an extremely annoying photographer, left by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and a lot of conversation heads are about how quantum physics is supposed to justify their new-like pseudo-philosophy. Actually, if you start your day, meditate like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a substantial portion of good weeds, then this movie is for you as well. Otherwise, stay away. Take my word for it. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about "What the Bleep Do You Know" is that it seems to have been edited and compiled by the same kind of people shooting cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer generated sparks across the screen, and other associated cowardice. Whoever leaves these people anywhere near a theater release is a mystery to me. I think that's what too much Kenny G does to you. The movie is drenched with a cheesy GCI, like you or I can produce on our own computer via the exaggerated video editing software, but never because it's just too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The Writing is written by someone without any writing experience. Not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and confronted, but the "authors" felt that they had to move every relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, most of which went to this movie, completely off your throat. Well, given the target audience, it might not be too bad of an idea. For example, the main character spends half of the movie dolls. Apparently, this is not enough convincing, so there are at least some dialogues throughout, specifically referring to her anti-angels, only if viewers could not link her pierced pain and suffering to her. small white pills she takes when she feels. Acting ... Well, I did better in Ed Wood movies, and no, it's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little play in which I was 12, had much more inspirational acting than that. It really did. <br /> <br /> The story is interrupted here and there with a bunch of random spokes, a weird mix of boiling scientists, kooky doctors and self-declared mystics, continuing on and about how quantum physics presumably gives an explanation for how husband or wife created their own reality, just by participating in the experience of life. Reality, you see, is a field of probability of a lot of different possibilities, and is first put in stone if you chose the Observer to notice it. What happens if more than one observer is observing, they have not said, but again who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, notice, and you will be God, and no one condemns such stupid and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. All reason is immediately dismissed if people stay in their ways and are unable to make a "paradigm shift" and "go down the king's hat". Furthermore, the Heidelberg principle of uncertainty is presumably positive from alternative realities, parallel universes and the like. <br /> <br /> Speaking of kingdoms, the analogy penetrates the movie. All these people are still talking about going down to the king. I'm not sure what it has to do with anything else they say or show, but one thing I'm sure is that it involves some anal sex. Actually, the movie is _extremely_ anti-sex. Throughout, sex is offered as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the headers speak, the main character gets harmony and relief by painting hearts over her body with a magical marker, and continues to walk with an even stupider look in her ear. the eyes are glazed as she began. <br /> <br /> I want to return 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are some random quotes I remembered: <br /> <br /> "What I saw as unreal became much more real to me, and what I really thought was is often far less real than the unreal. "- Some talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does one man have to have an erection? It just takes one thought. Nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are inside. And yet he has an erection." Some self-proclaimed mystic, head of her own school of relief. <br /> <br /> [looking at the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you! fat! you're ugly! I have you! - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
