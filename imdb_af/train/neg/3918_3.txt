This movie may have been the biggest lapse I experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. Overall, I just found it to be a second movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is definitely acceptable as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character with cheerful skill. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (face hair) is so ominously ominous that I couldn't take him seriously. He looks like an overweight teenager dressed for Halloween, complete with the $ 4.95 sticky beard. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so-so, though the "dead" in the basement were pretty good. The tree language looks like something from a bad 1950's movie, though the tongue's POV shots look closer to Sam Raimi's brand shots in the recent "Evil Dead" trilogy. The piracy was haughty and the last battle is about as dull as you can get. (In fact, it reminded me most of the episode "Lost in Space" where the Robinsons are trapped in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> The plot was not very original and is countless tell times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no tension and no plot. In fact, you know right away as you are familiar with the characters that are good, who is bad, and who is going to survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then I sat down writing this review. The very first thing I did was the production date. Yes, it says 1987 ... not the 1967 I thought it might be. And it summarily summarizes: The production values ​​and FX are typical of the 1960s. The plot and action look much older, as Hollywood actually produces interesting and challenging films in the 60's. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
