I'm not a big Freddy Krueger fan, but that doesn't mean that I don't like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does. But, Roberto, this movie sucks. The play is terrible, the plot is very poor, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the role that even worth watching. Sometimes successors may be better than the first, like Friday's 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But that's not one of those movies. The original was good, the 2nd was in my opinion better, the 3rd was ok, but I didn't see the other. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I made by looking at this piece of shit.
