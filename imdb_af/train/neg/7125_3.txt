VILLA RIDES (1968) seems to be a big disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with Robert Towne, it still seems to be an empty written film directed by the pristine Buzz Kulik. First, the best billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one note show is missing and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have played a role. Brynner looks like a Russian aristocrat like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, second billed Robert Mitchum is completely wasted in the picture! She shares as a bisexual flying bait that launches homemade bombs of the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written slender role that could be played by any minor. Mitch doesn't have a decent line in the whole movie and also has his other Mexican revolution picture, the much better "Bandido" (1956), unfortunately no one interested in releasing it on DVD. Except for any style, "Villa Rides", it also suffers bad without the presence of a female star! There is asterisk Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the gift, but her casting is simply perfunctories. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters might have added some bad notes to the fake story line. <br /> <br /> There are some good action scenes in the movie, but some good action scenes don't do a movie maker and the less than perfect Panavision image quality plus the repetitive Maurice Jarre tone doesn't help . <br /> <br /> As Paramount's used to, there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and had been much better.
