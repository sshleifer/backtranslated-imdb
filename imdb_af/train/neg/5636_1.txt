This movie was the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It doesn't seem like a plot, but the time you realize it is far from the start of the movie, so you have to watch the closed for a long time to eliminate the total incompetence to recognize the director, also the sloth playing the tamponics in the movie, and we do not believe the Willem Dafoe in this movie, he is a clone because the real Dafoe, as we know of "apocalypse now" and "the doctors saints, "would never agree with such a manuscript. <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da) enemy wrote this account with his twenty years little baby. This film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the two authors, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (the story); Wife meets husband, old male widow, widow breaks windscreen with the man who blows her. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; The black widow (different title, same bullshit). <br /> <br /> DO NOT DO THIS MOVIE WEEK !!! This is a total time !!!
