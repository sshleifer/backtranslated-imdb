The first half or so of this movie I liked. The obvious emerging romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable events between them. However, if the action switched to Ingrid's fiance's home, it fell completely apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some rude dopey parallel characters appearing to destroy the movie. The fiancé's drunken boy and military attaché's endeavor for the girl's attention seems dumb - like a subplot of an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give you obsession is beyond me. This film is an obvious effort by Renoir to regain the success he had with the rules of the game, as the movie is very similar to the action switching to the estate (just like the other movie). I wasn't a big fan of the game's rules, but ELENA AND HER MEN appreciated the artwork and nuances of the original movie.
