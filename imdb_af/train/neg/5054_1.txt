We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idea that some will challenge. Friends and relatives of this and others who have died in the attacks on the World Trade Center may be able to change this vapid play movie. A sweet, serious, though the tongue-bound fireman reminds of what he can do from lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who has transformed his fragments. They think of the results. He mumbles even more, she composes another promise, etc., Etc. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that caused the need for a thousand eulogies are overwhelmingly sad, but this turbulent dramatization is disturbingly boring.
