As a former teacher (!) I must confess to cringing through many scenes - "though I keep looking at the end. I wonder why ?! (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The initial opening scenes made me so incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed, but the plot, although there were some good ideas, for example, the situation of a relief teacher, was not concentrated enough in any direction for 3-D development. <br /> <br /> None of Mr Nolte's finer moments, as far as Macchio is concerned, he speaks in every * movie? <br /> <br /> Aside from acting and acting, the hair styles alone was a nostalgic journey. <br /> <br />
