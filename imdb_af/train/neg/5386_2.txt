While I am one of the "stars" of this movie, don't necessarily give me insight, I know quite a bit about the first thing there ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of "incoming warrior" and very happy. It was funny, sexy, messy, all the key requirements of an entry movie. you have to remember it's shot and released before the rest ... animal house, porky's, etc ... so in its own way this movie was really ahead of its time. For whatever reason, the film was given to the main distributors who worked out half of the original movie, and then (if I shuffled?) The most random scenes ever changed. the fat man, the people with goat heads ... how totally it was? I'm sure it's been supplemented for additional T&A, but it was so slow, it caused anything to be done before it sharpened to a scary and painful halt. but everything is a fun memory for me ... especially since I can say the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in!
