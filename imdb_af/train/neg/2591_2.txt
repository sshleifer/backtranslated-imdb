To begin with, I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Even though the naked mile and the one are the worst, it seems to be the downfall of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First, the best part of the movie was that it is an American Pie movie, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> There are tons of bad things to say about this movie. First, the story has a very old 'arch' structure. Firstly, there is the launch of the characters, then the promise of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each one has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general stall of the plot, there is little or no character development, which makes a double shaky of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, I didn't like the stereotyping in this movie. This is to show the jocks as the extremely cool, just-thinking-over-sex guys, and the geeks explicitly appear as inferior. It also only shows women as sexual objects, and men who only want to treat women as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, a generally horrible movie, if viewed from a critical point of view. Seen from a teenager's point of view, I think it's better, but this movie is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.
