In a distant galaxy is a planet called Ceta. These are native people worshiping cats. But the dogs war against these cats loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people for food. It's one of the stupid ideas for a movie I've seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he made in previous films. It's as if he enjoys playing in a celluloid game of Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are the viewer. Mr. Great and his foolish little steering heart actually has people who still buy this crap. <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment by Ted Mikels; The story behind making (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenes footage; Ted Mikel's filmography; and Trailers for "The Worm Eaters", "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (with Nudity), "Blood Orgy of the Devils" and "The Corpse Grinders"
