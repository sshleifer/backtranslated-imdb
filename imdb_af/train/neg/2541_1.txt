I never saw the original movie in the series. I just hope it was a much better movie than this or the successor made in the 1980s, as if it were not just how these two terrible persecutors were justified. This movie had a very good lead when they showed it to an old, independent station that now shows it from the past. Anyway, it seemed to be a pretty good and scary movie. However, it was a movie that made some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only true observation is near the end when you see the shape during a very heavy rainstorm, otherwise there is virtually no sign of the creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is basically the old evil hunters have to kill anything they see and are after the bushy lobster and the kids are out to help it or just a random furry man in the bush who likes to random boats by the water. pull. Not really worth watching, but I would like to see the original, and its creator will also make the bad guys of the 80's, but he also has a very good treasure in the 70's "The Town the Dreaded Sundown " made.
