!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think a story involving Archie Gray Owl - an English-based red-eye - would have a massive amount of humor involved. In fact, I say the only way to treat such a film, where a remarkable person harms the gullible public, is to treat it as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough commits something to a crime by making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he also made a terrifying movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the same wood Annie Gaupeau) has any kind of on-screen chemistry. But to be fair to the role they did not help with the writing that Arkie does not portray, it is a fiery captain that he believes everyone believes he is a native American. The manufacturers and scriptwriter made the big mistake of having the film center to the Archie plot as an English man. That's why I wrote "Possible spoiler," it is not announced until late in the film that the title character is. English, but it is clear that anyone who watched this movie knew that it was absolutely no surprise beforehand. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is beautiful and that it is deeply ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major environmental scientist of the 20th century to be told the truth. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and possibly the TWO TOWERS if you want to classify it as a green message) there is actually not a great ecological film. In fact, most environmental-conscious films suck and this includes GRAY OWL, a film that has been unobtrusively a serious problem with finding a distributor
