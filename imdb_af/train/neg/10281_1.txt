Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant, excessive mother moves in with her. JJ, excited about this variety, will entertain restaurant owner Alex, service provider, Alex, to entertain her mother in exchange for the "maybe" review of his dying restaurant. Alex falls predictably for the daughter as he warms to the mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2-dimensional. JJ is a self-preserving, hateful character, her mother superficial and level. JJ's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The underlying message of a 50-year-old woman who can't do it herself, without male help, is bad, bad, BAD. The play is once dull, the writing is uninspired. The movies that only save grace are the establishment of New York City. So I wouldn't recommend this movie.
