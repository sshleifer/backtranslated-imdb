I must say though this movie was formulable with a plot stolen from movies like Friday the 13th. I know what you did last Saturday. This movie wasn't that bad. In fact, it wasn't as bad as most of Hollywood's recent Horror movies. The murders, although sometimes a little too imaginative, were in most cases just as original. The film was mediocre, which can be expected from low budget features, but much better than the much larger studio Artisan / Lions Gate offers. My only true complaint that was not due to the film's budget, which should have been small, was the confronted "twist" end. I'm sorry, but that's what this movie is in the bad category for me. The end was just stupid and tackled. Before that I was a bit bored, but actually enjoy it. 10/04
