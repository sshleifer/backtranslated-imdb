Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some many graphics and ... well, yes, it's all about this movie. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no storyline. No sweet characters, well, 'characters' aren't right, as you don't have an idea of ​​who someone really is. I mean, they are being driven by a little strange thing in the sewers (who is this thing? Why is he there?), It's pretty scary, but do I really think? No, I don't. Why don't I? Because I don't have an idea of ​​who these people are and I don't know if I want them to live or die. It is one dimensional and relies on gore and sound effects to scare you, which rarely do. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning, any purpose. It feels like I've fallen asleep and missed the 45 minute build up. It jumps right into the action. Basically, some women and her friends in the London underground are locked, chased by strange creatures, and eventually escape. <br /> <br /> Crawling his moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are good, but it doesn't make a decent horror movie, so unfortunately everything is spilling. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another predictable modern 'horror', where Kate (the main character) is consistently the stupid 'hey, I know you are sitting at home a lot, I think should do the sensible thing in this situation, but oooh no! to do because I'm a stupid blonde "thing. I wish they would not, it was done so many times, it was boring and predictable. In fact, I'm pretty annoyed. The foolish woman did not sting through the sleeve, gray, alien creatures. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is the film strip. Well, Cruise ends just a short while in the movie. If you had a few beers, have a few friends back with you, then you should watch it. But if you want something original and clever, avoid it.
