First, I want to point out that Sam Niel can not be seen anywhere in this film. What a movie without Sam Niel? Have seen anyone Event Horizon. D wars may have a dragon movie that controls lizards with rocket rivals, but unfortunately it is not. No, no Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking the $ 5 to rent D-Wars and adding 10 to the five and buying a Sam Niel movie. It's clear to submit it. I need to have ten lines of text so I can recommend a list of Sam Niel movies. <br /> <br /> - Jurassic park death calm-hunt for red October-eve-no jurassic park three <br /> <br /> overall D-Wars is a hope
