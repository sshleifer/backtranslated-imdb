When this film was released in 1997, the "special effects", like them, were poor. They would even be dated for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no one involved in the production of this movie was looking for an Oscar. This is a wild departure from director Fred Olen Ray's usual stuff, most of which is the word "Bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls of the Lost Planet, etc.) and little more than T & amp; A flicks, but here we evaluated with a movie, "You" and aimed at the kiddies squarely. You need to give him credit for diversification! It was a small direct-to-video cult hit that later led to a few persecutions - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career quickly declined after the 1982 century) plays the "invisible mom" of the movie title and will return for the successor. Russ Tamblyn (whose career has been even more free-fall "West Side Story" since 1961) plays the villainous dr. Woorter. It is probably fair to say that most of the role players were about to be in their careers where they would be willing to work almost anything to pay the bills that month - except perhaps young Trenton Knight like Josh. It is rather to say that although he worked for this movie, this child actor did not work again for the successor, "Invisible Mom 2". Maybe the movie was cursed. After all, he wasn't that bad. This movie. For a child actor, he is pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-workers. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the "invisibility" effects are the least to say, The direction is poor, the writing is obvious and nothing else to write about the house. There are many films out there, and for anyone under the age of ten, this movie will undoubtedly be quite viewable. Most adults will probably do a vanishing act of their own while it's up, and I won't blame them once!
