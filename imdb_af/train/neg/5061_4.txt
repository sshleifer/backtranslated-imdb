Anurag Basu who made the flop KOPCH TO HAI made his debut in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was in a way before that, though it has a story that's no different and it came closest to HAWAS released 1 week before and fortunately it was better and did a better business <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, Malika's debt is well shown at the beginning although the scene with Emran-Malika is too rough / vulgar <br /> <br /> The screens between Emran and Malika is well handled and the turn in the story confronting Ashmith Emraan is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The pace is moving fast and the viewer is kept on the edge, but the second girl from Emraan is not quite convincing. <br /> <br /> The police track also looks half-baked. <br /> <br /> The final is too filmy too. <br /> <br /> Direction by Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner, all songs were fantastic Camera work was stunning <br /> <br /> Emran played his naughty streak very well, it was the role who gave him death and although he continues to play such roles and becomes annoying in this movie. He was excellent. Ashmith was also good at his role. He did a good job and one of his only good performances and he looked good. Malika was brilliant in her role in the second half, but Her wheel delivery was sometimes not to the point. Rarely did she show such potential in other films. Raj Jhutsi is good
