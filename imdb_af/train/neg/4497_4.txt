- I planned to write something that explains what I don't like this movie, but it will be harder than I thought. Honestly I can't remember much of it. I only watched it three days ago and it made almost no impression on me. This is usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of a Humphrey Bogart watch-like detective has really turned away quickly. It will be different if he can act, but he is a one-note entertainer. The screens were handled amateurishly and there was no tension leading to them. If you can't see the killer five minutes in the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The decision is giving away a dead to the killer's identity.
