The reason why it is such a bad movie is because it is so badly written, and it is entirely the fault of hack writer Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges or Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is quite thin and the dialogue is wood and indescribable. A failed couple? " A blockbuster American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history she's ashamed of? Thrown up by a strong, self-directed criminal and after a few adventures (mostly violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the ruthless partner for the murderer, who is worse than him, sees her more clearly than anyone had before. Nothing can help pass this movie, not even the faces of Scott Glenn as the murderer, not the attractive Latin of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and not even the solid performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA Specialist on the killer not find. A serious waste of time.
