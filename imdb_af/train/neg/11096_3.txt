I had high hopes for this movie because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely awesome, the most philosophical low-budget movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is completely useless and flat. Scene after play seems random in the mix, without much thought for narration or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape to be a prostitute or not? Hard to tell. Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape life? Why doesn't she pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her hair in the same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The filmmaker doesn't seem to know. <br /> <br /> Everything feels like being improvised (though I understand this was not the case) and the filmmakers just kept a camera as if they were a distant documentary. <br /> <br /> After the show I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning cinema as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was a cop-out. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that the movie maker would continue to make such a thrill as CLEAN, SHAVEN to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with difficulty. old "political" cliches.
