Although I never want to be the kind of person who ignores another's personal taste; if you want something, it's good. But this movie was horrible and there was no way it was. I don't like much of Ani Difranco, but she is a great guitarist and songwriter, whom I can recognize. But I can't admit there are any redeeming features for this movie. Many people know this is an accurate portrayal of the problems faced by high school students. Perhaps, but everything is too far-fetched. There seems to be an attempt to be a "Naked Gun" - a kind of comedy, but the timing is off; there was too much space between each actor line, as if they were laughing at laughter (there wasn't any). Whoever wrote the script was everywhere in the place. They tried to put together so many controversial issues in one movie, almost never developed any of them (especially the girl fertilized by a teacher). I didn't even laugh through this whole movie. I was insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do something, but rolling my eyes on the screen.
