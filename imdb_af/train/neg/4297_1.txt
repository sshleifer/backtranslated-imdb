Suddenly, I was awake, aware that I was going to sleep on the plastic couch cover, and realized it was a hot Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all my grandmother's muscle relaxants? Can it begin to mature? <br /> <br /> No, I temporarily stopped on Cheap Seats while navigating the channel and the incredible lack of humor and talent threatened my vitality with such a speed that I became black. <br /> <br /> This is the head-shake, mouth-agape, shoulder-shoulder bad. But I have to give this moronic and boring twin credit for selling this idea. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN program manager they had on me, and when he woke up, there were some terrible episodes that were already in sight and he hoped that since all the viewers were going to sleep, no one will be how terrible it is and he / she can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You're warned.
