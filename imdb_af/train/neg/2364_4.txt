"Freddy's Dead" has the smartest thing it could have done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this "final" movie in the saga is stupid, but at least original. Some of the footage is even a bit breathtaking. And the story of Freddy's child (Lisa Zane) returning to town to meet her evil father is unique. <br /> Overall, the movie is nothing more than another cartoon made to get kids into the theater. It has a lot of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look silly and wander like sheep ready for the battle. It's one-sided, it's a magic, and in the end it's nothing but goofy, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
