Shiri Appleby is the cutest little personification of evil, has good girl, demonic kicking Buffy clone, Elle. But I come before myself, you see Lilith was the first woman made by God as a companion to Adam. But she had everything on the evil feminists so God banned her from Eden. A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her, but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not really as well explained). Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy clone who has to fight with a scientist who has been given an injection of Lilith's blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded annoying, it's because it's. The film is also boring, generic, and for a movie with a plot plagued in theology, it doesn't look like a lick about it. This bargain basement lousy-CGIed movie was apparently a failed series of pilots. All I can say about not picking it up is a sounding Amen. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comment by Author / Planner Bill Platt and co-author Chris Regina; and Stills gallery; video effects samples: before and after (it also has a "also available" selection you think would lead you to some trailers, but not on DVD cover for other movies, this is a stupid idea) <br / > <br /> DVD-ROM extras: Final script and extracted screens both write in PDF format
