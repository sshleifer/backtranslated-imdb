As for me, this quiet version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no softness or love or spirituality about this version, it is all macabre, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me that Nazis fell in love; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this one we learned John Gilbert and his brutal family member, the Prince, who played after this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, with a modern brave hairstyle and indisputable feminist way that has wiped me out time and again. I love my romance light and beautiful, with slow build-ups; not hard and sadistic like this one. And come, those bees stick lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> See a lively show of the show if you want a good idea of ​​the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar. If you don't, wait until TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier audio version. It's much better.
