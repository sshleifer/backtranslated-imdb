Following his long title, the movie finds ways to get close to the 90's. The beautiful sets are here with everything that made the Hamer production values ​​a brand, but Paris drowning is a sign of indolent neglect. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so that nothing comes unexpectedly and nothing more than 5% of your attention is expected. <br /> <br /> Directing is tough as a direct transfer of the play, actors are mostly stiff like wax figures (and it's a hammer feature, but sometimes it's better in the whole package). My conclusion: this movie is trash, not worth the time I spend that night. Everlasting life is a boring matter, and I had hoped the guys who were in control of programming at the Cinemathèque would have known better.
