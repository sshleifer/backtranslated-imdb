Effect (s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes it is not only possible, it is necessary. The Haunting was given the computing work thanks to a first-class movie-turner director who once promised (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a series of great budget coffee (Twister, Speed ​​2). <Br /> <br /> The actor is superfluous in such a movie and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as they wish they are everywhere, but in this movie. Lili Taylor makes an effort to add something to the proceedings, but whatever may be something is unknown as the writing feels half missing. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts appear with no rhythm or reasons and then the story ends only with an unsatisfactory non-event intended to awaken the previous 90 minutes of injustice. <br /> <br /> There is really no reason to see it for the consequences, as we all know that anything can now be put on the screen. Why not watch effects in the service of a good story rather than just for their own sake?
