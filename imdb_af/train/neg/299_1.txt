It was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ONLY TO YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one working and was a better movie. <br /> <br /> DARAR is directed by Abbas Mustan who, unfortunately, failed in their effort here <br /> <br /> The story was good, but the handling was not so good and the heroine was too regressive and the climax was also disappointing. <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi replays his role of YAARANA (strange as also a remake of SWTE) and looks too thick for the head and is good. Juhi is decent while Arbaaz is trying too hard. in his debut and in many scenes to chill the audiences, but his voice was terrible. Johny is too hard
