This movie was not only bad - it was terrible. After looking at it, I actually needed to take a CUSTOMER to get rid of the dirt. There is a "gag" with an elderly couple making up, it's not funny, but it's disgusting. The monster was cool, but that's all. The continuity errors alone will hurt you - at least I was. The editing is really poor. <br /> <br /> Almost everything you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in a bad movie, this one is exceptional in his dissatisfaction. I couldn't even laugh at that. You're warned.
