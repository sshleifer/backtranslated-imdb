I am currently debating whether or not I should end up watching this "poppycock" from a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the buried movie set, and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There are the burial mounds, some cloud-raising monstrous amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf, regardless of it. What I would have missed, if I had the good sense of throwing this nonsense, is a dune car hunt, a very bad C.G.I., an amazing stupid dialogue, more bad C.G.I., and the heroic inscription. Unlike the original idea, this film has absolutely no valuable features. My mistake to continue watching. - NOTE
