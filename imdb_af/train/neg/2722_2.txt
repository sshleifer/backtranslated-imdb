For the great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is a maddeningly incoherent film from France that gives so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is about a bitter old boyfriend, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), looking for a heart transplant in Tahiti, but besides, I have no idea who any of the people in the movie was or why they were doing not they did. With no coherent story to boast about, the movie is losing us early, although I am quite willing to admit that there are a few people out there who can actually get a deep message from this movie. <br /> <br /> This darkened dramatic drama runs two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of life is still hanging around at the closing credits.
