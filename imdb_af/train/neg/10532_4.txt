Madison is not bad - if you like simplistic, non-offensive, "family friendly" rates and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydraulic racing. If you grew up with the sport like you, your heroes have names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovakia, etc. Had. Prepare to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have long commented on the formal nature of the film and its fondness for using every hackneyed sports clich√© in the book. I don't have to repeat what they said. What I felt was unfortunately lacking was a sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydrides in the "glory years" (which many would argue had already passed in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was great to see The old classic boats brought six up to date, although it was clear that the restored versions (hats to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) Reduced speed is monitored by the screens. But where was the sound? Much of the excitement of the ancient hydros was the indignation of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft, to RPMs never suggested by their designers. They hit the starting line right in front of you. You didn't hear it, you made it wrong. Real hydro buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There is nothing in Madison. Instead, every racing scene is buried beneath what must be a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> And then there are the nearby shots of the drivers, who ride smoothly and comfortably in the cabin as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases they take time to smile as they think how the poorest hometown hero could be the best. Or, in a particularly ludicrous shot, take time to see Jake Lloyd giving a "rocky" salute to a bridge post. In fact, some unrestricted drivers wore wing jackets to reduce the beating they took while the boats hit the rocky water at speeds of over 150 mph. <br /> <br /> If one reviewer so appropriately: "The sport deserves it better." <br /> <br /> Finally, as another user performed anachronisms, I added one: the Seattle founding booth shows the Kingdome and Safeco field. Not existed in 1971
