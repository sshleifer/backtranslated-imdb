Poor Tobe Hopper. He runs an everyday horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then, everything he has done is terrible. It's probably the worst ... and it says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) flame ... or something. Almost an original idea (someone remembers 'Firestarter'?) This is a real mess ... literally ALL is wrong! Pathetic acting (even Dourif!), Asinine script, lower production values, crappy special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! A must miss ... not even good to laugh.
