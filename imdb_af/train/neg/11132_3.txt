A documentary, like any filmmaker, must convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe fail completely in this effort, throwing uninspired chunks of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is shot amateur and video. Pascoe's only attempt to put the fragments together as a whole is by regularly throwing a vague title on the screen: "9-11," "Activism," "Truth." <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> Compare it to documentaries such as "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War" that create a narrative drawing material from interviews, stock images and filmed material. In the end, each one delivers a pleasant and informative message thoroughly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only salvation of the movie is Chomsky's careless record of historical dogma and the fact that running time is just 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the more interesting parts was Chomsky's story of his experience with the National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating versus deviant views, while NPR's liberal dogma jackets carry his interrogators and dramatically limit his allowed messages. Another media exhibition to be skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary document is for Noam Chomsky finalists only.
