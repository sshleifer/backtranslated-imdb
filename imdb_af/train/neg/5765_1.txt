Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start with. The last movie was a mediocre effort. Place it next to this drawer, it's a comedy classic. While part two was filled with much dated humor and cheap shots, it was at least funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be funny, of course. Hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film allows for young imbeciles who will laugh at anything. When they provided the junior high school crowd, any sense of self-respect was thrown out of the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I've been watching them in comedies since 1998. They are so dated. Michael Jackson jokes is also not cool. What's worse, make fun of two pieces, "performers" whose best days were never. <br /> <br /> The death of the American cinema is a slow one. Movies like these are the nails that are thrown into the coffin. What happened to real humor? I laughed aloud in a kiosk for a long time. Too many bad movies ruin the brain. You want proof? Go to your local mega chain video rental shop and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe the hype. I'd rather see Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than to again suffer from this poor excuse for a comedy! Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
