DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie constantly shown on Sky Movies in Britain and seeing it look about three times a week for a whole year, I have absolutely no idea how I managed it until it's the first broadcast on the network no. television tonight. Actually, if I'm not much of a fan of horror movies, the reason is probably my theory that it's going to be. My theory has been proven for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved. For example, early in the movie, the bad guys fly Dracula's coffin from London to America (In a twin-engine turbo plug plane!) And one of the bad guys is left alone in the container where Dracula comes to life. A fight breaks out, there's a lot of noise, but the bad guys in the cabin don't hear a sound until the writing demands it. It also appears in this segment's climax that Dracula can control the weather, but it seems to have been forgotten about how the film progresses. Messy dissertations and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there are many characters characters at the New Orleans mardi grass, then the characters are in a different place like the police station in the next scene, then they are back at the mardi grass improved the scene that meant the lack of credibility in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is something else that has driven my chain - Product placement. There are seven scenes where the logo for a particular record label / dealer chain is in full view. I dare not announce the company's trademark (except to say that they also operate a train company that is a national joke in Britain), but I was under the impression that this kind of advertising was against British broadcasting service lines and I did the BBC surprised. this movie if that is the case <br /> <br /> There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 such as the footage. It's actually a nice movie with a nice visit and son, those vampires are hot, but that's something we should expect from Hollywood over the past few years. A very good movie that is very dumb.
