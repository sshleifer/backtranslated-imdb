We saw it on the shelf at the local video store, "Coppola" in the credits and got excited. It was the only time this movie had raised any interest. I can never really work out if it was an attempt at a humorous movie that failed, or an attempt at a serious movie that failed. Overall, the whole production looks incredibly amatuerish. The sound in particular was absolutely terrible, especially in the screens shot in the bar; The dialogue was so thin in parts, it was incredible. Very disappointing.
