And this is the only reason I own this DVD. Now I didn't see the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the information and I said here: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was male. But then the first one in the future, so maybe it's Alex a brand new one and the scientist just made Alex's wife this time. Who knows, it is by no means addressed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby (or whatever you want, as it was, is in the future) escaping with her mother using a special time ship and ending in the 80's Africa. There, mum is killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows in an African tribe. Then the tribe is slaughtered by a cyborg of the future and Alex then walks and hides and eventually kills the cyborg. So there. Terminator is not the only movie being torn down here, Predator also gets his fair share and I think the first Fly movie, the Vincent Price one, will be special. nomination to provide a solid foundation to build your cyborgs head. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Well, the movie was a very standard small budget slip, but it had bad special effects for a mid 90's movie. It would have looked good for an 80's flick how ever. Biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is hardly interested. Nemesis 2 is not the crappiest piece of cinema I liked (?) To watch, but it doesn't come close. <br /> <br /> I won't say anything about acting because let's be honest here: Has anyone expected Oscar worthy performances here? Oh well ... at least I found Sue Price hot in the Amazon fighter. <br /> <br /> A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many benefits over the entire quality. And despite the very basic plot, the film itself makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> A cam movie rating: 4/10 Occasionally, I laughed at the mere badness of the movie, so it has little merit in it.
