I simply can't believe the number of people comparing favorably with the first movie. It moved me to leave this comment! It's just an obvious attempt to subscribe to the success of the first movie. The story is ridiculous, the portrayal of the French police laughs and the characterization of Doyle is a mile away from the first film. </ P> <p> The story is ridiculous, and nothing like authentic or compelling as the original movie. <br /> <br /> How many drugs do you think go to the port separately to see a shipment coming? The ease with which Doyle finds his husband is just pathetic. Like all the French police just drink coffee until Doyle comes from America and some real police work. What a joke. Try to go to a strange city and escape the biggest cliffs in the place with a travel card and some tourist pamphlets. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A real terrible successor, anyone who thinks differently, is crazy.
