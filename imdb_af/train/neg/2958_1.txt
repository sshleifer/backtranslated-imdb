This movie was amazing. This is staggering. I regularly come with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find terrific movies to watch for their comical value. My friend suggested this one, but when we looked at it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just so I could say I had, but I couldn't. It's so bad. Horrible running gags, lame acting. The main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I will look at Costener's The Postman twelve times to see a break from this movie again. I think they are trying to deal with some dinosaur discrimination problems, but the part of the movie that really stands out is that the dinosaur is constantly knocking things with his tail and then throwing it over. It hurts. See if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise leave this alone.
