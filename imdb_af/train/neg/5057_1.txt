Very outdated movie with a horrible, clich√©-driven and mawkish dialogue and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk constantly dominate. A pseudo "good movie". It doesn't take time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total drill, filled with histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is terrible. Camera movements are without imagination, such as building characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. The actors are constantly smoking and we see advertisements for beer drinks. Very cheap, indeed. (one exception: Ned Beattie's beautiful and simple way to play the hit).
