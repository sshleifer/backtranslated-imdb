Calling a movie like "Thinner" is bad as calling around the earth or Pauly Shore not being talented. No news, but how it has been, is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie .... The book was good, even though it was a bit of a derivative of other stories of "be careful what you want" genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father (Constantine of TV's 222 room) for a few pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, does it start well, but why does the mobster (Mantegna) involve? Why do automatic weapons burn so much? Why does it change into something so strongly dependent on FX? I thought it would have been far more effective if it focused more on the subtle effects of weight loss, disease, death, gypsy lore and so on. <br /> <br /> But no, it's not to be. Remember, this is Stephen King we are talking about. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact, the whole movie speaks too much, because it must explain that each plot turns to us. Not that I expected the "Dead Zone", but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary". Thank goodness. <br /> <br /> One star to do at least halfway decent makeup. But the rest of the movie is about to be ... tell me ... "Thin".
