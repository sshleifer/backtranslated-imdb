Adjusting theater plays is often a bad idea because it is two different mediums. Do you think it's a good idea to make ZULU in a stage play? Imagine where two brave roosters sit in a tent. "Blimey there are thousands of them out there." Great movie and a bad play. <br /> <br /> Playing a stage to make a big movie requires two essentials. </ br /> <br /> 2) A good dialogue <br /> <br /> On paper, Cher and Chazz Palminterri will be a good choice, but not in these roles. The story revolves around a hit played by Palminterri, who broke into a house to kill a woman Cher played with most of the action in the house. I was unable to take these two characters seriously. Maybe it's the mistake of writing that can't decide if it was serious or funny. As the story is very static, it is of utmost importance that the dialogue shine and again, due to the bizarre tone of the script, it becomes more than anything else embarrassed by much of the conversation that revolves around sex acts. if you want to see a fantastic translation of a play that has been transferred to the silver screen, give it a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead.
