It's not my fault. My girlfriend showed me. <br /> <br /> There's nothing positive to say about this movie. There has been an idea for many years that Madonna can act, but she can't. There is an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a good director, but he's just middle-aged. An embarrassment around. <br /> <br />
