Painful. Painful is the only word to describe this horrible version of such a fun and interesting Shakespeare game. I gave it a shot, but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare it even. For the person who wrote a novel on how wonderful this turn of Much Ado was, I am sorry for you and your bored brain. May your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution. Please don't even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for performing Shakespeare's famous drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a chest of drawers near the television you are choosing because involuntary feces will occur.
