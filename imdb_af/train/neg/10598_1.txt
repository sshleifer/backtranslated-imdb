it is a piece s - t !! It looks worse than a tsv. Movie. and I shut down to think that a successor was even assigned and the results ... war is more beautiful than that. Jean Claude of Shame did it again and he is wondering why his career is where it is now. no writing, no story and no time should be wasted on this. I mean it. 1 out of 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg must be jackhammered for this. Shame is not an actor.
