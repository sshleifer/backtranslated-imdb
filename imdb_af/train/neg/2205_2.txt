This type of plot does have a lot of potential, but it is slaughtered here. Honestly, I felt the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birth. Wiea, I was wrong! Such a crazy scientist makes a monster, wants to boast of his old hosts before he kills them, but of course they escape. Then it is very bad. I had to count the times the rubber shark mask asked from behind the leaves, but I would probably have lost the score. <br /> <br /> Pan down to the blood-drop-off-cut bone to show us how the shark man finds the people. I hate every void of every horror movie. Nice, and after almost being killed by a mutant shark man and having an island in a jungle island, nothing more cheerful than a means. A man who keeps Shakespeare busy ... <br /> <br /> This is one where you will root yourself for the monster ... if you can carry to watch this poor excuse for a movie.
