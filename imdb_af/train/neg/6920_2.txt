Body Slam (1987) is a terrible movie. The low budget range, the direction is pedestrian (at its best) and the writing and acting are lame. But if you're old school wrestling (around the 1970s through the 80's), you'll be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. I gave it a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was "targeted" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The synopsis of this movie is about a promoter who wants to combine her. rock and wrestle. But they are others who don't want him to succeed. There's more but I don't want to flush it for you. If you can stomach the bad acting and boring story, there are a few surprises nearby the end for the hard wrestlers. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it to my worse enemy (and I mean it).
