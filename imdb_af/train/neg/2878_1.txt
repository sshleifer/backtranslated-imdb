Don't see this movie. Bad acting and stupid effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see very cool murders and hot chicks, but instead the director slaughtered animal slaughter videos to shock you, the safe. Disgusting. The murders are pretty lame, basically strangling. One woman he made worms in her mouth, one he placed raw hamburgers on her face and strangled her. BTK = BTK broiler, burger king's "killer" new sandwich .... ha ha. I don't think this movie relied too much on the real facts. I mean, his real BTK killer didn't keep a lot of rodents, scorpions and worms around. And oh ... a slaughtered cow head too. Go figure.
