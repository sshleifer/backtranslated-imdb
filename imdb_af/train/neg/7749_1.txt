This movie should never be made. From the poor form of animation, so far bad acting. I'm not sure at what point the people behind this movie said "Okay, look good! Let's do it!" I was upset at how terribly terrible this movie was. At one stage, which was probably the best point, the computer generated Saber's tooth of gold fell from the roof, stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth who was killed within minutes of his first appearance. The other two succeed in killing a handful of people before being burned. Then there is a random one waiting for victims in the jungle ... who scares me for one reason. Will there be a part two? God, for the sake of people everywhere, I hope not. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure garbage. End of power write off credits after slideshow ends.
