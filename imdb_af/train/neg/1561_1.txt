Anyone who has given these movie series reviews should see more movies. <br /> <br /> A loser takes his camera and photographs his spiritual family. The movie is full of idiots and contains lively "teabagging". It has to summarize everything for you. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Maybe you want to see the whole movie in the hope that it gets better as it goes on - don't!
