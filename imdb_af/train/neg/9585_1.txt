I remember watching this movie in 86 when it first came out and what a horrible movie. The scene was frightening. The plot was so thin it would or was to blow in a breath of wind. I think it made me sleep more than one occasion and I was not tired of remembering. Please avoid at all costs, even better, all your teeth are pulled out without any anesthetic that will be more entertaining. It's just a pity that I can't give it a zero or a negative score. I wish I didn't waste my money getting this one from the video store. All I can say is that the band it is still on was brand new, almost surprising because the film was so poor. If I remember correctly, I saw it with a girl, I really wanted to go out and the fact that she was sitting next to me wasn't enough to keep me awake, that's how bad this movie was.
