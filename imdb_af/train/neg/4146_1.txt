After watching this thing, read the summary on the back of the DVD and think back to the real movie .... I've become a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a syndrome with a syndrome that swarms through a never-ending forest, where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other than occasionally tasteless lesbian . Where (zombies?) Get out of nowhere and (vampires?) What (seduce?) Purebred citizens on the way to save the world. No zombie or vampire meet each other. The only fights I remember were getting the whales off Bonnie Giroux's pants. Coo Coo ca know! All of them! Perhaps it was because we watched it, and it was too lazy to change it to its own resolution, but it actually made it more entertaining. In conclusion, my underlying thoughts have more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and then act the whole of this film. It looked like Bloodrayne like Citizen F *** ING CANAN
