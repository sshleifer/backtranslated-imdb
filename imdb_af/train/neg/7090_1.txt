I slept in sleep at 7:35. I watched Larry Sanders last night (usually DirecTivo, but not last night). Woke up at 3:00 am (invests banker on the west coast), and was fascinated to see it on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this film was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. It's really very bad. The writing is boring, but directing and editing is just one of a first-class movie school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a video shot. Note, this is shot on VIDEO, not DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. The clips of skateboard videos have a more 'movie' feel to them, then this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the poor director, but I honestly can't remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. Yes, I chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not daring, not fat, not boring, just stupid. I know people who review this review will say "give me an example." I can not. It was 3:00. But trust me, I know you will see it anyway, you will be drawn by the terrible reviews. <br /> <br />
