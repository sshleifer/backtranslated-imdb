Parasomnia has an interesting site, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach. The movie was unconvincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who starred in films like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good), except Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play such roles in his sleep (which is a bit he does here). The biggest problem is that the actions of the characters don't make sense at all. The story is pretty boring and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some yellow scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better, I don't get the good reviews on this one. It's really below average.
