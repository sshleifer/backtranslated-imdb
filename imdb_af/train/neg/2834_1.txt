I have already watched four Bo Derek vehicles directed by her husband, John; Of course, everyone is quite awful, but it's definitely the pits. With the usual thin plot, bad essay? by the director, of course ?? And to act, not to mention the grim nakedness of the star, it's about losing her older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he always admired Hemingway!) but who still appears and speaks to her. In fact, he wants to come back to another, younger body, but actually it does just in the very last scene! Derek is nice as always, and doesn't play naively yet (!) ?? especially during a clogged middle section who pursued her through a killer at a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger than life (read: hammy) here, but it is easily his nadir; In addition, he performs much of the time behind a piece of shiny plastic (it's supposed to be in a kind of limbo)! Of course, his 'replacement' is an attractive stud that doesn't have a lick of talent or even personality. Also in the film are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife) appear? plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed it on his CV!)! It also goes without saying that John Derek was his own film artist on the film, the end credits being filled with useless (and stingy) expressions of gratitude to the many who lent a helping hand and that GHOSTS didn't swipe the board at the 1990 Razzie Awards!
