While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells might be interesting, the performance is straightforwardly pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start because I have so many problems with this movie. I think I'll just name a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. The acting? If you see Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and her teeth) the stars of your movie, do you know you're in trouble? Not that it matters much to me, but it's hardly a-list name. Susan George could have been in a few movies I enjoy, but I never saw her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less the better said. <br /> <br /> 2. The Spirits ?? The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call reminds me a bit of the ghosts in the haunted house. In Disney World. And they are about as scary. And why should they be so obvious? Subtle is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The storyline ?? How predictable can a movie be? The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If you couldn't see where this movie was set after about 15 minutes, you should see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The convenient priest ?? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy is just across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes over, knocks on the door and asks if you need help to remove evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else? It is very difficult for me to think of any positive things to write about. I think I'll give it a tip for the opening scene and a point for home architecture. This is a sure sign of a winner ?? Considering the architecture as a highlight of any movie, doesn't say much about the real movie. <br /> <br /> I'll stop. You need to get the idea of ​​what I already mentioned. And I didn't even mention the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Lobster or a multitude of other problems. Be warned, this thing is terrible.
