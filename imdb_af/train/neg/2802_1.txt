I think if I went to a first school somewhere in the countryside and asked the bottom set of English to write a script, it would make sense. I can then go to the first year drama group and they will work out better than the jokers in this movie. These sounds really mean, but I'm sure they made it a joke and are quite aware that they own (see what I've done there) the skills to do or ever write. <br /> <br /> Just look here if you're incredibly drunk, tall or a good excuse, why your rotten body has been found with slit walls. I now go to my fish bowl and collect all the poo at the bottom. Then I will form it in the shape of a disc and put it in my DVD player, and expect it to do something better than this trumpery. <br /> <br /> Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breasts - 9/10
