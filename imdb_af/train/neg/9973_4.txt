"Problem Child" is one of the goofiest movies ever made. It's not the worst (although some people agree), but it's not the best either. It's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who destroys a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who accepts him foolishly. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I don't buy for a second that a child can act as intolerably as the child in this movie does. It's asinine and ominous, though I laughed several times (I really don't know why). But I can't recommend this movie. I know I'm too friendly. If there is one positive thing about "Problem Child", it is better than the successor who was just terrible. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
