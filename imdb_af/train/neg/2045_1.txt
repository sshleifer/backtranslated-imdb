This movie had to be the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend hired Zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident. Think it was a joke before the real movie. It was terrible. I waited for it to be frightening and it never did. this movie did not have real facts about the true Zodiac killer. The filmmakers did not even bother to investigate anything about the murders. They just chose the name ... so they decided to write a script about nothing that was true to his name. I'm upset that I didn't realize it was the movie earlier. I try to keep something from every movie, I don't hate movies ... ever ... except this one. If you couldn't find it, I'd definitely have it. 1 out of 10.
