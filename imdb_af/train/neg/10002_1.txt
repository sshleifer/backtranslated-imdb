Sorry everyone ,,, I know it's supposed to be an "art" movie, but wow, they had to hand out guns to the screen so people could blow their brains out and not look. Although the scene design and photographic direction were excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. The tanning shots were too long. How long can you look at two people just sitting there talking? Especially when the dialogue complains to two people. I really had a hard time just going through this movie. The performances were excellent, but how many of those dark, gloomy, uninspired things can you take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise it was a rip off from Bergman. And I'm not a fan either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is good, lies.
