A teenager who wants it all commits suicide. This leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking a lot of questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, poor handling. For starters, this was done before 1988 - mostly in TV movies and post-school offerings. Apart from some curse and dialogue (ie the PG-13 rating), it didn't add anything new. The outcome is predictable and Reeve's efforts to work were really painful to watch. He is good NOW, but not in 1988. In addition, his character was dressed like a slab and always got so dirty. It was difficult to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> It's dull. I saw every scene and every "surprise" is telegraph. Basically I can't wait for this thing to come over. <br /> <br /> I had a vague reminder to see it in a theater in 1988 and to hate it (it bombed VERY). It seems uncomfortable about 20 years later. The subject is worth handling, but it's better done (with better acting) in countless other movies. "Ordinary people" come to mind. You can hit this one.
