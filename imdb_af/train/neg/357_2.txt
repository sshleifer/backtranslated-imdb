Just a cause of Sean Connery as a Harvard law professor, Kate Capshaw (does she still work?) As his wife (small age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) And utterly over, Ed Harris the top version of a fundamentalist southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Weird casting, but the movie plays serious thoughts with the audience. (don't read if you ever plan to watch this movie seriously or see this movie seriously because of the spoilers). In the first place, I have repeatedly rolled my eyes through the liberal stereotypes: the police are all sadistic and estimate it black man with no evidence. The accused, witnesses and even the accused's attorney work against him (accused of raping and killing a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard legal profile that gives passion. speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbaric death penalty. He was approached by the convicted grandmother to defend him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery is stopped (thrown ...) by the small town officials and the good IL's boy club, but finds it The case against Blair, the alleged killer, now in the dead of death, is all manufactured . The most important evidence was his confession that was struck from him. <br /> <br /> The knock was administered by a black policeman (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. Connery finds out that another prisoner in the death row actually did the murder and after a few minutes discovered a tetes with a seriously persuasive Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets a trial and Blair is freed. <br /> <br /> I think ... movie over .... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It seems that Blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to use Connery. He conspired the story with Ed Harris in exchange for Blair having murdered Harris. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Connery's fraudulent PC principles, Blair is releasing again! The last 30 min. is a strange action movie that is being attacked on a legal story, Connery and Fishburne are fighting the ceremony in a crocodile house on silence (yes, you read it right) in the Everglades. <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie. <br /> <br /> So, the whole system is corrupt and ineffective, the police are all just bulls and Abu Graib-type martyrs, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to braai. Depressed on every level! The system is completely rotten and the PC white debts that challenge it are also seriously deceived. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Of course, Connery had to make a mortgage payment or something.
