Imagine you are a high school boy in the back of a dark, unfinished theater with your girlfriend. How bad should a movie be, so you would be forced to leave the theater and go home before it ended? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies are often so bad that they are good; this movie is beyond that stage of bad ness. It is painfully bad. Terrible, horrible, crime-against-humanity bad.
