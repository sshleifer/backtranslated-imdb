I caught this movie on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good movie, a Japanese Green Card. I can't say I ever had an Asian movie, rather the opposite. Some of the most amazing horror movies of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a big fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies. I'm not detrimental to a light movie, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I'd like it. Well, I'd rather split my wrists and drink my own blood than to watch this troublesome, bad play again. <br /> <br /> I think director Steven Okazaki should have spiked the water with Quaalude because no one in This movie had a personality. And when any of the characters tried to act DID, as opposed to a line or two, they had their performance as compulsory and unbelievable. I honestly didn't think anyone had ever acted before ... the ANY person who sounded true was Brenda Aoki. I find it wonderful that it is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't even laugh. Even more surprising is that CBS's morning news called this "a refreshing breath of comedy". It was not refreshing, and not a breath of comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer should be an idiot to think about such things. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and woodworkers. Actually, I think "Spike or Bensonhurst" is a better recorded movie than this ... and I went out halfway through that movie!
