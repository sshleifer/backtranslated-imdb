Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress like Demi Moore get involved with such a crap? "First blood" can be regarded as bull *** t, but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course, if you are interested in the crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals), these are the stupid cliches I can think of, you will say, "GI Jane" is a wonderful movie . Only the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this movie portable, but hell, I can't think Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credits to make this film for women with equal rights. It's just mindless propaganda for the US Army and to make it more attractive, they dropped Moore in it. Awful movie.
