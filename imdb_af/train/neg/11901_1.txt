"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the director's career of German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many have it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it absolutely clear; Not only did Wenders lose it, he actually turned into a BAD director, who made scary and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> One can argue that the "time you lose it" comes for every director, but Wender's case is extreme. It's as if he'd completely forgotten everything he knew about cinema and started it again - just to get results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this movie doesn't deserve your time.
