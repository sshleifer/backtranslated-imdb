What do you get when you mix a few cliches with a directional pacing and a group of characters that you don't mind and a failed attempt to create an attractive visual style and a bigger bunch of clich√©s and a bad sense of humor and a very big budget? Why get one of the most unbearable irreconcilable movies ever made! Of course I refer to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people can say while viewing this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the storyline is out of order, it's not yet" n billion times before and much more skillful than in this movie. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the flickering lights and grainy film texture and expand. Transitions! The director is trying so hard on things look good and create a visual style, it's just bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie, or make sense with the screens in which they are involved, and it's too bad that most of they were annoying! "<br /> <br />" I heard this dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" I saw this scene in about thirty thousand movies! "<br /> <br /> "This one too!" <br /> <br /> "Uh, didn't they say half an hour ago? It would be surprising?" <br /> <br /> "If this movie is supposed to be a "tough chick" go to kicking asses ... when why doesn't she do much? "<br /> <br />" I can't believe how inextricably this dialogue is. " <br /> <br /> "How long is this thing? I feel like I've been watching it for more than four hours." <br /> <br /> "I have no idea what just happened, but I don't really feel motivated to try it out. <br /> <br /> "Is it still over?" <br /> <br /> "I want my money back." <br /> <br /> "The songs in this soundtrack feel so abused here. . "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all the curses they use actually detract from the impact of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "<br /> <br /> And finally," I might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me. "<br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is in almost every aspect. Failure to Avoid at All Costs If your home is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that is not flammable, you should be seriously considered to be burned alive. bitterly bitter, it's because I just spent two hours watching this movie and I didn't really enjoy it.)
