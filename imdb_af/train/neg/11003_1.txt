How do I start? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has no redeemable properties. I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle. It didn't get a single smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that someone will spread this horrible movie. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at insatiable humor. The only thing worth doing about this movie was the soundtrack. I'm pretty sure that's the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I'll upload it if I'm going to try and waste the time I just forgot about this piece of crap. I'll leave you with this warning. DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE.
