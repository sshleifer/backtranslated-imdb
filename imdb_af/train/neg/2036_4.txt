The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares for the elderly. One day he decided to kill his family's family. About the same time, he decided to model his murder to the 60's Zodiac Killer. He comes in contact with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a gun (aparently the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some other actors, just not portrayed as the same gun.) And he goes out of a-killin '. Original. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie if you like B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and acting really drowned the plot. I thought the 'blood' was just too fake, the relief was awful in some places, and the dialogue was just too standard. The movie was shot on video, which is good, but editing the movie just made for some weird 'Plan 9' scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a little more Polish, go to something else.
