Just ready to look, can't say I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts out pretty well, the visual and atmosphere gives a creepy feeling like this kind of movie. But it ends when the first lordi monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the band lordi, but they are seriously missed in the movie. Doomsday samples with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's. <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, it starts out as similar horror movies, people trapped inside a hollow hole. But there is no clear story about why and what happens. The viewer is thrown for possible reasons, but the lines never occur and end with nothing but a mess. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with an intriguing start and some good effects, I thought someone cared for the product better. I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their display costumes can be frightening (except them). <br /> <br /> So, the movie is belief for the visuals, I think the money had to go somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to scarcely make their on-stage monster aliases.
