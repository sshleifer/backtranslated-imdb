Jeremy Northam battles a "Total Recall" clone script and disposable romantic by-play to confuse life. Lucy Liu graduated from a timber to a workmanlike finish. You can't fail to laugh when you watch her interviews on the DVD when she uses the term "Femme fatale" and "Romance". French film-noir actress, she's not and they don't have chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This movie fails, not in the plot or action series, but in the lack of attention to detail in the film photography and hamfist depiction of the world of technology around the main characters. Little effort is being made to dress the scenery to represent any nearby cinematic landscape or period. Motor vehicles are many 1990s and the architecture is scarcely modern with open-minded budget plans, rather than conscious set dressing techniques. <br /> <br /> The technology is positively hilarious. Massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" framed by man-portable CD-ROMs with unexplained data gathered, despite the spreading communication network that even the most unknown technologist would be aware of today. There is a clear lack of research done here and given the open-earthed nature of the cyber community, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> DVD interviews also reveal the original movie name was "Company Man", but it was probably thrown out to fill in on Matrix hype. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest link to the movie. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and wrote the Decalogue completely again. <br /> <br /> This is Tele-movie quality and very disappointing for a movie-length production. This may have made a good sub-chart for "Alias".
