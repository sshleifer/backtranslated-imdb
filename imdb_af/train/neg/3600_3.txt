A question for all your girls out there: As a man you've never met before you accidentally called yourself and continue to do so at the most indifferent moments, you would be frustrated or freaked out of you should the police call? Yes, that's what I thought, so I couldn't relax the idea of ​​Marti Gerrard, with the unobstructed attention of Connor Hill. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> It is a very dumb story. Connor Hill's wife was murdered and the plot turned to the question: Connor called Marti so he could have an alibi? But there is a massive gap in logic here, could Connor not have had a hit in service? something that the prosecution apparently ignored. And wasn't there any forensic at the murder scene? So why is the whole trial resting on Connor to call Marti during the murder? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. And it is so predictable that it is brainless. <br /> <br /> My lasting memory of this movie is for someone who made the Olympics. Marti Gerrard is a very sharp downhill skier
