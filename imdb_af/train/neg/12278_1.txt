If you look at this show, you're not quite sure if it's the story or play that's annoying. First of all, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the writers may need to use every click, you can not only judge the general plot, but the arrangement of the screens and also the lines of each character, making the display one or more make another collage from each police series out there. On top of all this is the message of the show that the good is good and the bad is bad and that the good will prevail at the end of the day and that we all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most apparent way. The actors, like the vehicles of this message and nothing more, will use a limited set of actors: the "I am a good bearer", the worried look and the "victory is our" posture, while the bad guys have the "I'm a bad one", and the "you have me" watched, followed by "I'm good for nothing and I have to be removed from society". general development of each display). True story or not, the show is garbage, another proof that producers don't give a boyfriend about viewers, that we are all thought foolish. Well, this series makes every effort to idiotise the living brain out of you.
