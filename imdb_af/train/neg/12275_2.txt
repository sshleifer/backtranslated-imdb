It is a case of a lot of people who think they are so smart, they have a story that fits the time. Remember the everyday political conspiracies that have been caught in the Watergate years, and a little later? Most cash made movies were made in the right way. So cute, cute socialist conspiracies have been caught virtually in their own nail-look. <br /> <br /> I was never a fan of The Conversation I had dated so much as other conspiracy of time, but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a particularly interesting actor to observe. I mean these conspiracy films mostly drown in the noir hero's character pool. Many questions unanswered, lots of discord. Well, at least it takes Bergman to build a movie about such invisible bases. <br /> <br /> The Next Man is a perfect example of his time: serving one political soup with an idealistic character and a terrible conspiracy to strengthen his web to him. Not one part is in itself interesting and the whole doesn't get any better. In fact, you can tell how much it will be bad for the very first rows that a watch closes that murders without ever entering a storyline. Pedestrian at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes that naively move around under the viewer's eyes.
