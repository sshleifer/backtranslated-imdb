I bought this DVD because it has Kari in it and the Mpaa ratings said; "Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> correct, IMO; "Valued R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> The word "sexuality" should come to a "comma", not a "and" because of the big difference in meaning it makes. I think many people who watched this movie agree with me that sexuality and nudity do not exist at all. my first impression when looking at the mpaa rating is that I will watch something like a "live" movie. therefore I feel deceived. story-wise, it was so-so, to everything that really cares about the story as the beautiful Kari was in it. I know I don't. <br /> <br /> Of course it's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
