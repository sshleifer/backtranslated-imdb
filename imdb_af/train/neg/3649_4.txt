It's a fairly small show on the paranormal, though it feels as if Art Bell and his ilk figured out how to portray a career from Carl Kolchak's attitude. Of course, there would probably not be an X file if this show didn't prepare this audience as well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type, but he is a plausible (enough) man to do heroic deeds. Look at his work on the old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he is the main attraction, there doesn't seem to be a girl or woman who is a distraction. In fact, there is not much sex appeal to the show. Something I also notice is that the pacing is not really exciting in a typical way. There is a lot of discarded humor for this show. Sometimes it's just to get the climax. There is a thread of this show that comes all the way to the current MAD MEN display in terms of style. Not that David wrote Chase crazy men, but the people who worked under him at The Sopranos certainly inherited his serio-comic tone.
