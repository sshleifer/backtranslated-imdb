The strange people living in a village are talking about their lives. There is the licker a man who licks everything, a dumpster diver who finds a body he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like a man, ' a man who wants to clean girls from their evil ways. In the extreme, this shot in black and white film is better with the color. The monochrome takes the edge of the two steps from home. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun and start-up, but mostly it is strange to strange things and soon becomes a collision. Since you see the essay you can guess where it is going, not always - but enough to be fun (although I haven't seen the cleaning). Worth a shot if you have nothing else to look at and you're waiting for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix.
