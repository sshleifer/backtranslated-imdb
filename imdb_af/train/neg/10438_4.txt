The movie sucked, it wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting. they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed. and think it's cool to keep this movie next to the hype, the only reasons why this movie is a success ... <br /> <br /> The fact that 50% currently selected a 10 out of 10 this movie looks nice to me, or the movie is going to go public insane or this mood is unrealistic that can have many causes and needs to be addressed. In any case, it is a less than average movie that advertises mouth-to-mouth. Its success can only be described as a marketing wonder.
