Don't waste your time, let alone rent this drink! How it is made is beyond me. (I don't know why there are a minimum of 10 lines. I've already summed up this trashy, but, oh well ...) The acting was terrible, as they all needed lessons. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think cinematography was the only thing that didn't quite suck. Well, maybe the sound was minimalist OK. The one good thing is, if they can make this movie, even make money with it, there can be hope for any scriptwriter with a real idea. So, you all have to give heart! I think the same goes for actors ... if these people are really paid, then you can too!
