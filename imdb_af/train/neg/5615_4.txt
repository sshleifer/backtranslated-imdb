I just watched DVD 1. The program can contain 10 minutes of good information. otherwise it is snotty setdowns of religious people. It is as if director Brian Flemming has only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm and, with these tools, feels that he can easily evade his opposition. <br /> <br /> Flemming also walks extensively in his own personal affairs, and they take the Movie. It never comes back to the subject. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are, of course, rooted in the abuse of education. Arguments of such victims seem irrational, and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people want more data. We should not be told that religious people are tired. More than American Jews need to tell how annoying Christmas music comes by mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, the superintendent of Fleming childhood Christian school rather confronts the informative director on his motivation. It looks like the fairest part of the movie, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little more self-aware, he might have a good story in him about his own (past and present) relationship with Christianity and the abusive institutions that have incremented him in his youth . <br /> <br /> And maybe he can lend his "Christ never the earth's material" to a more serious documentary. I am not studying the writings of Saul / Paul to find out how airy it is, but a quick scroll of Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interviews are pretty good. , they don't much strengthen Fleming's thesis. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and he is not going to shed light on the other non-Christian religions. Harris also has good (and easily Google'd) interviews at Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
