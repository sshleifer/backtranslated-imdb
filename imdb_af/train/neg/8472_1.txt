The movie opens on Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten shooting blood in his waiting mouth from where he likes it, about two feet above him. It was so challenging, and I thought, "Here we go! A good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> Then it died. It was literally the only scene that caught any part of the imagination. It was a slow, tireless drive afterwards. I was very disappointed, as my previous experience with Sands's play was quite nice. However, this attempt was clearly misplaced and the script has left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Even Julian Sands's dubious performance couldn't start saving this already sunken ship of a movie. <br /> <br /> This amounts to a 1.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
