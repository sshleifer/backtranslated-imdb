This installment of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter teaches something or two about pacing and decent, likely dialogue. There were times when I literally shouted on TV for something to happen. Perhaps he thinks he's building up tension, but Carpenter has to cut that exaggerated, over-mundane musical score from his (or his son's) and dismiss the action. How many times the girl said, "Oh no, I can't have this baby!" and "Oh, no, here it comes"? Carpenter takes elements of much, much better movies (Attack on Village 13 and Die Ding) and throws it here as if we have to recognize and appreciate his trademark style. What is missing here is sincere tension and energy. It is as if he is sleeping through the filmmaking process. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, stick to the tried and true classic - The Thing, Halloween, and they live. For better masters of horror episodes, see my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and Dreams in the Witch House.
