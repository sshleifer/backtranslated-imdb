These incessant mini-operetta with an Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so severe, it becomes endurance after five minutes. It is stupid from the start if this shortness opens two military men and discusses the lack of masculinity in the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute he is packaged to Morrocco where he lives a double life than the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who rather wants to sing than the battle. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare own fine ligera opera voices (with little acting ability) and there is also a decent bass to it, but the acting is so random scenes are so ill-prepared that you feel get them to make things as they go. <br /> <br /> These two reels were part of a larger stage production containing six writers. With more room to spoof and warble, the show might have had some entertainment values, but this rushed quickie is no more than an insult to an audience waiting to host the show.
