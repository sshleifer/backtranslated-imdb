Man, I really wanted these shows. I am hungry for some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these "opportunities". But, unfortunately, I'm in the minority, I think, when it comes to the Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing is the irony that it simply doesn't translate well on screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), the King experience cannot be filmed with the same impact as the stories have when they are read. Many people will not agree, but I am sure they must admit in their hearts that the best filmed King story is a pale reminder to the one they read. The reason is simple. The average King story takes place in the mindset of the characters in the story. He gives us an overview of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes flawed or unreal views. In short, King takes the reader places where you can't place a Panavision camera. If an audience looks at the filmed King, we are left with less than half the information that the reader has access to. It is not too far to argue that one becomes a character in a King story that they are reading, while one is limited to small voyeurism of the same character when filmed. As long as King writes, Hollywood will try to shoot everything coming out of his word processor without having to check if they have to. I don't blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and caution to pull out the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works. The task is related to the conversion of lead into gold, or a bit of bad Zen mastery. Oh yes, better luck next time.
