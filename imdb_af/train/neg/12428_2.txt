I loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I still wonder why they made this terrible movie. The thing about the plastic gun and the toy car, which can go into another house, is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny, but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny. Believe me this movie is just a waste of time.
