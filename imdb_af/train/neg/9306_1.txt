This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I have ever seen. To begin with, I would like to say that the cover of this film is misleading in all ways. If you think you're going to see a scary horror movie with a monster gorge, you're so wrong. The face of the face doesn't even look like the cover, it's just an image they found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they've found and thought it looks cool, there's a scene in this movie where some of the gangs are looking for the friend in the old bush, then suddenly the screen shoots into a scene where there is a mother deer. is what loves it. in a shine of sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How is it relevant to the dark forest they wander? I bought this movie from a man at a market and hoped it would be entertaining, if it wasn't abominable, would it really be funny? WRONG! The next day I give it to my work colleague who breaks down the pest called S.I.C. <br /> <br />. Bottom line is: Don't see this movie !!!
