Someone will have to explain to me why every film that contains poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow considered "realistic" by some. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything realistic about the characters (although the actors did their best with very bad parts) or the situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "edgy", "gritty" and "down and dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, taking the camera without rhyme is much more fun. or reason and failure to lift the film to any of the above features in any meaningful way. <br /> <br /> It is a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films inside a movie theater are now all carbon copies, with bad cinematography, non-existent camera direction and many curse trying to overtake themselves as "art". <br /> <br /> No wonder movies like "In the bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such raves. I have found them to be tortuous and very average, but compared to the current slew independent clones like Raising Victor Vargas, they are really brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, an "independent" movie meant that you would probably be treated with some originality and lots of energy and care, and maybe some technical glitches caused through the low budgets, it means that chances are you still get another by-number, we come - Shake-the-camera-around-for-two-hour effort to address the lack of taste of independent distributors pest. And of course, everyone who serves characters and situations that are completely unreal and confronted. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that the independent market has fewer and fewer survivors? Not at all if you watch movies like Raising Victor Vargas who does nothing but the worst of the movies they preceded.
