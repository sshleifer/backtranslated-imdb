This lifetime film takes the middle-aged divorce victim who eventually fights the genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. <br /> <br /> Here is the 40-something-at-home ex-wife of a successful attorney-at-law attorney (college girl) starting a new life after her divorce, helped by a female college friend in opening a new clothing store as a kind of franchise expansion agreement. She even started a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger maybe, landscape architect / gardener (who is black). But then, the horror of earlier women's abominations, another 20 female woman she appointed as a tenant to let a room go, is beginning to take over her life. <br /> <br /> What this new younger women's threat really does is flirt to the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that really belongs to the divorce! She runs the utility bills by not turning off the thermostat! Bad in the fridge! And hang her pieces (African) artwork in the lounge! And so on. Well, she may also kill the cat. Yes, okay, the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough, but it's more than a little ridiculous, especially when it comes to a campaign. The character reality is that a small part of this would drive this insane woman insane. (Why did she rent the room - and from horrors, a much younger woman?) This is supposedly this increasingly arrogant (naked) younger woman, has a mania for seizure control. And our courageous things must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotic hot look, of course) something. But there is this problem. Every time the 20 starts to get into trouble, she uses her power - and flirts or sex with a guy and escapes the consequences. (Well, there is actually the ability to offer good 20 somethings. It just isn't * generally * used in such a way.) <br /> <br /> The point of departure is the device of the 20 dealing with the divorce in the formation of their home lease deals with a written lease made by her. Of course the 40 did not know anything about these things, and the 20 had something to help. The lease gives the younger woman equal rights to the entire house during the rental period, with utility services being charged at a fixed price. Although an elimination process is about to be completed soon, the 20 soon gets a temporary punishment against the older woman, presumably because she has threatened something. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-I of the sexy sweet young thing. Eventually the 40's "heroic" battle begins for THE HOUSE. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or noteworthy thing in this movie is how horribly easy the TROs (or commands of protection) are for women to get nothing more than her unconfirmed saying - although they are generally easy on men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to get control of a home as it is here. In fact, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often be evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no evidence, but merely an undisputed claim to threats, and sometimes even without hearing his side. Even when there is a trial, it is routine impossible to prove threats (to prove negative), when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the prosecutor. (This is one of the only parts of American law where it is true - and this is an indication of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course, this is probably not the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime. <br /> <br /> The absurdly basic premise of this movie relies on the explanation that the 20 is something psychotic and does not use her medicine. But it doesn't make sense. She is not the successful attorney ex-husband, though she does his help (for example, the woman's wrath) in her quest. She went home (technically, to manage the divorce during the lease term). This second younger woman is after everyone who is after the divorce, after matters with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband !! (The ex-husband looks untouched and is actually looking for his flash - no matter, he still gets lost!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough to look for her age. But her prospect, attitude and focus are so small, frumpy and completely without imagination or vitality that it is impossible to care for her. Well, a core group of lifelong adherents, I think, based on the average score, the small number of rats gave it. (I just watched it because it was so bad and mischievous that it had a camping app. I couldn't resist seeing it.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** ( if such a thing is possible with this movie). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a clue. The movie ends with the 20 something that is being thrown out of prison by promising to "listen" and "do what he says" to "something" and "let him take care of her" (he means get her to her) use medicine) - and then mislead and return to the home. There she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonic stalking of her nemesis 40, taking a bath at candlelight, safe in the thought that the younger woman is from her life. There is a fight - and the 40 something the mother wins - by sticking something with an inner needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she has found. She then begins with her caress, mother, and the two women have a bond, female solidarity moment !!! How cute.
