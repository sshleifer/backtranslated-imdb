I really tried to keep this movie, but in the end it just didn't work for me. I saw most of Kitamura's output and found it to be very variable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some fine lines and a fair amount of creativity. However, these features are painfully short in Alive. The plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a nice ace movie. Unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to go before it reaches fairly predictable sites. The action is just about the wise, with the final battle pretty cool, and the previous one over OK. The earlier ones are also surprised by overwhelming camera work, which causes less coherence. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating in the dialogue, but the film is still weak. The characters are not well dropped or well-behaved and the environment and overall color scheme are dead and boring. The movie isn't terribly horrible and has some points of interest, perhaps the judicious use of the quick button will improve it. With about twenty minutes away from running, it could be a pretty good sci fi thriller. But the full length movie is boring. Only recommended for many patient and determined Kitumura supporters.
