First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian Scholl where I attended. Needless to say I was scared. Not because it was frightening, but because the content.Cmon ... I was 7. Anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy. It's very bad, since I was only 7 and I remember it. The one thing that still haunts me is the terrible song "I wish we were all ready" where the choir ends with "... you were left behind". I would not have suggested seeing this one. I'll probably, just for nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. However, the best part of this movie should be when everyone "disappears"; Vacant cars crashing, lawn mowers running on their own ... beautiful hilaries.
