What can I say? I think I should write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal". They use the F word a LOT in this movie, as in every two sentences. I didn't like this movie at all - too many tips on sexual perversions, sidesteps and cheating. And the curse was completely out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of the points are for Mira Sorvino's sexy moves on the dance floor.
