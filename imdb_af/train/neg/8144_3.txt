I just saw it at the 2006 International Film Festival in Vancouver. The synopsis in the festival guide sounds pretty good, so we decided to look this one out. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to being poorly written, it was boring. I will not be taken away from the actors, because there is not much they could do with this bad writing. <br /> <br /> The first bite was clich√© without ironic, overbearing without being funny. The movie would have been better, said Hunt How went with a campy horror feeling. Instead, he took himself seriously and it led to a boring movie. I can't recommend this movie. It felt too long and totally poor.
