I have the 10p.m. show and I have to say that this movie was nothing special. Though I didn't leave, the theater didn't need my time anymore (as I don't actually pay for movies), I didn't really find a redeeming feature. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and things that made me struggle, but most of the time, the movie made up an elevated fan service to the younger one (in mind, more than age, as this is R movie). The fan service was out of place and also very distracting. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his notorious line, but let's face it, it's a lot of hype for very little payoff. The only truly horrible part of the movie was the CG, which has been highly digitized and has not been well-cut with live action. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a reasonable man, I knew I was in the theater that I wouldn't see 'Casablanka', and at least I'm grateful that this movie is an original (albiet inane) idea and not a repetition or franchise To be honest, if you are not part of the cult, you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and the movie within a few weeks in a second round to see if it can be rented out within a few months.
