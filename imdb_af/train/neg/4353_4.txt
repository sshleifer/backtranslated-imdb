The class is a comedy series depicting a wealth of 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That is why it is bad for me that the class is not funny, although it has the obvious potential. It's not enough, just brave. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines. Some actors also have problems with timing. <br /> <br /> Most resourceful written characters are the twin Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem a bit too squared for the good of the show. On the other hand, the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the used-to-couple Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron is picked up for his accent (though by a non-respectful character, but anyway).
