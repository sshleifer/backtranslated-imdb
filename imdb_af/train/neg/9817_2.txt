Wow ... pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> Turn a player / tension / horror into the comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I have never laughed so hard at a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 badly developed characters - either not in depth or too much depth written. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an absolutely written horror movie with silly dialogue, devastated plot, useless scenes, messy characters, bad sound and common development in general, then this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay focused on the classic "food processor" scene and the totally improper police investigators. /> <br /> This is a remarkable new layer in screen performance and writing and to put it in, because the whole duration makes you dumb, daring or brave.
