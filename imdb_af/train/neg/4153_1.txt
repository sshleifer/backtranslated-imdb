I really have no idea how to react to this movie. The special effects were dark, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot, it was on the back of the box. I don't think I can remember that a movie is bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies !! ;) Even that can't save this movie just to be a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand in front of a camera (or in this case). <br /> <br /> I was pretty much lowered by the overall "zombie" effect. As it seems to be zombies in this movie, it's so common that they run here and there over a few, and it almost speaks to a petrol station (one with an internal windshield but no interior room), the zombie movie genre is not even a factor to the end. Even then, a como by a dozen zombies that crush a girl's clothes doesn't really make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> To the vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is OK to me. I'm not sure how vampires are out of the daylight, or why / how a soldier vampire stands in the middle of the road, holding his gun with a stick through his heart and just waiting for the queen of the vampires to flash all the way through. The last segment in the old nunnery didn't make sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asked the other hot lesbian vampire: "Do you think we did the right thing?" by killing the two seeming heroes in the movie, which puts it over the top. <br /> <br /> The acting and special effects were also at an all-time low. You can almost see the snakes plucking out the false blood during the rise of the zombie that has been run by the general. Speaking of the General, where did they look this Kenny Rogers? No idea what he was the general, except generally confusing and misplaced. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $ 3. Not my $ 0.02.
