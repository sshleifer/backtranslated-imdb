I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing I can tell right away is NO comparison. This film was completely ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. A Martian who took different forms. Special effects that look like something a small child would create. In contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a sense for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this film, yes, actually there was one, took place when Ray Walston finally made an appearance. He wore dark glasses and references for life on this planet for 30 years as a kind of tribute to the TV series. But even real Uncle Martin couldn't save this turkey.
