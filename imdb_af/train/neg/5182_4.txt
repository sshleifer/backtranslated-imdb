Like most of the festivals, Hamiltons makes an interesting look at a movie with all ideas and little performance. Although impressive for the obvious low budget, the movie falls into the final turn and becomes extremely long while being pulled out and the obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of murderous outcasts who are trying to survive after their parents have died. They kidnap people, drain their blood and feed something locked away in their basement. There are some nice dark humorous performances by Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing. But for the first half taps in a strange humorous and dark mix that is a surprising achievement. The next half is not that successful, as it ends up in a movie story with unrealistic twists in a ridiculous khaki that changes the whole movie into full shit. It is a pity, although there is no doubt that some talent was involved in this production and although it remains deeply flawed, it remains original and creative. sorry that when it comes to delivery, it fails completely at every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
