For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was terrible. Fast sent it and never got better! Save time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be so good in the comedy. The previews were so big, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought it sucked a chick flick. What's going on here. Film was very slow, boring. I would not recommend it. I want my money back for this one! ABOUT us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid thing to make people think you're pregnant. I thought it would be so funny, I had my own children and I helped to have other children. It could be more in the line of reality.
