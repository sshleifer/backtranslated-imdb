Tom listens to one of those day-to-day radio broadcasts, and some of the 1950s to date will watch TV. However, they did not make television when this cartoon was made, so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shoots in his boots and listens to a story about the "phantom". He literally does everything that the narrator says, like "standing on the end, freezing cold shivers on her spine, her heart beating in her throat," etc. In the meantime, Jerry looks at Tom and laughs his lap at his scary catcher. <br /> <br /> We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon in which Jerry Tom tortured for no other reason than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, this is one thing, but if he himself is thinking, and Jerry is physically (and in this case spiritual) abusing him, I have a hard time getting the "old guy" too root. <br /> These early T & M efforts were also one minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute is a difference. This has been done here because it actually dragged on. It could be cut for up to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went too long. It's usually for Tom and Jerry's. Usually they are much faster.
