John Candy. Should we say more? He's the main reason why you should watch this movie. Most people do not realize how talented he was as an actor. Show him changing from bad sloop to horny jerk. Just a simple (subtle) change of face and down we go. There are many good bits in this movie and very dull bits. The best moments for me are the Kung FU U scenes as well as the big moment when John (in a trance) goes on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that's how much he and his girlfriend love his girlfriend . Surely I read it, you might think this sequence sounds very rough. That is, but it is also very funny, especially because it does John Candy. The story in general is pretty paralyzed and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni with Candy) aren't given enough to do in the movie. Levy has his moments, especially the filming of the wedding at the end (think Rod Serling) and the big scene when he talks to his mother over the phone. Overall a great movie if you had a tough day and your brain was tired. I give this one 4 out of 10.
