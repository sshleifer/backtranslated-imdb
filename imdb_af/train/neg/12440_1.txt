It's the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, stupid, useless piece of dirt I've ever seen, an incredible garbage of direct cult status among bizarre fans. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you, look like "Citizen Kane" compared to that one. Â¿Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's really bad. But if you're looking for that kind of movie, it's for you! I am a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies, the Price-Corman Poe saga and some good blaxploitation stuff, but with 'Star Creatures' they descend straight to the Z level. Of course, if I want to watch bad movies for the lol (the guy playing an Indian head is great), 1 out of 10 works the other way around, so enjoy and enjoy ... if you can.
