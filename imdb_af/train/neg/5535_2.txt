I think the biggest failure that can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30's are in Cambodia. Nonetheless, the conflict there is a bit hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a bit confusing. What makes this a sounding silence is the love story. Why the two guys are so completely transferred to the deep blonde, I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his zombies (as they are) and forget about her. The movie just goes along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest by the water to come to the secret place where the hieroglyphs (or whatever) explain how to turn people into zombies are preserved. I thought they would never get there. One man takes two steps. He stops. He looked around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looked around. The other guy is hiding behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and incessant dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is impassable. By the way, a more appropriate title would be the uprising of the hypnotized.
