The movie is basically a boring string of horrible cliches that do not provide a real cross-cultural insight. The Middle East leg of the journey is described in a particularly annoying way: there are, of course, mud-stone villages, gravel roads in the middle of the desert, women in black clothes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palms are missing from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is many sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you're looking for cultural insight, you have to overshoot this movie.
