My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say, I don't let her watch the new episodes on TV, because I find ALL the characters annoying. Baby Bear EN Telly? OMgosh, how entertaining and useless blabber can anyone think for their 'sketch'? Elmo? Give it a rest, every child loves him, again, annoying and doesn't teach my child anything. Mr. Noodle? what a rejection I think once I showed her the "new" show, she and I were thinner than before. The show certainly took a wrong turn. I remember the Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter. All the GREAT EDUCATIONAL SKETCH OF OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street has since suffered a direct hit of boredom and stupidity. Jim Henson's passing in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, funny and interactive sketches it used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably irritating and full of useless, non-educational blabber. Away to S.S. producers / writers, you have another cartoon show for the parents to present non-creative, non-exercised children, so they will come out of their hair. Per Producer / Writers: I suggest you pick out the old muppets and start to paste similar content like that of the first Sesame street. Lord I don't want my child to talk to Baby Bear or Elmo.
