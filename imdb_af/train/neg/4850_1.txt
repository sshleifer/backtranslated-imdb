Some unrealistic movie breakers are included. <br /> <br /> The real life experiences have disappointed this movie from the start. I am currently deployed as an infantry man on my second tour to Iraq. This movie has nothing close to happening in real life. From the beginning to name a few: the bomber, the EOD elements that roll out solo with no accompaniment, the EOD sergeant grinding from VBC, rolled into ACUs all the time, calling it, go on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene. The list will continue, but it is unnecessary to record things incorrectly with a 2 minute period before more things were wrong; and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people and critics to watch who have no understanding or experience with deployments or the army. <br /> <br /> People with military background or knowledge of the army will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.
