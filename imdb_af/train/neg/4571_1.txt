What the Bleep We Know Know is a deceptive and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (not one of whom is named) running and pontificating in a thorough unscientific manner. Their interviews are cut into aggravating small segments and spread by a few flashing cgi and banal mini-graves. <br /> <br /> The film explores themes from science, philosophy, theology and politics. , and somehow draws some prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult question that the filmmakers want to show. <br /> <br /> These are riddled errors and logical non-illogical conclusions. How did we start with quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying 'two plus two are equal to four, so I can move objects with my mind'. <br /> <br /> There's nothing original in this movie, and almost nothing accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be irritated by heavy-handed editing, invasive and useless special effects and general lack of substance. Trained viewers will be frustrated by tears through the violence done to science and every other subject that touches this film.
