If the original decisive idea was kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie could have worked. Unfortunately, racism literally had to come into the picture and destroy it. The predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist to turn black, replacing Rutger and Ice-T's roles. It was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this movie. Ernest Dickerson's newsroom approach to 'directing' just verified that it was another affirmative action assignment. Master's degree, near, close. Gads, 'whose line it anyway' uses even more creative camera work. Eric's rewriting of 'The Dangerous Game' is at least an attempt to modernize the classic story, but gives us no motivation for why the characters do it. We are never given the reasons, except "no one will miss these people", why the leader (again written as Rutger) does these things. Apart from a sad performance by John McGinley, and a fair work by Charles Dutton, this one does not bother. A little bit of trivia, there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured F.Murray Abraham, and led to the death of the drunk young driver who caused the accident.
