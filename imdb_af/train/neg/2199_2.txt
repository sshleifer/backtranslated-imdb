I caught "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I have some high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, it's just another Visual FX card. The story is pretty lame. The bad lighting and camera work, along with the less than great editing and music, make the film a low quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and the rest The technical production is equivalent to the FX! You can't just get away with cool FX in shorts, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big splash. At least that short, cool, and even a little funny! Nothing can be said about "Sorrows Lost."
