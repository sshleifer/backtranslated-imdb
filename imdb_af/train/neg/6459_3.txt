Such big actors are such a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and terrible character, the movie is not funny, a subconscious message can be seen: "THIS IS A DAMN CRAP !!!", "It's so bad!", "DRY YOUR TV WITH WINDOW" and so on. It's just disgusting and irritating. In addition to folly, sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. Usually I don't care about the decoration in the movie, but that of "Free Money" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a viewer gets nothing! One looks at the cost of common sense.
