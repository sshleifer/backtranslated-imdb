The 1990s started to make the timings flow, left and right. Each network has one, and they all had one thing. Originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mum with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breastfeeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity being destroyed by this show the existence. Titltes ranging from girl you are a pigeon head and so on. How can anyone see this pure and total rubbish? Did our society really become nothing more than a bunch of hills and dead fathers? The people appearing on this show were trash. The people who watched this show were trash. Anyone who wants to see this show is traveled or placed on DVD, is TRASH. People are wondering why Americans are getting big lumps of fat and too fat to even get work because it has such a way of telling them. It's good to be. Having such a trash on TV destroyed morality.
