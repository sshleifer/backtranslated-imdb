Prove that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold. It's definitely plastic, all the way. It's easy to see it without Quentin's involvement. It would probably have been on the shelf for years, and it would suspect that it would ever be produced in the first place. It's about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job at the crime scene. Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role. William Baldwin is better than the serial killer Jones employs. All in all, very poor.
