OK. I know the popular John Hughes movies from the 80's were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this movie have become quite low. <br /> <br /> Yet, after sitting through this crap, there is one key thing I can do "I don't seem to get out of my head: <br /> <br /> I just sat down by an 80-year-old Rob Lowe movie who didn't have nudity and just hints of sex in them. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible, the characters boring and flat, the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult, and the rowing zone is unspeakable, inexorable and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a little strange Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I think, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
