This movie is just a child against the evil genre. Thunderbirds are just the hook to see people see it, but are almost in use. The fact that action is taking place on Tracy Island is just an effort to engage the public. It was interesting to find out what the filmmakers' view of future London would be and how the world fits together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is some of the lines that Lady Penelope delivered, which is highly comical. It provided some light relief for those expecting a revival of the TV series. <br /> <br /> It said it was going 90 minutes in a "fun" way and so it might just be worth watching.
