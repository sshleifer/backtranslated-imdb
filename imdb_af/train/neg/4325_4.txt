The second in the Holiday series is easily the least enjoyable, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> The tasteless, tire humor that first worked so well is virtually non-existent here. This mistake certainly lies with director Hackerling, who is obviously nowhere as good as a director such as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring writing that only spread a few decent lines. <br /> <br /> The role play does what they can; Chevy Chase spends some form of life in the proceedings, but it's simply not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments do not come to their full potential and usually make the viewer worse. All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not at all funny (like how the English SOOO is polite). <br /> <br /> Apart from a few scenes, there is hardly a laugh in sight and the end turns it one in full slapstick. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like myself), the movie is spectacular, but not anymore.
