It was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The scene was horrible and the plot was ridiculous. It's about an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then chants them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, which causes problems in his relationship with his wife. Another plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbian also happens to mislead this guys woman! Meanwhile, the evil lesbian girl doesn't really like her to sleep. It ends in a happy ending where everything is forgiven. The women also become very naked, mostly in situations that stretch reality. badly bad.
