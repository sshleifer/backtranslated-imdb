This movie is supposed to take place in and around Seattle. The, why is Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park shown? Provincial parks are in CANADA, not the United States. The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot to complete with "stylus" to "read" someone into the bridal shop's computer. I didn't know it was possible to use a database storage device. A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced. We learn halfway through the film that this woman works in the District Attorney's office. Then, in the correctional center, a guard actually works Jenks through a door and holds his back to the offender !! This will never happen in a true correctional environment. The director really messed with this one - it doesn't happen in real life. The acting is sufficient. The plot is good. The cinematography is good. However, the many errors found in continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 votes.
