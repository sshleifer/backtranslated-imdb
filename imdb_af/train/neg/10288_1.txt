First, I just want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... this episode makes a mockery of the whole show. <br /> <br /> I don't know what they've been trying to do with this episode, but have successfully created the WORST episode throughout the series. <br /> <br /> There's no story line, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are crap. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "how the furlings look" by creating that stupid "formerly on ..." ...... is simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the writers run out of ideas and it's really bad.
