It was a new everyday layer among the westerners. The writing is ominous, characters are impossible to emphasize and are either disgusting or greasy, the violence has been done terribly and technically not very convincingly. And Tobey Maguire shows us the side of his talent, sleeps through his share with those expressionless eyes and the grumpy voice of his, which only betrays masculinity. 'Ride With the Devil' is one of my five worst movie experiences ever, a western one that will never be outdone in negative terms.
