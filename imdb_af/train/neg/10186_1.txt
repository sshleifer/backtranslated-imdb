Where's Michael Caine when you need him? I have seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this scarcely leading season movie (K-20 episode) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three stars, Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith are struggling with the worst series of cinematography ever, delivering lines to be written by a secret workgroup Dick Cheney style consisting of Exxon and GM lawyers seeking funding for mass cutting. transport and energy efficiency research. It seems to have been filmed in almost darkness, possibly on Super 8. Make Logan's Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel that crossed with Shakespeare. I cannot imagine viewing it without the comment of Crow and Servo as it is not available either. Clearly, what is needed in Hollywood is one of the 401Ks that prevents actors from paying such movies this way to pay for their healthcare. With the theme "rights to pollute and drift", I am finally half of a Charlton Heston como where he delivers his "cold dead hands". Lee, I could have forgiven you in 1989, but 1981?
