I totally agree with the other comments someone has to make. What is Tiger Lily with this movie. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French movies I've seen in the past (actually with Brotherwood of the Wolves, 2 horrible movies in a very short time.) <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the role is really interesting and the original idea is fun. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort were one of my darlings. I was extremely disappointed to see that they had compromised in such a poor movie. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is very bad, as usual, proving that a pretty face and well-known parents can get you into the movies, but they don't necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you want to watch a Alain Chabat, or a fun time, full of fun. LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
