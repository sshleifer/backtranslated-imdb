This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I've ever seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip-offs. Just face it people the stupid humor is already mastered. Make something new for once. All these new comedies are just awful. And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead role. I hope he can jump back from this horrible movie. And Arnetts' character will be just as bad. Hey Will, you read the script. The plot is truly the worst ever written. Now tell me if it's strange. (this is the movie) Rod Kimble's stepfather Frank dies and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod plans this big leap to raise money for Frank. Just so Rod Frank can fight and prove his masculinity. Yes, it's the movie, you tell me, would you spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap! <br /> <br /> 3/10 just terrible <br /> <br /> dam
