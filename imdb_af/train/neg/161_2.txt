If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimp, or John Wayne as a communist spy, you can believe Pat Boone as a juvenile criminal on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you can enjoy this movie imaginatively. <br /> <br /> This film is so stupid that it's not even a champion for a half-1950s sexless love story. And the problem is that Hollywood has made such a big problem about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman, not his wife, on the screen before his release that the audience knows he won't kiss Shirley Jones, so you don't can build any anticipation for the "screen execution". of their love. It's like a western look where the cowboys don't have guns. <br /> <br /> The story is pointless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst movie store, along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from outer space.
