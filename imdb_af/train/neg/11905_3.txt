With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment since he hit it big with 'Paris Texas'. <br /> <br /> 'Land of plenty' is no exception. With the expectation of an average mediocre film, even before I went in, Wenders's ambitions always look better for him. It's now grated, his films are heavy and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure I was watching a comedy mocking Middle America or a few thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Wender's insistence on loading many scenes with a rock song is also very annoying. He covered the holes in his writing and direction by jawing the screens. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people will find this film important and resonant, but in all honesty, this clumsy and didactic effort is just about weak. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Wenders claimed he, while making 'Paris Texas', had great help from Sam Sheppard in writing. Yes, it was Wender's best and he must now understand he needs a good scriptwriter. His films of the past 15 years + were a total mess.
