John Heder was absolutely horrible in this movie. I felt like for the first time looking at a bad college childhood in a student preaching. Anna Farris was par for the course, not good, but not terrible (plus she is cute). Dianne Keaton knew better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (although it was also poor judgment). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will be held forever in the ticking role of "the brave child" unless he does any serious work on his acting.
