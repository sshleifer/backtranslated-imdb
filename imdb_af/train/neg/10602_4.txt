This movie is mostly shit and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Dams stars in this movie. There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best at the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is so bad and the worst acting I've ever seen and the two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can't do anything. And this movie has to be by far one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes' worst movies he did and if you have to see him in one of his big movies, you need to watch Bloedsport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> All this movie is crap / OK and my Rating is 4 out of 10.
