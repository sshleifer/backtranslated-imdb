There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens if we die? And why do their movies make this little bit ??? The point of departure is absurd. Thre acting is a dimensional. The special effects are exaggerated. And the movie is an infinite rifle battle among some of Hollywood's hilarious shots. But then, if they were good shots, everyone would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Bad, it didn't happen like that. Tempted to turn it off several times, I held on to just see how bad it could be. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) The last line is the twist of stupidity of the whole dull, dishonest scenario. This is not even worthy of second feature status at a third-rate in-season. Apart from the general horror of the film, I am very concerned about its impact on young audiences. The Americans divorce such a shit and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. It is truly banal theater on a Brobdingnagic scale!
