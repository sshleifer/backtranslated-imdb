Everyone in a while makes Disney one of the movies that everyone surprises. One that makes you wonder at the end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie will surely become a ghost and kill and rape your town. It's terrible. If you want a senseless, senseless, predictable "action" movie, go straight. I believe that young children may enjoy it, as they want when Good always wins. But I, I like movies where it's a throw that is going to win. This movie never prevents the bad guys. Eventually, when the heroes stay in an "insoluble" pit, you just know they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he should never think about a mystery or idea for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. See this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to see good acting or a good movie. Look at a superman movie, it will be much shorter, and the kids will want it more. For example, the scene where the Cage flees from armed armed men, and the dots are all diverted by a firefighting railing. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just a small town). This movie shows the decay of movies and the film industry into cheap gags and dull, unrealistic action, providing this movie in large quantities.
