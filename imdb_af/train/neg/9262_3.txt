On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil's child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Eksorcist, when girls are owned or devilry, it is very effective. But in Omen 4 it hit. <br /> <br /> Delia doesn't let me think she can be a devil's child, rather she's a kid with issues. Issues that might just help a therapist, rather than a priest. She doesn't look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks bumpy and moody. <br /> <br /> This movie has potential and if made by the same people who made the previous three films, it could work. But it is quite offensive to make a sequel to one of the most favored horror trilogies, if a TV movie is made special. <br /> <br /> At so many levels it falls. It's cheap, the play is hammy and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring sympathy, and you do not row for them. I recently checked it out after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it immediately dated. <br /> <br /> If you think to watch it, then I suggest you don't. Look at one of the others, or look at the Exorcist, or look at the Good Son. Don't just waste your time on this drift!
