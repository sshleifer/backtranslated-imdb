As far as the Spaghetti Westerners go, I wouldn't die this man on the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is really bad, but it doesn't have the brilliance and flash of some of the other SW's I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead, but lacks the screen charisma needed to pull it off. With a notable exception, the rest of the cast is not very good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments I haven't seen before. There is just not much to get excited about. <br /> <br /> The given exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the one brightest place in this otherwise mediocre movie. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for this man can't die. Rosalba Neri doesn't play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone can miss Rosalba Neri for a guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's movie credits.)
