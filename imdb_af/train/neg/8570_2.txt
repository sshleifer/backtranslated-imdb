There is only one thing that is essential for a thorough appreciation of the Indian Runner. Unpack your pants. Look inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Okay, you will do it. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the male necessities: blood, guns, car hunters, most beautiful women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, fireworks - what did I leave out? - Oh, yes, blowtorches. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I seriously hope Sean Penn regards it as a "when I was a child ..." kind of trouble. Since he wrote and directed both things, he is almost solely responsible. An uneven role (Viggo Mortensen as usual, brilliantly proving how the job is supposed to do) is trying to save Penn. Too late. The lines and action are there. Even dedicated, skilled acting cannot change them. <br /> <br /> I found this movie pueriel and stupid, as well as predictable. The dialogue stumbles together - Sandy Dennis breathed my respect for life into a mother-in-law monologue without maternal authenticity. Then she died. After a while, as well as the star's father, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is scarcely perceptible. <br /> <br /> At intervals, the fireworks, etc. appear. Above, to get things up and scare the audience to think that something is meaningful. <br /> <br /> If you are male and under 25, you may worship this movie. Plan to return it to 35. Think you still like it? <br /> <br /> I don't think so.
