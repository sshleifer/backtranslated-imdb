This terribly bad piece succeeds in being racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, pretending to be extremely clever and sophisticated. Horrifying performances, a click-check screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to get away from. Two screens were particularly offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubbed his tongue after being kissed by another man (could it really have been so bad) and the scene where Eastwood was kissed by Schaech's best friend, pretending to be Russian . After leaving the room, she called out "f ** king foreigners"! So much for her a cultured artist who wants to live in Paris!? <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be an active actor on the screen and is amazingly cheaper. It is a pity that he no longer learned to work with leading gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film, and is trying to save this film from a series of gay stereotypes and an ant of homophobia.
