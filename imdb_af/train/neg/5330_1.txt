Some have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made. Well, they're just right. For me, this is the most popular movie ever made! I have never seen anything so rough, and insulting and dirty, and against human nature like this movie. A real embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry, it's not even that bad, it's good. There is no fun to be here as in some of Elvis's other bad movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to put through his pain. Pure garbage. Native Americans should sue here for their poor clich√©d and stereotypical treatment. In fact, perhaps all human beings for the crime should sue and disservice this film to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. Degree: F
