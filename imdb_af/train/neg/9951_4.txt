Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of all kinds. Minus the fangs, of course. They are dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their charm (namely, a sharp tongue and a thick purse, respectively), they seduce desperate souls, which they continue to torment and sacrifice. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> It's not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothered me to think the root of the messy main character. However, I enjoy the sound and the melody of the fast fire (and so-called very witty) comments. I was very impressed with the strong role of the cast, especially David Thelis; Just the character of Jeremy was too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and gloomy, work well together. <br /> <br /> What really turns me off about "Naked" (and the main reason I never recommended it to anyone) is the way it seems to be repeatedly misguided as a valid way to evoke your anxiety . In other words, in a world that sucks so badly, what difference does it make if you hurt a girl, right? To suggest (as some have on this site) that Johnny is not such a person, because he is not so rough on girls like Jeremy, looks completely absurd to me. They are both terrible, nasty people. And they are especially eager to hurt women every time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny finally got what he deserved, as if his bad karma had suddenly turned back and hit him in the hole. But still, she and Jeremy's sadistic behavior is treated to some degree as a blemish. And I can be wrong, but I suspect most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the movie dark comedian.
