From the terrible death tones to guns that fire without making sounds of a character called the Enemy. It's all exhausting, slow moving, relentless drives. It was OK to see the man with the cape and the hunchback lying around. Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the movie of the time, but even in 1936 one would think that even a movie would be a bit more imagination and veracity. I just kept waiting for something of any interest, as people stood to speak and act as they did on a picnic in the office. And then there are the bullets as a previous commentator called. Perhaps the best idea was to look for a water spot on someone's pocket.
