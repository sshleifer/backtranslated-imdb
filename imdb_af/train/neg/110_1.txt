I got this movie from the library right now and I didn't do it. It's so bad, I'm in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn lost her talent at the time, though she was almost done in Robin and Marian. This is the worst thing about this horrible silly movie. This is really only important because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just before her murder. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but idiot between Gazzara and his cronies. Small signals and tiny bends and nods to a real screw ball comedy that is the faintest, quietest shade. <br /> <br /> Who can believe there are even some of the same Manhattan environments that Hepburn so magically and even mystically inhabited In 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the title Gershwin song is too loud and obvious - you shouldn't wait for the credits to find out that something subtle in the cine-musique of the picture woven. to know when the songs stormed out on you. <br /> <br /> "Returning to typing" means going back and going back, I think. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is everything you see about someone who was an actress and always star. Here she even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent continues to grow during that time, as Ann-Margret played, there would have been a bit of life in it, even the incredibly bad material and situations in Mongoloid level. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a wonderful person, of course, bigger than most movie stars who ever dreamed to be, and was one of the most beautiful and beautiful of movie actors. After this terrible performance, she made an abominable TV movie called Robert Wagner, "Love Among Thieves". In 'They're all Laughed', it's as if she's still playing a grace in her 50s. Even in vain and, of course, less intelligent actresses who insisted on doing it like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than Hepburn. Turner acted seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn doesn't take it seriously, can't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tough. Her last, very good job was in 'Two for the Road', perhaps her most perfect, if not her best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And that girl playing the country singer is just sick. John Ritter is horrible, there is nothing else to recommend this movie, except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was really nice. Otherwise, critic David Thomson's often used phrase "lost his talent" never made sense again. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra has lost all the sexual appeal and we have 2 movies with Gazarra and Hepburn - Who can ask anything less? Sandra Dee's last, zealous movie 'Lost', 2 years later, a low budget nothing, had more than that. At least Mrs. Speaking in her own voice; By 1981, Audrey Hepburn's accent did not sound stupid; She will do the PBS gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn. There is a somewhat annoying accent while she is flowing through English gardens with aristocrats or waxes. "What I like most is when flowers go back to nature!" Like in natural daffodils, but in a real fictional movie, she just sounds ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To think that "Breakfast at Tiffany's "Such a deeply poetic thing was with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful women in the world - she was surely one of the most beautiful screen conditions in 'My Fair Lady', which made Garbo in various things and Delphine Seyrig in Last Year. Marienbad 'match. And then it is! And her last short role as the angel' Hap 'in the Spielberg movie' Always 'was just more of the ladies' clothing - corny, witless and stifling. <br /> <br /> I after her memorial service at the 5th Avenue Presbyterian Church, a wonderful service that included a boy's choir singing the Shaker song "Simple Gifts". "The only thing not listed in the program was the sudden play of Hepburn's song 'Moon River' on the firefight in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', and it has a lot of emotion and some real tears in the brought congregation. <br /> <br /> A great lady who once was a good actress (such as 'The Nun's Story') and one of the biggest and most beautiful movie stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's that is a very bad become one. It's not all that common. And maybe it's just a wonderful person who, in making such things as movie shows, is trivial, yet has the mood to show mercilessly the errors - which contains all her late filmwork in abundance. Most of the talks about Hepburn's miscasting are about "My Fair Lady." But the one who had had the original actress in it was 'Wait Until Dark', which Lee Remick played on Broadway. Still, as Hepburn celebrated, she was in many ways a better actress (Hepburn was totally incapable of playing something really sordid), although Hepburn was at least sufficient in that part. Then all her acting retired.
