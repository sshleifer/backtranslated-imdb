I'm so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was incredible! However, my expectations of Disney have become, I never thought they would be so stereotypical. There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of arbitrary martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate them turning Wendy into a normal teenage girl ... But fortunately most normal teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls - are far less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. And from a cultural point of view, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls wrapped in popularity and fashion, but they are pretty scarce. And even those who are still are pretty decent scholars. Another stereotype, maybe, but a pretty real one. Because that's how Chinese parents work. This is how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to go for authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love affair with her family. <br /> <br /> It just adds to my frustration with American movies. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that sound sensible. We do not walk around to smile at all, and we do not know any form of martial arts. We are a PEOPLE, and I would appreciate it if someone wrote an Asian part that we didn't portray as a sad caricature.
