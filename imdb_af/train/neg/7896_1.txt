Not sure why this movie looks like such elevated reviews. <br /> <br /> One night when I watched a "bang" on TV, I was bored with the silly, random plot on the screen. The whole movie looks nothing more than an exercise in meaningless, artificial self-ability of the filmmaker. The fact that the director / writer goes through a moniker alone reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> Those interested in indie movie would be better off writing and daring to say something more entertaining than this total waste of time.
