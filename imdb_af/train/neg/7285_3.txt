The sun must sit on this movie forever. <br /> <br /> It's going forever (which isn't usually a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's List), but is so annoying. The aging of the actors is incredible and so is the prolonged never-ending story line that actually looks nowhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and film.
