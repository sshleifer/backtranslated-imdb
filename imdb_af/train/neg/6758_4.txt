Certainly the most beautiful woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives another great show here. Although her work in the American Nightmare was much better, she is still worth watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with your typical Melrose Place types, chisel-like features and seductive curves I've never seen before. . Unlike Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I've seen before in the similar Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a group of California arrogants who initiate the poor naive Debbie Rochon in their click. They tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more, but to be accepted by these cool people, she quickly kills a person, and now the group has to decide what to do with her after she fell for their joke. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $$$$ (Quite! Debbie Rochon sometimes jumped blood over her and all the murder scenes are done in your face. Gore dogs will surely enjoy!) <br /> <br /> DOCTORY: $$$$$ Debbie Rochon also has several naaktonele like many of the notable actresses and actors. The pool party just looks like an excuse to get everyone naked, man and woman. Julie Strain also has a topless cameo, but her character is gone to the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Could get a higher voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a stuffing between naked people. B-Rate movies often use nudity, but it's an excessive borderline . <br /> <br /> WARNING: $ (The acting is the standard to say the least. Rochon is always at Reat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in the American nightmare Danny Wolske did a good job as Debbie's object of lust, but the other actors were nothing to write about).
