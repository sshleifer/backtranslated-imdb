I gave 1 to this movie. I can't understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian theater, made such a movie, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the movie are insignificant, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. Hope that Scola will change radical themes and style in his next film.
