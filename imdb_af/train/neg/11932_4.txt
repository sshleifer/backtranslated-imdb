Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he saw Gruner, which he calls a good science film, Nemesis. As we watched it, we quickly found ourselves through the BS drama parts to reach the incredible action sequences. Gruner likes to kick and kick and kick. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner character is a graduate who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one he grew up in. He finds himself after the boy who lives with him, because he really wants to join the Mexican gang that paints his family. Instead of including, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or makes them worse) and works to escape his block of these gangsters. <br /> <br /> The plot was very cheesy and easy to think. Gruner is probably not much known because of his dissertation or this movie is something to compare possible choices. This ghetto is pure hell and I liked to see the meager characters crawling it as if they had a chance against Gruner's character. The music was typical action music (thin pianos and timpani, swelling guitars) that were not as bad as I sounded. The director really needs to take the action instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. <br /> <br /> Eventually I gave it a 4/10 because it was really an average action movie. for Oliver Gruner to die in, but the overall feel of the movie allows you to get more closure on what you've just seen.
