I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's Memoirs still seem to be a failure to comb Western and Asian arts. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes, some can only get to know them. The excessive cherry blossom was actually exaggerated. This is probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the prosperous type, since truly beautiful geisha would not be the weathered pumpkin in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest mistakes. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. An actor / actress can play any role when he / she can look. Gong Li is big, but the power of emotions she showed in this movie was not translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actress, didn't even look like a Japanese. Some comments mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine features of Japanese women, with which I can no longer agree. It is so delicate that I do not accept that even all the modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha, let alone the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably little Japanese culture . <br /> <br /> Geisha is a great shot for the excitement of American audiences. But it will be an insult to the movie itself and to art if the Oscar has won the best costume, best director or best photo.
