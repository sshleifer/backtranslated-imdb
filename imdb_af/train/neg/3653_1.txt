I can't help it, but I like movies that are meant to be scary and just bad. I personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under the abyss! Watch this movie and enjoy a song. Don't expect to see any academy acting awards. More chance to understand the movie itself. In all honesty I have seen much worse than this. Plus some maniac cruising to wipe the desert the same people who are just dead are incredible that it should be original. I think she is one of those love or hate movies. you can make your own thoughts, yes, it's terrible, but it somehow pulls it that's why i love it
