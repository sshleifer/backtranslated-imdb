Salaam-e-Ishq is a beautiful but superficial comic soap from India that fixes us with six interwoven stories of romantic love (which in my estimation is at least four stories, too many.). <br /> <br /> Filming like an intersection between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer corporation, the movie is a spread mishmash of exotic settings, brilliant colors, sexy showgirls, high-step song and dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, flashing character aside, corny dialogue and over-the-top comic performances - all fairly standard edition when it comes to Bollywood events these days. It's a tiring chore that just tries to keep all the characters straight while they dance, prans and their way through the incomprehensible storyline. <br /> <br /> There is plenty for the viewer to establish his eyes here - not least all the deadly beautiful women - but he will need the patience of Job to get him through.
