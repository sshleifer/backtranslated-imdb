I'm a Christian. However, I was always skeptical about films made by Christians. As a rule, this is "know-nothings" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a horrible job on it. The acting was terrible, and if one were not familiar with the Bible in one way or another, one could not understand what the film was trying to do. Not only was the film terrified, but the people who made it even had mistakes. However, in this "criticism" these facts are irrelevant and too deep to dive into. In short, the Omega code is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, except for the comical relief of the daily grind.
