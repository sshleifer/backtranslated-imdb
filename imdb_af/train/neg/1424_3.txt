The movie has a good start with the portrayal of an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces the first half to two very sympathetic characters. But later something happens and all the sudden Shannon changes into this straight-faced, second-hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in its own context. The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of claws, bad acting, a terrible plot and even worse stunt coordination. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and split, Bruce, but his daughter made it even more embarrassing than the double Bruce Lee played. I really believe that she can do much better than that and I hope she will participate in a better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a true hard core fan and don't care about quality, go ahead and see this movie. I was personally looking forward to it, but just disappointed.
