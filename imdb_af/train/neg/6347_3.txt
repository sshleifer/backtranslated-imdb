I'm probably always going to see a Woody Alleb movie, as one never knows when he can just make a real return to his past greatness. Only one or two great moments or lines can make it worthwhile. Unfortunately, this movie just doesn't make a score. To say this, actually make me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my response is much like many other Woody fans, but what can one say? It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which I think is pretty good. To put it all, I'll probably go to a new movie. Woody can come out in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect the WOODY!
