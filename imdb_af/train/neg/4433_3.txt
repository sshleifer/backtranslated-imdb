I wanted to keep this movie much more than I did. That's because I love strange comedies - especially the peculiar ones that totally surprise you. Although this one often surprised me, it was almost never pleasant. It reminded me of South Park because almost every social norm was violated until the only one left was too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (from almost every kind - from pot, heroin, speed to gum sniffing) - to prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., The movie to the hilarious (?) Subject of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (about 12 years old) to sleep with neighbors. In fact, at one stage in the movie, she gives this boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny ?! You need sheep. This movie just goes too far and delves into the "black hole of comedy". What should they do next, cancer or rectal tumors?
