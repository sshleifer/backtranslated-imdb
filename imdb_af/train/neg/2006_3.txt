It will help to know why it took so long for a book like movie-ready "The House Next Door" to be adapted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason may be the design of the house. The house in this lifetime movie is really so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that somebody probably came and destroyed it as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to put down when I came in ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people who are looking for anything that is occult in life, and that is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was a kind of devil (or personified the devil) without seeing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, this is a horrible book for the most part, and I don't think it appeals to the people who are living. Perhaps someone will come up with another version of the book in the coming year. A better home. Better music. " Better screenplay and darker lighting ... will definitely help.
