I only notice it as a "spoiler" because of some of my commentary content, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> As I read the comment, it is clear that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but disdain it, while the Democrats seem to be in his so-called truth. One reader even indicates that he believes these events happened or could have happened when Bush was in high school. <br /> <br /> But with regard to content as I see it, trying to be neutral is that the group that made this series really should really be Bush haters. In the episode I last saw, s02e03, it showed that the program had to be compiled for a long time before McCain became the forerunner of the nomination; for the other forerunners are all known. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of add-on cupboards. I thought the series should be made in Europe, certainly not in the US, because I know of no home in the US that doesn't have built-in cupboards, and probably in the homes of the artists. <br /> <As I look at the show, yes, I get caught up in it, I'm surprised to see what a huge desire the writers have to do to do what they can to embarrass our president. Certainly there are problems that most Americans will agree, but it is no reason to be so hateful in public exhibitions seen around the world. Perhaps the trend has now been introduced through this show and network so IF Obama or Hillary came in, would they continue to produce the same kind of humor about them? <br /> <br /> One more comment on commentator's comments. If there was a kind of change in the election in 2000, such a writer was sure there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. Regarding 911 events, I believe it came into effect when Clinton was president, and I can't see how Gore would be president, anything would be very different.
