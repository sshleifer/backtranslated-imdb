My wife and I started to watch this movie with good luck. It looks hot and touch. It started well; but soon becomes boring and honestly idiot after a while. It got so bad we turned it off. The movie was poorly acted and honest. We couldn't really understand or wanted to understand exactly why or how hell could get them with this woman! You lost compassion for her after she was rude and singing and cleaning acting Wackos. I would have committed her. And of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood, we should throw it a "gay" character! This movie was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
