When someone repeats a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorable compared to the original. There is also a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unknown to audiences. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 TV version of "Double Damage" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The biggest difference is that the remake has no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous learning insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just looks world-wide and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, looks almost bored with the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is all wrong with the fucking, stubborn Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just excellent in this evil role, Eggar is polite and manageable and just looks completely out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson's boss Norton, and John Fiedler takes the Porter Hall role as the key witness, brings a bit of life to the movie. In particular, Webber recreates the Norton role in a 1970's context. <br /> <br /> But after the movie started, the whole thing is just as lying there, without any life or electricity. It's a movie that never had to be made again.
