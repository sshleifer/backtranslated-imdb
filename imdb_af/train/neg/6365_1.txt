Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Spoiler comments and so on. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a sickly-retired cop (cliche!), helping everyone - smiles like a post-lobotomy patient and complains about his dead son. His adopted son comes back from Armed Forces' "Special Ops" and because he is "seen" - portrayed by pinching his teeth when someone calls something about the past. Time to clear the streets of another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed the bad boy) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, the love interest is a pretty young woman who decides no reason she wants to jump the leg of the former army. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this movie, but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. All this has been done before, it is all done much better (Ong-Bak is an excellent example). It's the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the film is called HONOR (Spelf Wrong for the Americans) and the tagline has "from the makers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - watch other directors David Worths' other films and you'll soon realize why They put these 2 movies there, even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon - really say it all. <br /> <br /> If you don't see this movie, I'll give you Â£ 10. <br /> <br /> PS - Don't miss out on character names, but tell you something.
