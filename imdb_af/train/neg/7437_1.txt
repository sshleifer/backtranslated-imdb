This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. Full of clich√©s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense! I can't believe so many people gave this terrifying movie a 10. My guess is that they are the movie maker. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I'd like it. Too bad IMDb doesn't allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it was because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What is sad is that I have never had great expectations of this movie, but I have changed briefly. Take my word, don't waste your $ 8 on this piece of waste. The only entertainment I got from the movie was fun from the director's name. Overall, highly not recommended!
