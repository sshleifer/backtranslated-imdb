One of Boris Karloff's true vowels. In essence, the dying Karloff (look about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs cash to complete his experiments before he dies. From Morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else, he goes to southern France where he works as a doctor while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he made an agreement with the young rich woman of a cotton baron who died. She will fund him if he helps her poison the man so she can take his money and go on with a gigolo (who I think is married). If you think I got it from looking at the movie you're wrong, I had to read what other people uploaded to find out. Why? because this movie was lost to me for two minutes. I didn't know what was going on with his many characters and multiple summary plots. Little is spelled out and not much is said, until the end when I don't really give up. It's a dull mess of interest just for Karloff's performance, which is rather strange. To be honest, it's the only time I've ever seen him in the bizarre area of ​​Bela Lugosi. It's not every scene, but a few and makes me wonder how much they hang out.
