Even in a bad movie, there is usually a redeeming feature, something you can say yes, it was terrible, but there was that show, or that part of the screenplay or that special effect, it was just awful. The acting was laughing, the writing terrific, complete with very inexplicable breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were at its best. It was a very bad movie and one that even Drew Barrymore wishes has been wiped out of history. Look at it if you want to: a) Struggle for self-inflicted pain. b) Just look at how bad a movie can be. This is a movie where I can use the clich√©, "there are ninety minutes of my life that I will never return" with some justification!
