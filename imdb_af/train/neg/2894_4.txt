I recognize the problem I have with the many celebrated Ealing movies I have seen so far can be mine. To my liking, they are also black and ripply funny, or so light in tone to be unsatisfactory as comedies or stories. It's a self-evident way to say I wanted to keep "The Man In The White Suit", but struggled to put me through its short term. <br /> <br /> Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be gentle that way, but he is foolishly committed to progress in his efforts to develop a fabric style that cannot be broken or dirty . He uses a factory lab for his latest experiment. He is confining himself to material and human limitations. The latter are the wonder mills who do not understand what he belongs to, then find out and even more committed to stopping him. <br /> <br /> "These are small thoughts like yours standing on the road," Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror he's struggling to tell the man. <br /> <br /> One problem with "Man in the White Suit" is that Sidney's vision of progress is also extremely small, even more so than those of the bosses or the laborers who also distort his work. My problem is more elementary: For a comedy, "White Suit" is not funny. It is a very serious script that too often tries to squirt its poor attempts at humor from spit tasks, double tasks, triple and dark tasks. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney stares at, and goes to 'Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop' endlessly and gets angry from every visitor until Sidney either extracts or tries his miracle from it try. Like any other humor that works well in this movie, it leans too long. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Guinness get into a movie, even though it seems impossible to be young and serious (though in its mid-30s). He looks so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general he played in "Doctor Zhivago". He is the same cold fish or he ignores the sad affections of the influential mill girl who offers to give him life-saving when he loses his job. (Vita Hope as Bertha), or the more sultry charm of young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his real ally in his struggle against "shabbiness and dirty," as she puts it, to make the words sound as impossible sexy as just Greenwood can. <br /> <br /> Supporting players make "White Suit" work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger of "Bride Of Frankenstein" fame plays a particularly nasty captain of industry that looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh like a dead rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is here as memorable while playing a shiny medical officer in "Lawrence Of Arabia". Then there is the indisputable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her little moments on the camera, among all else. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played so straight that one would not think of director Alexander. Mackendrick has ever worked on a comedy (his previous Ealing comedy "Whiskey Galore" doesn't return that impression). Roger MacDougall's play puts the notion of scientific advancement as a potential disaster, but fails to offer dull Sidney in anything but the most common-pleasing lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing comedies are remembered to capture the human side of the comedy. Yet, the Eings I have seen never seem to do that, only when they are aggressively playing against our own sympathy. "Friendly Hearts and Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick, again figure) are classic in this way. "White Suit", on the other hand, is a useless mess that falls apart when it needs to be, just like the unfortunate suit.
