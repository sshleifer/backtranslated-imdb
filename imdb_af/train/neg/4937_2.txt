It's a 30 minute show about one joke. The joke, Cavemen is not treated fairly. Hahaha !!! He can't call a phone because he's a Caveman. Cavemen is not as smart as people. Oh yes, that Cavemen is so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can just run off this joke for as long as they already have the Geico ads. This display does not earn a time slot on national T.V. <br /> <br /> This show is trying hard to be funny, but it's just not. I thought this show thought it was like a "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show." Means they go to the pub and try to sleep with many women. The crying cave man is annoying. The cave man with the glasses is too clever to be a cave man (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can't figure out why I don't care about them.
