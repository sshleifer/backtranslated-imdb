We all know that many dudes have won the 80-year-old genre and deserve nothing but our deepest dislike. Maybe it's a little hurry, but damn as "High Slaughter" wasn't terribly original, even for a beater. Pretty much, the plot involves a child who has experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliation at high school and returning to the dilapidated building to take revenge on a group of former bulls that are all reminded. As you would expect, they are killed on 1 April by a masked man through electricity, burning, hanging, and chemically changing beer. I have a number of issues with the plot details and settings of this movie, but in the light of the end, I feel the need to throw away my complaints and just say it's a total waste of time. Ignore any idea to view this movie ...
