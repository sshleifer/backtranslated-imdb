It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised. Believe it or not. The storyline is traditional, all cliches are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so poorly written that you actually laugh when the other half-actors try to make it sound like that. The picture is not too good, the music is so malplace that it really made me angry. The actors do not even try, although the writing makes it almost impossible, you can expect more from people who have been performing for 30 years and so-called action scenes can actually lack the "action" themselves. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why this kind of bad movie is coming up, who is financing this shit? Where's the screening? And why on earth do actors play this impossible manuscript? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre without even reaching the theaters, but even their straight-line look really looks at it. professionally compared. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything positive about this, except the title that explains it all, I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life.
