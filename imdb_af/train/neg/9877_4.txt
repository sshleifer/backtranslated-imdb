Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. West Anderson responds and respects the short book of the same name on the big screen in a full movie. While respecting Anderson, an incredibly talented man, the movie was lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson apparently left the story to know he was a talented man, and if it was a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, it's Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I'm going to let him out easily. I will admit that it has a smart and fine spirit, and the animation is nice, but the movie is getting harder to go in, leaving the story behind and doing random shots of random things. The characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney )'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially getting involved. The movie doesn't make it so awful, but it gets closer and closer as it goes. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on track with another great movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie of yours was a great disappointment.
