Let me first say that I enjoy watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these movies leave more of a lasting impression than the truly amazing. This movie is bad in a disturbing malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's delusional ego does not only limit to unprofitable inefficiency, but redefines the meaning of the words. It must always be the barometer for bad movies. Kind of Mendoza line for movie. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and stars as a blunt object. Arthur Sailes struggles women and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben are "dead behind the eyes". Sheet battle for marriage equality. As a libertarian I believe that gays have a right to marry. Ben and Arthur do more damage because of a host of homophobes. The depiction of all things Christians is so ugly and manifested, the trademark Mraovich, that you cannot take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor, the Bible that made Jesus' freaks, is so terribly upset / actually gay that you have to wonder how he was cast into this role. This is because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also director. Worst of all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think of leading man, are the words pasty, balding and chubby in mind? Sam also delivers lines like dominoes pizza, cold and usually wrong. The final count: you suck on writing, directing, acting and deciding. It's the Ed Wood quadruple crown. Congratulations on your terrible little man.
