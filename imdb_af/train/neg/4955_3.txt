Given the recent and pretty good Batman the Brave and the Bold, it's time to take a deadly blow to Batman's life-threatening mistake. As a big fan since the first revival by Tim Burton 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tonalities in the character, dark or camp. This one is just not credible: too many effects, poor plot and so few questions. What is wonderful about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist, etc. The Batman just shows him in his karate days. And by the way, how does the Penguin get to have such virtuosity when he jumps in the air, regardless of his portion correction? And look at the Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotype reggae man, which Batman fan can accept such a betrayal? Not me. Batman is much better without the "The" article before his name.
