Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible ..... . . . . . As a rabid Robin Williams fan, I felt it necessary to buy this movie as the first screen appearance. Wow ... I couldn't imagine a more suspicious movie. In essence, the movie takes one bad joke after the other that your uncle Artie will tell you to dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-shot. <br /> <br /> I'm all for bawdy humor, but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar or rippled. It was just annoying. There are no reasoning features for this movie, except Robin Williams fanatics, like me, who must own every piece of the movie.
