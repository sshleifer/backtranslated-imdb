Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, the one line summary says it all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better. Much better! <br /> <br /> In the Samurai, Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in the cage and steals cars for his work (with so much tension in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai looks for death in dignity and is shot in his hand with an empty gun. The world has changed, he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Delon doesn't kill as many people as the Ghost dog. But I think Jarmusch kept "Leon" much or even "Desperado" from Rodriguez. So he added it. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So how does Jarmusch think? Where is the unique, original idea in this movie? <br /> <br /> I can't see the point of making carbon (celluloid) copies. <br /> <br /> A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
