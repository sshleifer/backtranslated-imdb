Don't just hate it if you order a steak, but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> This is how I watched this so-called Battlestar Galactica. Arguments can be made about his quality, but the fact remains, it's not what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine sitting at the proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You've been waiting for them to bring back their famous New York Strip steak you loved. When you come to dinner, you find that they have named the "New York Strip" on a chicken bowl. You complain, but the waiter just says "but they're a good, good sir!" Do you really care if the chicken is good? You Wanted New York Strip - A STEAK! The waiter then explains: "You hurt, you wanted to do it, like you soup, Zomezing NEW. We felt they would be more popular if we called it the name of our previous delicious deesh." You ask if you will ever find the original New York strip on the menu, but know that because the restaurant now has a New York Strip, now on the menu, you will never see the original New York Strip - ever again. <br /> <br /> This is the case with creating something new and hitting the "Battlestar Galactica" namesake on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series is a horror for all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the production team in charge of this new version obviously had contempt for the original. The team that was in charge of the resurrection of BG had to have loved the original series - trying to improve what the fans loved. Don't try to sell this new series without using the Battlestar Galactica name. <br /> <br /> If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a NEW show, then do it! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we love to try to attract viewers. It effectively robs us of the opportunity to look at the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We've been waiting 25 years to see what we knew as BG, because we have something about the original desire! We didn't just want the NAME and the remnants of the basic concept. There are things we liked about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the BEST elements of the original are probably omitted. Sure, the original BG was imperfect and could have used any update. However, this mini-series was not an improvement in any way, but the special effects (which were good, but not something unusual to today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will be back and forth on the quality of this New Show, but we won't forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> It is said ... I will comment on the merits of this new mini in itself (not in comparison with the original): <br /> <br /> The order of battle was the best Share. Of course, effort is made to make the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at the effect". I wouldn't say these ranges were exceptional by today's standards, but they were in line with the original films made for the cable. What was the similarity to this "pseudo-live cam"? Some opinions have tried to eliminate the effect of a "real" camera with negligent tracking and rough zooming. However, this was overused as there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only example I have seen of such "live cams" being used effectively when we suspected security camera behavior. <br /> <br /> The writing, you ask? The writing felt that it was written by a teenager, for other teenagers. The characters have cardboard and stereotypical feel. Indeed, the whole story came together from other well-known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were the few elements preserved from the original series. Of course, it was "obscured" for digesting your average TV audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction was pitiful. Rather than drama based on subtle appearance, expressions and good timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point that it was so obvious that they had lost the ability to move any sophisticated viewer. This was evident in any interaction between Adama and son. The director had to try to make sure that the most dense and uncomfortable viewer would not miss it even if he didn't pay attention. Sorry, real people do not constantly do the same. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have seen it as a BAD show if it was on its own. Nothing great; It will never be honored by honest sciFi fans or artisans, but it will be seen by the masses. I could personally have lived on it. I just looked to see how it really captures the original spirit. <br /> <br /> How this mini series is always remembered is a symbol of how quality storytelling has been set aside to address larger numbers. How even SciFi Channel plunged its productions to meet the masses, unlike its true niche market, the Science Fiction fans. This will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving our chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with just one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
