This week I just thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim, seeing just the two "Lost Boys" movies last week and all. Not that I'm a fan-boy - not far - but I liked the two Coreys in some early-teen films. <br /> <br /> So, I prepared myself for three films starring him. Unfortunately, I chose 'Dream Machine' as a first (it has never seen it before), and it was so terribly terrible, I just decided to close Corey back in my closet and once again abandoned him before I have something else about it. But I managed to get through this movie first. I had the impression he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Off Day" (1986), but caught him in his own cheats. Almost the whole movie wants it to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to create a thrill. The only good thing about Dream Machine is the premise: a dead body in the body of a Porsche. The rest fails so badly, it's embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. I can dig him as his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some form of guidance. This was clearly not the case in "Dream Machine". So, we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haim's perfect friend? Just a blonde chick that hardly has any lines in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? Someone who falls flat on his ass as the villain of the movie, tries to steal the whole movie back, never really behind, and then he thinks at the end of the movie Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner mask) and mistakes Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't think they could have made this flashing a lame if they tried. A silly, unfriendly movie with a story that doesn't lead anywhere by a director who doesn't know how to direct his role. Great achievement! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: Who had your idea of ​​smiling you directly into the camera in the last movie recording? Yours sincerely or the director? Not done so.
