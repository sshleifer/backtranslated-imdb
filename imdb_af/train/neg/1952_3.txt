Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and disturbing thing about this attempt to recreate Scooby-Doo and the company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is squeaky and doesn't sound like he ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They also changed the outfit and the classic way of running the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what they're about with the rogue, but it certainly doesn't follow the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not the real Scooby-Doo-type animation. But the strange animation used for other World Cup shows has grown on me; It can be. <br /> <br /> It's a look at - once - if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. It is true that there is enough to enjoy one. Besides, I'm not trying to be a rigid, nitpicking fan. Develop or die, as the saying goes. We will see how it looks after two episodes - then I have formed a much more solid opinion.
