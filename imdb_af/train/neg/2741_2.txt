Spoiler !! I love Branagh, love Helena Bonham-Carter, loved them together in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - but HERE - <br /> <br /> I can understand an actor's desire to stretch the romantic stereotype to avoid. Well, they did, but really, the script turned, Bonham-Carter's clothes were worse, and the occasionally accelerated madcap series could be a Beatles movie issue, or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. <br /> <br /> I never got the point - other commentators say the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt it. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not engaging. The banking robbery business was just painful to look at. Certainly not amusing. <br /> <br /> Bonham-Carter's realistic (one supposed) attempt as a realistic speech was harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accents in "Full Monty." <br /> <br /> The poetic ending, buried high on a hill with her under the monstrosity of his plane, was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classic or something with a spine and an arch out there. Donate it to PBS. <br /> <br />
