Some people have made a point of rejecting this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period. Get a grip and read a book. There were quite a few Asians (Chinese), there were quite a few blacks (free men) and everyone outside the pagan class had access to guns; This is the second change you know. And as far as the use of modern language is concerned, none of the Western people became nostalgic of actually used language that was in line with the era being portrayed. Americans had different accents, used different bowls, spoke very differently and used many words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Don't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just haven't dug it. Be honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you see.
