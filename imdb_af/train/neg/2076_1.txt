Well, I must say it's probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were extremely rude (didn't expect it as a PG movie) (graded PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this big throw I at least expected a good thing, but I didn't even get it. I'm a big Rainn Wilson fan and it's the first time I've been very disappointed with his performance. No one of Luke Wilosn's or Uma Thurman's characters is the least enjoyable and I could really have cared less about what happened to one of them. I didn't expect it at all, as in the past I really chose other movies (for example, Six Days, Seven Nights). This movie was NOT worth the $ 10, it costs me and I strongly encourage you not to see this movie. . I guarantee you will be as I beg this movie is over.
