Some time ago I heard from a friend about this movie and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement, because we both heard it was a scary movie, very scary. How disappointed was I? VERY !!!! Apart from that one scene (we all know what little) nothing happened !!! I expected to see the woman in black a few times and do some more jumping scenes for her, as it appears at the window or over the hall or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all reviews here say What a scary, alluring, atmospheric movie is. I just didn't see it, I'm scared. Perhaps there is a difference in what people in the US find terribly here in Britain. <br /> <br /> A major departure from all the convicted reviews :(
