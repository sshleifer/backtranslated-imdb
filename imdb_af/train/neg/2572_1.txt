deliver this movie. The best thing is when the uncomfortable teenage man runs away from the babysitter and in the background he looks like he's never been near a bike in his life, trying not to fall off. <br /> <br /> but this movie does not stop there, when it gives a scene of nothing less than 5 minutes later, but an arm that goes through a fence and a cooler that draws a beer. come out. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical braai fathers, a variety of plot lines nowhere to go, and a former seafaring actress with a Bluetooth mobile phone add everything to the perfect Saturday night at home.
