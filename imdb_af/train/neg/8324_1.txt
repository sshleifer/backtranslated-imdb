First, the big listed actors need the money ... The surgical scenes were laughing .... and surely they should know that people who have some knowledge of medicine will find it completely absurd. ... Anesthesiologists should not leave the room during a heart transplant .... nor do they do the operation in a small room without instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not story line does not focus Due to all the silly operation scenes ... no blood, no staff and then the hero doc comes in and takes over ... this is not a movie to think of adults .... Also budget should have been limited ... the street scenes were OK, but who was the technical advisor .... It looks like a total idiot. Save your money and wait until it comes to DVD and don't rent it.
