"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very poor movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer shooting arrows in people. Mira has an Italian accent that falls from time to time. Couldn't she speak English? All the other characters have a forced Mexican English accent that is distracting. The dialogue is very bad and its delivery is wood. The cinematography looks nice, but it's not enough to save this test. THIS NEXT PART OF THIS OVERVIEW KEEP SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, the villain seems to get away, but then he comes back down stairs to shoot and a cool stunt. It just shows that this script has no originality whatsoever. AVOID!
