We watched it twice in the theater because we couldn't believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we missed something ... no, what missed, was missed from the start of pre-production. I actually returned to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting in the day, is just as disconnected and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> So, the initial problem with the movie decided not to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck got there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful outdoor photography is steamed by random camera placement in indoor shots. All the actors seem at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively in love - except Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too oblivious to realizing how terrible her performance really is. This dialogue is one, long, uncompromising circle. Scenes do not make sense from second to second, and the connection between them is non-existent. And yet the movie flashes blindly, convinced it says something profound. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to even be funny; it is simply unbearable. Gus Van Zant did other good films that I encourage you to watch, and I am glad that he survived (and apparently learned) this litter.
