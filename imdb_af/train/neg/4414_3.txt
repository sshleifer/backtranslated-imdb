Christopher Durang had to be taught by a memorably dreadful nun, because he just couldn't leave the concept. The play, "Sister Mary Ignatius, explains it all to you," was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone of voice as Diane Keaton's lesson parts here. Sister Maria was an exaggeration, a lampon, a bitter satire of a very confident, doctrinal and highly judgmental nun - and, as played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration seriously - while retaining the same tone in the "explain everything" scenes. The two approaches clash mainly and in the last twenty minutes the movie goes off the track, sliding it into the gorge and exploding. There are no survivors. It could have been if the plays with the four alumni, and their encounter with Sister Maria, were the same as the Sister Mary scenes. Or if the sister Maria's scene is presented more realistically. This way simply doesn't work.
