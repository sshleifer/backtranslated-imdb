(David H. Steinberg )'s writing initially had some clever points that could make good romantic comedy, but BUT BUT, oh dear! What ever happened in the road ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. It was originally (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it was a long time ago, but these are the pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre: the rough teenage comedy. Then came the 1990s. After the important cases affected, I had a lot of hits (like Probleemkind - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996) and (Something About Mary - 1998) what I think slackers is influenced by, there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era, the only one: (American Pie - 1999), which is undoubtedly and incomparably a genre's icon. Then I think every comedy of that kind should be so dirty, cum laude nasty, to be admired by the youth, otherwise it might be out of fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe that (Slackers) is a clever plot first as a script, then its creators have made a huge amount of: rudeness, filth, strange shameless sex - on those days - so easily like pie! As they had to fill every scene with free elements such as: masturbation, oral sex, urination, etc. Just to look low. They are completely unnecessary elements for the story, but surely it is so necessary to make the profit, and to get the latest fashion to make teenage comedies. The problem is in how it has already replaced a possible comedy in it. <br /> <br /> Some of his moments literally looked awful, and that's how you see the point. It's all in (Jason Schwartzman's) appearance and performance; memorably disgusting to the extreme. So the ambition has changed from that romantic comedy to the making of what has not been done before of pure blow moldings. To be more like an abomination where you ask all the time; What would nastier do? (vomiting, speed, etc.); It's the easiest combination to make a comedy. <br /> <br /> Although, even if you hate it, you need to love something (mostly to be fat). For me it was just Gina Gershon cameo's scene. Anyway, they designed it as a whole to be offenses for the scan, such as an adolescent's naughty dream. Although most of them were close to someone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What made me sad was that this one in its core was a real potential job, not another cheap one, another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be . . Please remember the details of stealing the exam (the first 2 minutes), so the movie's main plot (weirdo try to reach a girl by extortionate cool guys) by the pattern of (boy loves girl and girl is love another boy), this is nothing but an overtlock. It dealt with its material, the smallish bunch of dirty college boys, who had nothing to do, but would do mawkish quip out of anything. It ended and it is a pity to say it, a smiling k * t! <br /> <br /> In the end, it said something (can you imagine!) About the time and place for the cheater or the slack to win, quite like this comedy itself. It sounds good to yet another better movie; that can ensure my opinion of this one as clever one. Once! And it doesn't take much to understand that these film makers were the right slackers! Perhaps stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if .. The final result here was not at least spiritual by any means. <br /> <br /> PS: The scriptwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote the story of (American Pie 2), has a main page at the IMDb where you find the "Additional Details" his usual " Plot Keywords "What is: Sex / Vulgarity / Raw Humor / ... They just forgot to write Urine while making up 70-year-old women!
