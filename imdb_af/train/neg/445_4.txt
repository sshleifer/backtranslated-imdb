One thing that amazed me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who believes he is the lead writer on the subject of the Rosenstrap, was one of the historians working on this film. Many of the real events have been changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she never intended Lena to cover Goebbels, but in which case, why did she give every impression that it had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for man's release, such as the disaster Stalingrad was, or the Nazis' fear that the international press, based in Berlin, would find out about the protest. <br /> <br /> Also, why did the whole story play the second story for a poor family relationship story that has been repeated over and over? Surely something as fantastic as it can carry its own history! In places it was as if the film had two story lines that really had little in common. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed in its purpose, which had to draw attention to a little known act of resistance, which is a shame because it was done better, it can have a big impact .
