This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success the Italian "Spaghetti" westerners have enjoyed and, as characteristic of such genre efforts, consist of a eclectic variety of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, this cohesive mess of a movie serves as a shining example of why most Americans of movie genres have become a dying race in the 1970s and are currently extinct (or officially?) Extinct. <br /> <br /> I really didn't want this movie just because of the western one of my favorite types of movies, but also because it has all the features, including an intriguing premise, to be a good one - not to speaks of the fact that my dad bought a paperback edition of a TOWN CALLED BASTARD's novellation following his original relieve! As it is, the only virtue of the film (if it can even be called it) is its eccentricity: for example, Stevens, who gives a widow vengeance on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps inside a coffin . !) driven by her dumb man in a cart (?) Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty apostate, who initially appears to be the main villain of the film, is sent very early in the picture by his own accomplice Lettieri. The villain of the piece then seems to be Landau who is seen in the first scene of the movie, next to our legendary hero-turned priest Shaw! Fernando Rey, who is a blind farmer, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw, who is ultimately just a front for ... well, never, no! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and strangers from there! The production team responsible for this film was also behind other Western rates in the same period, such as CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
