* Spoilers and extreme bashing lie ahead. <br /> <br /> When this show started for the first time, I found it tolerant and fun. Quite Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults wanted. It also had high ratings with Spongebob. But it started to fall due to the next crap that Butch Hartman and his team moved into the show. <br /> <br /> Firstly, toilet humor is not that funny. You can easily pull a quick laugh from a small child with a hump, but it's actually the only audience that will laugh at such a clich√© joke. Next are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear, and we can see people cross-decorating. Lololol !!! I just can't stop laughing with such gay bliss! Someone's helping me! But of course this show would not be so bad if it wasn't for stereotypes. Did you see the team portray the Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons living in a hot desert. But now ... The coup is the grace of WHY this show really sucks the hardest of them all ... HOW TO USE JOKES !!! The show constantly makes the same jokes (most of them are unfunny) think it's like the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is usually the one who blames it. I hated how they kept on mentioning "Super Toilet" (which also contains a mixture of humor in it) and Cosmo will freak out. And who can joke the blunt battery ram that every older parent in Dimmsdale would use that email section? Do you know the one in which every single parent (unaware of other parents to say so) will explain the EXACT the same sentence before breaking into their child's room? Yes, it may be first class humor for some, but it is pure for others. <br /> <br /> If I'm not wrong, I believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone in my area says it is, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show ever. I just can't agree with that? I think it's just another pile of horseback we get every day on our cartoon stations, just worse.
