It is an OK movie, but has no real depth, emotional or storytelling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on actual events and it limits the amount of action to virtually nothing, no real tension either. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible in the lead but he sleeps through it, there is no room to bend any muscles for him or the supporting role. <br /> <br /> The story simply falls a little flat, even without hearing the title character, the end was obvious, but unlike other movies about such injustices, this one has no emotional impact, you give Not really for him and the motivation of those outside help looks more academically than worried about his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to use some emotion by using the boy outside, whose hero Carter worships, but seems forced. <br /> <br /> It's an OK movie, but immediately forgotten. .
