ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and it shows the direction in which it is necessarily entered. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) are in front and center. The rest of the player will also just beat the clock and collect their checks. The series will once again come to the event and its moments, but a deadly decline has occurred. <br /> <br /> Throughout the series, Lewis Stone will continue to portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic way. The rest of the cast will be professional though it is given less and less. Mickey Rooney on the other hand will continue his character as if there was no learning curve. Andy's reaction to any situation was in a naive and incredible way. Even after returning as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), his response to any "teapot storm" was the same, youthful. <br /> <br /> In this movie it is clearly illustrated. ANDY finds itself in several incredible situations that could be solved with a simple explanation. This author writing device was known as the 'idiot plot'. A way to extend a poorly written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys fault than the Director and the Writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz was aiming too much and a tighter hand was needed to control Rooney's remains. To see our review of the whole series, YOUR FIRST GO ON YOU once (1937).
