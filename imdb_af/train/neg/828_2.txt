Let's look. In the "St Elsewhere" final, we realized that there was no hospital and that everything was in the minds of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended by telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended by telling you that everything in her mind had happened. Very "creative". Irritating was more like that. Yes, it was just a TV program and was not a reality at all. It's just that when you're caught up in a big movie or TV show, you end up at least believing it's all "really". At least as far as the reality it portrays on the screen. This kind of series finals was done twice before and was cute, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. Now, "Newhart" is everything a dream? At least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. The idea itself wasn't too captivating, but it was done so brilliantly that it was probably the best series of finals ever. Roseanne made me deceive after being such a loyal fan.
