WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they dress like Black Chicks, oh yes, they will not look any different. Can anyone give me a Wayans movie where they are not dressed as ladies? Don't be a threat, don't write Jack White and Michael Costanza Ghost. (The other Norton Trio members acted as directors.) <br /> <br /> There are no jokes in White Chicks. It's just the Wayans who act like girls for 2 hours. There are no options, no punchlines and no laughs. There are many "I think I'm going to play a time crisis 3." At least for me there were 5 times to be exact. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented one), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. , and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. The only thing that hurts the O-Zone is low. <br /> <br /> COVER 1/2 * from ****
