It's just Robert De Niro's movie that I really hate. It's a stupid movie with horrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to do his mafia movies as always as Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro also worked twice with Palma, greetings and wedding party. I also said that the wedding party was also good (I didn't look greetings). <br /> <br /> Screen game is really bad and unique. There is no scene I can smile for once. Movie has lost a chance to be a funny style, even a bit in a "Be Black Baby" scene, and I don't like the scene where a man's sexual organ has appeared. So, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! not the worst. I hate it.
