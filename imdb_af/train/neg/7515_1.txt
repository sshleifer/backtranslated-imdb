Suck. That's all I have to say about this sorry excuse for a movie. Suck. Suck. Suck. I mean, how hell did they think? The involved idiots should never be allowed to make another movie. The acting was so bad it didn't even entertain at a bad level. The attempt at a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This movie sucks! Suck! Struggle! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about a successor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
