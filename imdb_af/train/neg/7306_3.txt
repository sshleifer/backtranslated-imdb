Actually one of the worst movies I've ever put. I have never actually taken the time to write one of these, but I have been forced to look at this coaching for film production and feel somewhat surprised to waste my time on such a turd to be honest. There were so many parts that satisfied me with their complete randomness and lack of sense (eg when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When would hospitals ever come through such people for lack of healing? He spied on his wife while he ran a gun while she rolled around on the bed?). Also, the characterization - as we expected almost in such films - was terrible (eg the way the blonde guy - I don't remember his fresh name and anyway - didn't turn up - turned completely against his girlfriend and ran away to leaving her) and I ended up having to meet all creepy ends! The production was terribly irreconcilable and the cinematography had nothing to write about the house.
