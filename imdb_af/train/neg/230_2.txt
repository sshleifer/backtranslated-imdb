It was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wood she makes a rocking horse, looks like a better job. But remember that it turns into Four Weddings, equally ominous. Another film depicting England as full of chocolate kitchen houses, and village green. I mean that school, how many schools, except maybe Hogwarts, look like that? The two police station looked like the set of Heartbeat (a nauseous British series in the 60's). This movie just couldn't imagine what it wanted - a comedy or a serious investigation into the downfall of women's friendships. If it was held to the former, the graveyard could only have worked sex and the very stupid storm of the wedding (I just say). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it unlikely that Kate will ever talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. A final note - what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell must adhere to advertising chrome.
