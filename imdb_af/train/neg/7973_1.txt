I go to many movies, often I bring my 5 year old son, I'm so glad I didn't bring him to this one. There are many references to sex and a shining baptism, but that is not the primary reason I would not take it. The trailers lead you to believe it is a light-hearted comedy; Yet, almost all the funny moments are in the forefront. I was waiting for it to be interesting, funny or something else than serious; However, I almost fell asleep as the plot-less story dragged. I understand that dogs can be a good company, for that reason, the whole story focused on a poorly behaved dog that the owners were not adequately trained to train. If one had so much damage and abuse, that person would be banned. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is a waste of their talent. The best way to summarize this movie is to find a couple who get unfair dog, couple fall in love with the dog, dog die, couple are sad. The end.
