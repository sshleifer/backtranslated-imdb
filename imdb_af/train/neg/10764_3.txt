I will give author / director William Gove credit to find someone to fund this bad pregnant "thriller". A good argument for wasting money on HBO, let alone cover art and blurbs-based DVDs. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco does not add anything significant to their resume, although the art is not halfway. The dialogue will surprise you with wonder at his mind; this is the storytelling at its worst. No tension, no tension, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, nothing. A few attractive and often naked women rush the boredom, but it is definitely a movie that is best seen as a trailer. I feel sorry for the man who made this thing green. Good for late night zoned views. You're warned.
