This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect fake woman role of Lane. They changed the second half of the film to fit for the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then, the movie has full traces of unreliable, though it couldn't catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn from the Bollywood enthusiasts, where Mallika displayed much more skin than risked at all. Emran had more roles like this and was even the serial killer. In the future, if the Indian directors plan to retrieve an English film, they should investigate the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors received the improper recognition. In the future, the directors should be a little more careful to recall an Oscar nominated film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's not a family movie, so be extra careful watching the family at home.
