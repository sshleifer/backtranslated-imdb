I enjoyed a lot of Margaret Atwood's novel The Robber Bride, and I was excited to see there was a movie version. A woman makes a police spokesman for her own murder and his friend, a former journalist, tries to clear his name by looking at the deadly woman's crazy female friends. It is fortunate that the film screenplay Mrs. Atwood's clumsy plans rectify by focusing on the story of these two men, the victims of dusk women. <br /> <br /> Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they were made completely for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting unless we see that they happen to a man, and a man's life is broken up. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - to a man. Because it's not important if a man doesn't hear it. <br /> <br /> I like the characters in the book. It hurts to see that they are being pushed to the side for a man's story. I'm not usually looking for feminist corners on the media, and I've been trying to enjoy the movie as it is. If I didn't read the book, I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the police and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're not happy. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy nice prose and characterization that is subtly laid by a plot. It's the same plot: the movie burst it out, ironed it and sprinkled it with male anxiety. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
