Good deaths. Good Mask. Cool Ax. Good looking girls .... But watch out !!! No plot and small barely completely lower it standards. They tried to make an "I know what you did last summer" but eventually made a "Scream". But Hey, what do people expect from a horror movie? Answers completely different. Rent it if you want, but I'm sorry I ever see it.
