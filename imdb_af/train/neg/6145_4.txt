Although I saw "Gymkata" in a theater back in '85, I couldn't remember anything about the plot except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment at the end. <Br /> <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I picked up a copy of the new-born DVD to re-enter the gymkata world. <br /> <br /> It seems that this is one of those movies that goes directly to the video during the 80's today. The movie star champion gymnast Kurt Thomas and Jonathan Cabot, who were recruited from the blue to infiltrate the "Parmistan" nation to enter the "The Game" and hopefully win. A suicide blood sponsor sponsored by the Khan, encouraging his people by shouting what sounds "Yak Power." The mission of the mission is to defend the Star Wars. Jonathan is trained by Princess Rubali in martial arts, who never speak or leave home. Once trained, try mixing with the locals by wearing a bright red and white striped jersey. Needless to say Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the pebbled streets of Parmistan, heading for a fateful date and game. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas was sick by director Robert Clouse, who looks like it, was never on the set. The so-called writing is just this side of incompetent. See other reviews for the many cryers throughout. The town of crazies has a few good moments, but is eventually ruined by the bad editing. The end ... meh. Yet there is the germ of a good action adventure here. A Hong Kong version with more visceral action and faster fit may even be pretty good.
