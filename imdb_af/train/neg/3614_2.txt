A schizophrenia escaped from a NYC mental hospital and soon teachers at St. Trinity University. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) is dealing with the mess of red herring. In spite of a 78 minute run, this cheap-o-slasher pulls on and off to the cripple finish where the person you suspect the killer is coming from, seems to be like that. Director Richard Haines barely breaks a sweat with a little stem-n-slash staging, but delivers the horror that was heard in the early 80's. For all our amateur anthropologists, it was filmed in New Yawk in the early 80's, so you can check out all the cultures, beliefs and customs of the distant people. The movie gets some credit to leave the "Final Girl". You rarely see it. Also, always enjoy watching a horror movie where a priest is the murderer. Don't you trust the clergy, my beloved movie industry? Fortunately, this one is just a false priest and he is caught. He still works the moral high ground.
