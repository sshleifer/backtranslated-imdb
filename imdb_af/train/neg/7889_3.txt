I just finished watching this movie. It wasn't ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed with it. I'm not really sure why anyone would make such a movie. It was marginally entertaining, but I feel that the people who made it had a lot of disagreement about what they were doing. The author was in control on Monday; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; etc. It almost seems that they really wanted to make a few different movies, but just had the time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Someone else said the play was really good, but I didn't agree. Then again, if the actors could hold a straight face during filming, they might be better actors than I recognize them. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery ... something according to the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure. It starts like that, but then it is off nowhere, it takes a turn to a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or ... what was that other show that wasn't that good? A bad episode of the outer limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it's just as played out. There is the evil man with speckled white hair. There is the love interest that, when she first appears, actually blows the wind through her hair. Seriously. Once you realize it's a Christian movie, the end is also pretty easy to see. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was poorly done, especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward. It wasn't terrifying for most of the movie, but sometimes there was a ridiculous bad shot from an old lady, praying, arms in a dark room while lightning was striking - the kind of thing that just bit you embarrassed turn around Watch the movie.
