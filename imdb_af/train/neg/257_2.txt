I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see. <br /> <br /> I walked out of this one. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit it might have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back theater, who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie knocks on a door! HOW HE HAVE ! "), But .. It was just as incredibly annoying. There can be no continuous camera shot and no camera shot at a conventional angle ... everything must be in your face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad man tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point it's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you've seen, too much you've heard before, and too many "difficult old" lines ... and I don't care about that kind of thing, really, as long as there's a little bit of originality to it. In fact, the whole supporting role just sucked. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie ... but not nearly funny enough to endure everything else. <br /> <br /> This movie needs less shooting-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave it a 2.
