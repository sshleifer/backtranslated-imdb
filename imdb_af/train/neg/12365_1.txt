I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all the American animators think the kids nowadays want stupid GI JOE versions of good stories ??? the Looney Tunes are among the beloved characters in history, but they are not created to be Xtreme, I mean come! Tiny Toons was a good example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that just want to create a cheap idiotic show that children love, because hey !! ! kids love superheroes right ??? the whole show is just a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes, but this time in superhero form, it doesn't sound too bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to reach ranges like batman the animated series, or the new justice league, the result ??? bad copies of flash (the road runner) or superman (who else ??? Bugs Bunny) The problem is that Looney Tunes wasn't meant to be dramatic, it was supposed to be funny !! as I said before this series sucks, and many people wonder why anime is taking worldwide? This show tries to be dramatic and action-packed, but it is something that can do a few series and anime, if you want to see a good upgrade from an old show look Tiny Toons, it's an example that it's possible to go back bring to life. old characters, but with a good story and respect for the original roots. too bad the show is already dead, another corporate way decides what I suppose.
