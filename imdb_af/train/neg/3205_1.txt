I see from the comments that most people discussing this movie base their comment on the MST3K airlift. It's fair enough (it's how it had its widest exposure), but since I had the misfortune to see "Final Justice" in its original form, I just wanted to make a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version. <br /> <br /> First, it must be acknowledged that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, mainly due to a performance between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I can use the characters' names instead from the actors', but I just like to type the words "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why Venantini's fleeting character can't just leave Malta immediately. (It's not a very CONVINCE plot point, but at least the filmmakers try to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut in time or because it didn't provide much rice, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Another plot point is missing in the original: The traitor's betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, who is apparently unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by an earlier, very unpleasant scene in which Venantini raped her in the shower. While giving her a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is just really ... icky. (There is no other word for that.) <br /> <br /> Some of the MST-worthy moments (the eternally rejected calls of "Sun or a--" and the "deja vu" shootings of the sheriff) were pure The result of the print-for-TV edition they worked on was absent from the original film. <br /> <br /> One of my desires made it into the MST3K version: Before you enter the bar to question some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese police officer who accompanies him to stay outside, because "They see the uniform, they won't work together." But, Joe Don himself wears his ridiculous cowboy slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! I can't imagine why they had succeeded on that great occasion to enjoy him ... <br /> <br /> A final comment on the original, uncut version of "Final Justice": Why, oh, why did do they feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's bare buttocks on the screen?
