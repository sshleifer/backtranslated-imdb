I watched this movie, based on the very favorable reviews I read here by others. <br /> <br /> They certainly saw something in this movie I didn't see, sure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a good fit, and the first 15 or 20 minutes is interesting, then it starts to be signed in and thin, and not quite incredible. <br /> <br /> Eventually you find yourself saying, "What?!? He'll do it too? How far does he go with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum's character, John, going into a deli to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new shop clerk, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets into the ambulance and goes to the hospital. It looks a bit, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John is completely obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make sense, John, who has a very good life, has a beautiful, loving friend, a safe, well-paying job, nice home, nice car, expensive packs - Decides he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose, and experiences life in a low paying job, in a dump with a brave girl and possible connections with dangerous people. Why this dim-witted, half-baked movie has favorable reviews I will never know. Probably Goldblum does a good job - he always does it - and his appearance has improved with age - but if you don't have a big imagination with Jeff Goldblum and every movie he sees, I won't see this turkey not recommended. It's about two hours of your life, you're not going to come back - and believe me - you won't be grateful if the two hours are over, except to be grateful, you're not there to watch this movie yet. ! <br /> <br />
