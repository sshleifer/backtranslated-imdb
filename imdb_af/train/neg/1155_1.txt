never before did a movie drive me to write a review, but it was just dire. I got stuck with trying to find what it was about this snoop movie which was its first serious role, but frankly it was a poor choice. made a good book, but it certainly did not work for me as a movie. I found it incredible, lacking atmosphere and I found many of the scenes far away. A musical maestro, he may be a serious actor. by Dylan Mcdermott and Rose Byrne was wise, but not enough to carry a poor plot with poor dialogue. Maybe I just missed the point, but for me it didn't fit in any genre, it did not elicit empathy with the characters, and it didn't create any tension either. In fact, I prayed and prayed for the end to slap all three main characters!
