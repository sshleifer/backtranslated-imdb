Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. This is a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times in many films. What sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it handles racism in the most ham-fined and predictable way. Oh yes, it's also in college. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with this problem of racism as Frankenstein is dealing with the most problems, it is brutally and sluggishly fixed over the head repeatedly. Most characters are cartoonistic, one-dimensional caricatures (lesbian feminists, angry black men) who respond to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defending stereotypes, this movie is overpopulated with them. The malignant black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, and so on. (A feminist even has a sign that reads: "Dead men don't rape." See what I mean?) I don't want to give anything, but watching this movie as someone like a shifty wage or a date rapist, they will probably act exactly how you expect them. The changes that the characters are making seem to everyone obvious, but the people in the movie. The big twist in the plot depends on whether the violent neo-Nazis will act like violent neo-Nazis. I'll guess you just have to look to find out what's happening. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this movie is that it is supposed to be "eager" and "hard-hit", but they make Nazis the bad guys. I agree Nazis are angry, but that's my point. Everyone thinks Nazis are bad; We don't break new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s. The film does not dispute any views or make bold statements. It's just about issues we all know in a clumsy, after school, special way. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazis does not take a difficult stance on a contentious issue. <br /> <br /> Higher learning is predictable, cartoon, and in a word stupid. Avoid at all costs.
