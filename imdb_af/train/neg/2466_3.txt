For the past few years there has been a vogue for often non-ironic-zombie-related films, as well as other media incarnations of the fleshly revived dead. "Fido" is a movie that either attempts to pay for it, merely a manifestation of it or both - and it actually falls into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we see the undead in the contrasting context of a broad stereotype, squeaky clean alternative history (we are in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now dominated by slaves) version of a 1950's suburb . <br /> <br /> It's a moderate funny concept alone and enough for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can't stop a movie itself. The joke cheating bodies for people is uncomfortable. This idealized version of a small town is repeated repeatedly, losing all efficiency. The soundtrack plays indifferently sunny songs, while zombies cannibalize bystanders. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiar domestic line for a cheap attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The vastness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here cannot help but irritate me. It is so styled, it is obvious, "Pleasantville" inspired, that it is more visible in the blazing markers of its 1950s, but actually has a similarity to anything that happened between 1950 and 1959. about it, as if the movie is fun and unthinkable about the more open, down-to-earth and superior the 2000s are. <br /> <br /> Because the characters are such a broad representation of pop culture 1950s "types", it is difficult to develop a lot of emotional investment in them. Everyone has a few traits that are thrown at him or her. Helen is obsessive with appearances, and Bill loves golf and his ghost killed his father. But they remain fairly two-dimensional. Performances within the limitations of this bad writing are good. The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" actually gives character and sympathy to a crippling green monster who can't speak. <br /> <br /> There are little pieces of unpaid allegory thrown - to commodity fetishism, racism, classics, war paranoia, and so on, but nothing works right at a comprehensive level, and the filmmakers don't really mind anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not really pass the sticky joke of "Look! Zombies in 'Leave It to Beaver!" 'for a good hour and a half.
