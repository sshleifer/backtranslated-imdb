You want to see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. It's not that movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good commentary here seems to be written by (badly disguised) false third parties. The people who made this movie seem to be synthesizing fake interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well done. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are offensive. <br /> <br /> The movie is so temperate that I can't imagine anyone familiar with the topic finding it funny. Laughing for yourself is an important quality, but if you are that way, you will have to hate to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not offensive due to its great satire of taboo topics but due to its constant pathetic banality.
