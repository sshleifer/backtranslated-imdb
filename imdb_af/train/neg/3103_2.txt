So there is an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there is KEVIN, the world's largest wuss. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty and virgin girlfriend AMY. Returning from work to ... a random home ... he finds his "friends", the sexually confusing red-hot KEY and the really riotous DAPHNE. They will soon be with Daphne's boyfriend, the faster happy, sex-mad Macho Lunkhead NICK. And there are title creatures, terribly small dogeared puppets that kill people by giving them their heart's desire. Kyle's heart's desire is to join a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades into a nursery cafeteria. I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne is already a disgusting slut, so she does not have a heart's desire. Along the way, a really horrible band sings a strange song. The hobgoblins go back randomly to where they come from and blow. "Citizen Kane" cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema.
