<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is never a member of any club that would have me. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mom /> <br /> female vampire and is dead. She started a hankering for <br /> <br /> blood, and met John Savage and looked as if he <br /> <br /> was wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants to allow Andreef with his little vampire <br /> <br /> family, consisting of a British vampire, the blonde vamp /> <br /> attacked Starr and a green hair midget (I don't make it <br /> <br />) <br /> <br /> The family doesn't want Starr, so they try to save Savage and Kill Starr. </ br /> <br /> and Starr's child. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that it was a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his screen time with more facial techniques than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola Bender, and he reads all his lines as <br /> <br / > he made a Farrelly Brothers movie. Andreeff tries to make the most of a poorly written role, but scriptwriter / director Ruben is <br /> <br /> for all the vampire climbs, like Starr, who eats her son's pet hammer. <Br /> <br /> buy lots of raw meat to fight the urge for blood. The child <br /> <br /> is also very beaten, because those who think that violence against children is really entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is extra gory, but not in game, over the top way like "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue." Here the gore is coarse and never justified, it just doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> It's just in the budget. Most of the R rating goes to Andreeff's <br /> <br /> colleagues, who are placed in the <br /> <br /> conversational background of embarrassment slips. The budget doesn't include <br /> <br /> vampire rings! All the vampires here have to prey on eating. <br /> <br /> Nifty idea unless you've seen George Romero's <br /> <br /> Martin. <br /> <br /> Even at 77 minutes, and if you throw in Ruben's efforts in <br /> <br /> art direction (skewed frames, faded screens), it is worthwhile, tiring, dirty and vuilritte. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual <br /> <br /> violence, strong gore, strong curse, female nudity, sexual <br /> <br /> referrals, drug abuse and adult situations. <br /> <br />
