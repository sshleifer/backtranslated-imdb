That this poor excuse for an amateur hour show at Sundance was voiced is a good example of what most indie filmmakers are wrong today. <br /> <br /> First, there is something like the art of cinematography. Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing to whoever has a line doesn't make for a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we should consider ourselves happy, the director didn't pick up someone's video camera ... <br /> <br /> Second, movies are supposed to be about real people . There is nothing really in this movie. None of the characters appear as even a man at a distance. <br /> <br /> What happened to them is figs from the imagination of a writer trying to impress his friends by showing how "cool and edgy" he is. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but it's not good writing or directing. <br /> <br /> What remains is a screen of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance. It's hard to believe it's one of the best-anticipated films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it has lost me what remains of my respect for the Sundance brand.
