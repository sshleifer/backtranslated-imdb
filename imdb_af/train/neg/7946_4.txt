one thing boring. <br /> <br /> The young demi looks good, but she is pregnant (- point before = D) the movie is not scary ... <br /> <br /> the first scenes I have a looked a little crappy, i could deliver better clouds with my laptop, and after effects. but it was then ... and now it is. some movies don't get old ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> Not worth renting or buying ... get something better instead of the exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> next = D <br /> < br /> oh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor = D
