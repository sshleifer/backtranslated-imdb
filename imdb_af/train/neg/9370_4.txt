Although it's not a "big movie", there's something compelling and memorable about it. Like another on the film, I saw it in childhood. It's been thirty-three years since 1952, but I've never forgotten the story or its ridiculous cumbersome title. See it if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of the small town living as it evolved through the decades. More than any other film, this one human face brings to the historical drama of the early twentieth century's "progress". It's enough to make enough for a young viewer and remember an older one. Furthermore, it's easy to keep the characters and watch their way through time.
