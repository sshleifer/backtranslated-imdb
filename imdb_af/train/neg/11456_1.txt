This is one of those movies that makes you think: Hulk "The Real American" Hogan did the same? Frankly, I don't think so and he would have been right. I'm Italian, I can't be proud of my country for many reasons, but I wouldn't have touched another team (for example, the French) just because I am in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition to the protagonist, a British girl is not in love with the end of the movie, but with a compatriot, so why row it against Yale. As far as the actor is concerned, all the players do very poorly. And then, you know, I hated the "dead poets community" atmosphere. In fact, it's another movie I hate.
