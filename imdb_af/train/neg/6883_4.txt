I was from Puertorican descent, had mixed fillings on this "documentary". First, I was offended by me. Perez Senor Campos in Che Guevarra compared. Just a fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent. His parents came from Columbia. Who did research on this was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race is based on education. This message had to be covered throughout the movie. Education is our path to freedom and power. I think any future efforts by this production team should make this focus. According to me, this movie has been turned to an anti-American sentiment.
