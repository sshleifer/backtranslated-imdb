We had to be suspicious of discovering that we were only two minutes light, we were alone. Only five others started the movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to release this movie. The acting is terrible (especially Hurley). The writing is banal. The effects we've seen a million times. The movie is the worst we've seen. Meandering and disagreement. No one laughed at the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been earlier if my wife didn't go for a hot dog! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to look at your cinema, buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch people watch. You'll have a much nicer time! <br /> <br />
