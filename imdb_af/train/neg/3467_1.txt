The cover of the box of this movie has Kyle Minogue's name on it, but she did the same fate as Drew Barrymore in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this movie lame; they are trying to market a movie with someone in there in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie feature should have young hip-college kids unaware that there is a killer. To conclude all this, Molly Ringwald of 80's teenage movie celebrity is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a great career move for Molly to make money to make a crappy movie in Australia so she won't get rid of in the states. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this dumb movie is about a stupid horror movie that's never finished, because this dumb creature kills everyone in it. Throughout the film we have to guess who the killer is. Long story short, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or does she? <br /> <br /> This move is just bad, rent it if you feel tortured or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Don't spread the horror.
