<br /> <br /> Believe me, you won't mind. <br /> <br /> With a title like Splatter University, one would immediately gather that this movie is not a high art. But worse than Splatter University doesn't even qualify for the amusing rubbish. Splatter You are so weak - the story is pointless, the characters are throw-aways, and the whole movie has no essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no tension or atmosphere or fear. This drive is not even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest of all). So, everything around this endless flawed skater offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even cheap laughter) and just becomes a complete drill. Bottom of the barrel people - even dying hard treasure fans will think twice before watching, let alone pay money for this movie. <br /> <br /> BOMB from ****
