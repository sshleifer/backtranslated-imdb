I confess that I have an awkward feeling about ghost movies, and sometimes I enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really must be crazy to be funny. "About her dead body" seems to take a bit too much for life, and I think I think almost any aspect I can think of. Of course, the story is totally incredible and has failed to convince me either in the cartoon or in the sentimental register. Choosing the lead roles was terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least attractive and looks like a nice guy, it seems that the taste in ladies of his character needs serious improvement, as Eva Longoria is too old for him, and Lake Bell looks too unattractive. A romantic story without good reason for romance is due to failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but they only had roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing is really worth watching, nothing to remember.
