Hollywood does it again. Much money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you're not on the latest stupid pop culture, you'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a logbook and do nothing more than this movie will offer. <br /> <br />
