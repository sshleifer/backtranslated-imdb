I also watched this movie, and although it did very well, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend women who have small children. The terror on the face of this mother when she sees her child being attacked by a train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is: internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world she makes to make dolls doesn't hide the sadness she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulled money out of her clothes to try to heal her child. I'm surprised this movie is taking place in Detroit, because when I looked at it, I thought people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also a route for the poor from the mountains.
