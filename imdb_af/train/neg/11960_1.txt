I actually retired from Asian horror movies after I got sick of seeing the same ghost story. However, I have been getting more and more in exploitation cakes recently, and so decided to give them another chance. My first port was highly rated director Takashi Miike's highly rated Visitor Q. I've seen Audition, and while I didn't like that much, I consider it to be one of the better modern Asian horror movies. So, I made it with sensible expectations; and unfortunately only boredom was found. I think this movie is really clever and it just went over my head, but what seemed to me was just a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no connection between them. Any comparisons with Luis Bunuel and David Lynch's work are blaspheming. All Miike did here, make a movie; Any intelligence around it was implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache lasted about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't fall until the movie finally ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and are actively looking for the most notorious movies; but while it is violent, it is senseless and boring and I did not get one gram of pleasure from it. Takashi Miike can have many fans, but I'm definitely not one of them; and I certainly hope it's the last time I come into contact with one of his films.
