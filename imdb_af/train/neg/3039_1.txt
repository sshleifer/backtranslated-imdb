I can always tell when something will be a hit. I see it or hear it and get a good feeling. I didn't have a good feeling to watch the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this movie, and I am not surprised at being considered one of the worst 100 movies here. I'm really proven. <br /> <br /> The first thing that threw me off was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I'm black on the road), but for a movie they could use a better title, and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think the dance movie theme is overdoing. At least, "You Got Served" was better than that in my opinion. Even the soundtrack didn't make me excited.
