Never throw models and Playboy bunnies in your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich had enough obsession to marry her SISTER after marrying her low-life husband, is a million times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen . Patty Hansen is not an actress either. I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece, a la Orson Welles, but instead Audrey Hepburn did cavorting in jeans and god-horrible poodlesque hair. Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could look at time and time again. I could barely pierce this clunker once. This movie is allegedly not released because of the brouhaha around Mrs. Stratten's dead death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
