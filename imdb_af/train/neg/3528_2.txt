There is so much comment on this movie, but I found them to be misleading. It is an angular, over-exploited scenario where a normal person becomes a partner in crime for someone of the opposite sex, without a clear reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holds boy on gun for something ridiculous. Boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> You know the drill: The antagonist seems to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath. Put a few words of wisdom out of Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's, is she crazy or does she just need a hug? 'role of The Breakfast Club, just like a main character. And all that remains is a real horrible turkey of a movie.
