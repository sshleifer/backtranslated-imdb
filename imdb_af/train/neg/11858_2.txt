I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I stumbled upon - is absolutely unnecessary. I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one to check her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all these plays. Given how expensive it is to film in New York today, I wonder how it was made in the first place. And if you wonder why I didn't watch it at all, it came to a movie I wanted on the cable and I turned it on while working at the computer. It's not a very demanding picture!
