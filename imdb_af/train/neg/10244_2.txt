I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing distant about the character Michael J. Fox-# 1 played, we just don't walk around with our bags featuring theater tickets and $ 100- accounts do not burst! # 2 If I ever allow anyone to use for a lunch delight, I'll be fired on the spot! The organization I belong to (Les Clefs d'Or) has very clear standards of ethics and behavior that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly, at the end of the movie, the concept of Doug was simply to remove its golden key badge and hand it over to another employee. We deserve the keys and it is a weapon of honor and knowledge to be allowed to carry them. There is a whole application and beating process to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This movie does nothing to waste the unfortunate perception of a porter as nothing but a valid mercenary. In short, this makes our organization dissatisfied. I welcome any comments.
