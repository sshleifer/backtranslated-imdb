I watched this movie yesterday and although I didn't have much hope for this movie, I was still very disappointed! I really can't believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The storyline was shameful and the acting was terrible (although it had great names like Uma Thurman in it). This movie was heavily dependent on its special effects ... but they had no effect on me personally. I honestly wish that id never looked at it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this movie. This is a total waste of money and you will only be disappointed later. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, entertain yourself, don't look and watch this movie. You will live to regret it!
