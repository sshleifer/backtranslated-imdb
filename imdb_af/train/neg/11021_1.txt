Hallam Foe tells us the story of a boy who lost his mother and then experienced a kind of Oedepus complex. <br /> <br /> It's like 95 minutes, but will be better in ten. There is an hour in the middle where he climbs on the roofs, and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic). There is a strange love story involved that doesn't "I have nothing to do with anything. She looks like his mother, yes, what? We know he misses his mother, it's the first ten minutes. They just had to start and ended and it was an O.K. short film. Now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change. He is a guy who does things. The only active choice he has in the middle of the film is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There is this whole Oedepus thing that is about to analyze our character. He paints his face, wears clothes and wears a dead scarf on his head. A badger! You must see the end! He returns to his home with the tie on his head (and it is shot like a tough Horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (of which he had sex in the beginning). And somehow they thought it wouldn't be enough entertainment, so they put punk music in the background. However, I have to admit, I'm kind of allergic to movies that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. It feels like this MacKenzie director / guy / we are also trying to show that he also studies psychology at school. You're so smart! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! You really dug! What a Wallraf! Well, now I realize that this movie is based on a random book, but anyway. <br /> <br /> Photoism is boring. Lots of talking heads. Plus the editor changed the colors from scene to scene, you know cold and hot, etc. Why? maybe "Hallam Foe" is both a function and a test film for color blind. Or maybe they just thought that the drama would not be enough to tell us that he was feeling lonely, so they turned blue so we really got it. <br /> <br /> I won't even comment on the cliché. indie-oh-how-to-like drawings made in the presentation. And all the "cute" sex events are going on. This whole movie is an independent cliché. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Although it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crazy this one gets through the machine.
