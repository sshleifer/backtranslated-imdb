I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical, and the whole idea was a frost of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a sneaky girl who is sent to a place where she doesn't belong. The whole place hates her and making things worse is a hot guy who doesn't seem to like her. Well, the whole dam school can't stand you. She finds incredibly a way to fit in and make everyone feel like making her feel. Let the old head fall over heels. Then comes the choice, where she should choose between figure skating and hockey. She picks up hockey, then goes to the skating subjects, and gets on the Olympic team. No real surprise there. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so predictable. You knew what was going to happen before you even saw it. It was so terrible that I was almost puked, and when I finished it, I had a terrible headache and the urge to shoot myself to look like a shit. Don't watch this unless you're less than ten, or actually like crappy movies.
