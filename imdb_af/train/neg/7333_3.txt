I did not enjoy opening the opening very much, but 20 minutes later I quickly applied the quick button. Too many shots from Stewart (Michael Zelniker) run from room to room, down corridors, through doors and down the street, and so many shots of him seem closer and confused. Gave me the impression that the story was originally intended as a short (20-30 minutes), and then in a function as a loving work between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they wrote the script). <Br /> <br /> It might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had something that I didn't say in many other movies before, or if the end wasn't disappointing - the one I three minutes predicted In the movie (atypical for an independent / smaller studio movie). At least his heart was in the right place - it wasn't your standard formal Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
