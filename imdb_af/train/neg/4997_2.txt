... but it's definitely not without merit. Already writer director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual movie effects to tell his stories, creating broad traits but distinctive characters and situations, and writing smart and sometimes unexpectedly and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder the Coen brothers' next movie will be a tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that the plot isn't quite there; It lacks surprise, the unexpected plots and sudden changes in prosperity that viewers suggest. The coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot, and the end is well predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing much better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, look first at "Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek". If you've seen it, go ahead and look at this one.
