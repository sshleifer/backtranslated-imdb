I hired this movie from the library (it's hard to find good reason) purely from curiosity. I'm a big Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The writing is horrible, not because it is renegade from the original new text, but because it expires without focus or intention. The screens are poorly built and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What's with the hokey voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus did little with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry is completely abused. Marilyn Hassett is totally unbelievable when Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old for the case) is partly due to casting (she was 32 during filming, Plath's age was his DIED) and partly because she couldn't act. Hassett is all emotions, no trade, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what's there, which isn't much. The only reason I give the movie a 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry Sylvia, you will have to wait for someone else to adjust your fine work to something more appropriate.
