This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I've never seen a movie worse than this one !!! <br /> <br /> AND I NEVER PAY !!!! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of "B" horror movies. As you may think .... I am exposed to the worst that the film industry offers. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this movie with its title. I mean, I will ... that a true fan of horror can't be inspired by a title like "Vampires vs Zombies"? Images of the "walking dead" struggling to dance the "evil" in my head. I thought to myself ... "I must see it" !! <br /> <br /> Well .... sorry to say .... "I wish I didn't see" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading to say the least. There were no vampires fighting the zombies. In fact, there is no plot !!!! If you wanted to ask me what this movie is about, I can honestly tell you. I have no idea! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie makes absolutely no sense! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I felt sorry for the poor they invested. money in this project because they definitely have no business sense !!!
