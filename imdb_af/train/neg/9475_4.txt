Beautifully photographed and ably performed, in general, but the writing is very spectacular. There are scenes of so much unbelief that there is no joy in watching. For example, the fact that the young lover has a twin brother is confronted with a sighing out loud. And the "emotional bulb connection" also looks clumsy. <br /> <br /> I don't know. If you have a few glasses of wine and want to relax with something nice to watch with some slack comedic scenes, this is a good movie. No great effort on the part of the viewer required. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than that.
