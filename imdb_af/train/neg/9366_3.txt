I rented Hybrid this weekend. What a disappointment! A deaf cripple attempt at a tele-movie. The man they had been sitting on was very poor and when he ran, he looked very much like eating those tiny sweets ... with his back! The wolf contacts he wore were wonderful, though I feel the actor has too much ground on them, because there was nothing threatening about his acting. The sensible American Indian Chick should be one of the most rocky, faced Hags. Talk about an acid cow! She smiled once for the whole movie, and I think it's because she had sex. The sex scene was also paralyzed. They can also make curtains if you can dig them. <br /> <br /> Last of all, it's a big pet of mine on the cover and the DVD menu, the losers digitally subscribed. cool sharp teeth on the man. They were nowhere to be seen in the movie. :(
