I watched this movie for a while (while working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins phoned his performance (but still keeps Hewitt in their screens) and Alec looks bored. Trust me about this: you should avoid this film as the plague if ever released. It seems to be going on forever, as the tired plot unfolds in a snail's pace. It is relentlessly unfunny, the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin has to go to the film school if he plans again. As far as his acting is concerned, his character is totally unlikely, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the jury's surprise makeup near the film's end is cute, but this movie is just awful.
