I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely, but it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. To the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she struggled to catch up with the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow with their understanding and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortured and beat Carmen's great sensual Habanera and turned it into a completely forgotten Brittany Spears wannabe pop song. My ears blew! And in the highest moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her in that place. Save your time, save your ears - Skip this movie!
