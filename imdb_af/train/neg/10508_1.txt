I thought the nadir of horror movie was reached with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This movie looks like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" compared to this piece of shameless, unexpected faecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie. I want to write more, but I'm still too angry that I'm a fool to spend Â£ 3, flush it. <br /> <br /> And were these people English? and where is the forest> I lived two thirds of my life in the UK and as far as I know, there are no dark, unprecedented forests in the midlands. The whole bally thing looks like a national trust conifer plantation. The angels look like anorexic pornstars (who were most of them, did my research). However, I got the bit when Judd was torn in pieces. <br /> <br /> PS I love Tom Savini and admire, but he can't act.
