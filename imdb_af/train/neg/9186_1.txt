You know the sense of hilarity you get when you look at a movie that is so hard to try to be a serious, thoughtful piece of cinema and fails? If you can't help but break out into the terribly dreadful trash of your screen junk? "House of the Dead" struggles to reach even this low rated cinema level. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end of the "House of the Dead" the feeling of being revived as you just woke up to find out that the cat had put this curly business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the outset that the female actors have been thrown for their clique size (which they unashamedly exploit) while the men for their hardcore kick-ass hold. I honestly didn't associate any of the characters for any moment in the movie and found myself wanting their death so I could save a good hour of this torture. Your Boll had to consider investigating two hours of recording the actual game as a movie. At least then we will perform better ?? However, not all debt can be put on the actors as it is definitely a challenge to deliver a convincing movie when confronted with the script of this movie. It's probably the worst part of the movie and actually contains such lines as: "It's zombies, pure and simple" and "No cap'n, we shouldn't go there! It's evil!". <br /> <br /> We all know that Zombie movies will never be particularly thoughtful or meaningful; In the best case they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and cache terror. Trash, yes, but entertain trash. Not the kind of garbage that comes out of your garbage, as you pull it over the room and smother your shoes in sour milk cartons and rot banana leaves. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead", such bad reviews received that no Danish cinema bought the movie. If we could just have had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final Score: 1/10.
