It can actually be the worst movie I've ever seen. Incoherent would be a compliment. Even the end didn't make sense, but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over. I watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to worsen and it did. By the end of this mess I was sorry that some of the characters had survived and I was not too charitable about the actors. If you want to see a train wreck, I suggest hanging out at a train station. Even waiting on an abandoned train platform hitting this mess. Apparently I did not venture enough to fill my prescribed ten lines, so I can say it again at the risk of redundancy. This movie is zero and it would be less if I had a word for a lower rating. How about minus zero?
