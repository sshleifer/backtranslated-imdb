This movie is AWESOME. I watched this now with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was good, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Bigger is so brave and clever. He made a movie totally different from those horrible Hollywood movies, like the Matrix and Stop or shoot my mom. However, it could have been better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like the big talon the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest man since that Domino Pizza Claymation guy. Not only does this movie look very cool, like those out-of-focus movies my dad made on my birthday when I turned 6. Outside this, a complex story with dozens of characters seems to be completely unrelated, but everyone meets in the end. It is genius how this web is woven to solve everything. I wish Ted V. Mikels will make a successor. But it needs more strangers. And a pirate.
