Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Shortly afterwards, he was approached by a dr. Price, an expert on electronic voting (EPP), claims it receives messages from Jonathan's trusted wife, Anna, via various electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is it just a hint of something on a larger cosmic or other worldly scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he's tied to is intricate and absurd on points; It is as if the movie does not know how to answer any of the questions it raises, so it only leads the viewer to new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton herself is pretty good, convincingly thrown as the infamous widower who urgently tries to communicate with his wife. He grew older like an actor, leaving behind the friendly waacky hijinks that he played 15 or so years ago. He looks a little cranky, perhaps with more wrinkles than he expects, but he has lost nothing of the fraud and panache he showed in his quarter-century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's not that Keaton is turning In a mediocre performance, it's the writing itself. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it progresses, every winding road ending in another boring path. It's all good and good if the road leads to some kind of acceptable elimination, something that more or less connects and explains ... something. But not white sound; I knew less about what happened to Jonathan than I did before I first saw him. Keaton is actually the only reason to look at this junk, though he has good support from Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as the required love interest.
