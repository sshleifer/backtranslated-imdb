This is an interesting treatment of a fairly controversial topic (just read the other comments on this movie). Apparently, you also love or hate it and it seems that most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end-time will occur as depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its sequels - are made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are right down there with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the acting is about the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my excuses to Ed Wood). To set aside the religious message, the story is as frightening as they come. Add even the slightest idea that the story is really close to something that can happen in the future and it even gets scarcer. <br /> <br /> This movie, and its successors, did not try for the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did. "Left behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to get into everything that "Thief" did and explained all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East. The net effect was "Thief" did a much better job on the frightening part of the movie, rather than spreading it too thinly to try to explain what happened in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie, and its prosecutions, for what they are - horror stories. That they may be horror stories indirectly said that God is just as frightening to them. If it reminds you of the subject, it did its job - even if you never believe it.
