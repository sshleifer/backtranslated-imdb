It's a pity when a movie like this is made. A lot of work and money was put into an amateur movie. <br /> <br /> Editing is dragging on, there are obvious mistakes that could be rectified in a second time and the soundtrack is unthinkable. So much more could have been done with this video. I think they have time, or video tape. <br /> <br /> Handshots have a clear amateur feel to them.
