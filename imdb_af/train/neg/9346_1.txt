This movie was a gift from titles to credits, it's boring to the point of tedium and the play is wood and stilted! It was the director, Richard Jobson, who launched his debut, but who on earth developed a script so badly than this one? Looks like another money in the drainage government project (Scottish Screen is being credited with surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and unfortunately my review will be more limited than this one. Please, Mister Jobson, what you've ever done before directing this drug of a movie, go back!
