Angels that got a bit were banned from heaven and now live in a British forest where they seduce and cheat teens. Talk about high concept. On the positive side, this little mom gives us Tom Savini, but since his play is limited to two minutes of screen time, his five-minute presence seems a bit long. The angels run for most of the film around the forest, but although they can have an angel's body, their faces look like a bad day like Joan Rivers. Moderate acting and amateurist gore effects do not help, and the nighttones kill Paris's most famous film on Tuesday. So bad that it's VERY bad.
