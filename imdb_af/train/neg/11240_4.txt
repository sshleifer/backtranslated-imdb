Unashamedly ambitious Kerry Conran sci-fi, for whom it is clearly a work of love. Unfortunately, it's just not that good. It all starts well enough - with an epic but persistent score, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock styling and the shining cinematography of a Spielberg. The film also refers to many pulp-sci-fi novels, series and films as diverse as The Day The Earth, Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy, which make me loved it. However, the film is not as good as any of these for various reasons. Most importantly, it is such a love of love, so worried that it will throw everything on the screen and create a brave new world. Conran actually forgets a movie. There is little or no tension, atmosphere or magic to offer here despite air balloons, dinosaurs and race-to-time sets. Even the noir elements fall flat. It is a broad way of looking at things - these elements fail mainly because nothing really feels and is so naturally fake - the green screen just looks like a video game half the time and it is clear that the actors are stuck afterwards. . The actors don't get much either - Jude Law is wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and that's all because of a horrible script - the kind that has to explain almost everything. It's a decent experience and some can get a nostalgic feel, but eventually it's a useless step in the world of yesterday. Nice ends already.
