I have never heard of this one before it turned up on Cable TV. It's very typical of the late 50's sci-fi: newer, depressed and not a bit paranoid! In spite of the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film in a documentary style is generally placed - this is perhaps a cheap way to leave much interpretation of narration and an excuse for as much human material as possible to enter. because it is undeniably a very low-budget venture! While not in itself uninteresting (the apocalypse via renegade missile angle which was later used with much larger aplomb for both DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and graciously short, the film's single-drive approach to his subject that leads to a great deal of unceasing laughter - especially in the scenes that have a threatening delivery and a gang of indifferent juvenile delinquents!
