I saw it recently and I have to say I was moved by the factual basis of the story. But, "Holly" as a movie didn't really work. However, I look forward to seeing the documentary made by the producers who organized this project because I think it will be a far more compelling work than this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast is made up of B-class actors, but their acting was appropriate, and I have to give a special mention to the young actress who played Holly. It was her first film role and she did a very good job, as hair is the most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was adequate, but blatantly like Patrick, the American whose aim is to save Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, his last role. Unfortunately, both of these actors, in spite of my most favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, have very much forgotten and did not do their best work in this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe in the movie's message and intent, but I have to be honest, so I rate "Holly" 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie. But I think the topic deserves serious consideration and I'm glad the people behind this movie have also made a documentary that I hope will have its debut on the BBC and other TV networks.
