Man, I was disappointed. Adam Arkin is whiter than Ross Geller of 'Friends'. <br /> <br /> 2) A good throw is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateurish script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie is suffering from terrible pacing. It jumps in a confused, confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story doesn't even make sense. Why does he want to break the soccer strip? What about the silly violin music? None of this is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a lot of accountants trying to improve, say, "Look at me! Look, I'm funny!" It was a bad attempt to make another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I love Larry Cohen movies, but the man he failed here. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Very disappointed.
