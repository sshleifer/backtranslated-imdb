102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Supposed to be healed, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and sets a new start in life. Cruella is doing well, helping out homeless dogs. When the clock stops at Big Ben, things get bad. The hypnotic healing was reversed and Cruella was back, and this time she was determined to make the spotted dress she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close repeats her role as Cruella de Vil and again is the highlight of the film. Every scene with her is worth watching in this dull follow-up, feeling more of a repetition of the previous film, rather than a new story. <br /> <br /> She's changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
