The box for "To Die For" swallowed me - a shirtless man and the promise of a few laughs and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is easy on the eyes, but not laughing and little sexiness. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, allegedly worked together for several years, but the character is not interesting. enough to care, so it's hard to think they care about each other. The mistake seems to be in writing, not the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they are given. <br /> <br /> The end is juicy and unpleasant (good, not quite unpleasant, I had relief that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about gay and funny AIDS, "Parting Glances" is much better.
