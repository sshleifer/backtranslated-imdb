This is surely one of the worst movies ever made and released by a great Hollywood studio. The plot is simply silly. The dialogue was written in clich√©s; you can complete so many sentences in the script. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron's. The "choreography" is stupid and totally unrotic. One can only be sorry for the reviewer who saw Yvonne's 23-year-old dance as sexual; it is simply very bad choreography. The ballet scene in the beginning of the film is particularly ridiculous. If you are in bad movies and enjoy laughing at some Hollywood's turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colored version on VHS, which made the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when she's brown, looks like a clown. And she's the best part of this movie. What a way to start a career.
