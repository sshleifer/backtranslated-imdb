Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy and thought it was unthinkable, fun. That's what it is, without the fun. This movie is really pointless, it is absent from any plot or character development, or any kind of story. The basic problem with this movie is death and gore. Actually, every death looks exactly the same. ZOmbies rip someone apart. Yes, it's good, but you also need some original death. I mean it really got lame, every death looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love Gore, and the Gore in this movie did nothing to me. It was just boring. No storyline, just the same lame scene over and over with another person. I also wanted to keep this movie. I love shot at video gore movies ... like Redneck Zombies. But I couldn't visit myself. This movie has good points but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped with the flood and there were more than 100 zombies, which is pretty cool about how they involved and helped many people around the world. But in general, it's a terrible movie.
