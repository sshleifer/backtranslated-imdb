Wow, that drops a total! The fact that people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of "The ring." The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion. Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The whole movie was a boring, stupid, mess. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in years. And that Buffy Chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented. No, wait, it would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I suppose many kiddies helped this movie at the cashier's office, as it was PG-13, and if it was rated R, it would have bombarded IMO! Stupid movie!
