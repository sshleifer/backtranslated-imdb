A note to everyone who is your budding movie writer: Study this movie. If you read dialog like the dialog in this movie, please delete your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I didn't have high expectations, but was intrigued by the description indicating that there was a riddle at the Christmas Ornament Factory. The Mystery is solved very early and the film becomes a straight romance. I almost stopped watching it after 5 minutes, 10 minutes and at the first break. My spouse, who is the Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, got up on the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a company town. The main business is Aikens Ornaments, which makes all kinds of holiday decorations. The company's patriarch recently died, so the companies' future might be compromised. We'll soon meet Noelle, who would rather be on Wall Street than Main Street, and she's crashing into the Justins car, the mysterious Justin, who gets a date with Noelle after a big snowman. Once we meet Alison Aikens, with the necessary caution for the Council, we have our story set up. <br /> <br /> If you can't nail all the story bows during the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough this kind of holiday movie. Maybe it's a good thing.
