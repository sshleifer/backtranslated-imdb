I don't know why, but for some bad reasons, since I was on the Disney successor, I decided to see only 102 Dalmations. The first movie that was a remake of Disney cartoon-classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil looked like it was a definite hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason these movies don't work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon. It only worked better and was more appealing to both children and adults. It wasn't really that nice, because it's adults who run to try to act like cartoons instead of just real people. I understand they are trying to make sure it is attractive to the kids, but it is ridiculous to see how these actors act. in the movie. And 102 Dalmations' story isn't really that good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is proven to be animal and a pleasant person. But her reputation has now been damaged as a puppy traitor, but she buys a man's shelter and is suddenly loved by everyone and she seems to have changed. But when she sees her attorney's Dalmatians, she gets mad and starts to see her spots, and she loses it. She is on revenge on puppies and is still determined to get the Dalmation dress she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is such a wonderful actress, very much among the judge, but she takes Cruella De Vil, she is good, but let's face it, this movie has the bad guy made more of a dull nutshell. Also as cute as the puppies, it just works for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not as credible without the cartoon and their personalities are in the mix. I wouldn't really recommend 102 Dalmations. It's good, but if you agree that the first movie just wastes time, it's just the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
