A missed train. A wrong phone number An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you if you make an apparently harmless decision? Most people do not give it a thought as they have absorbed in their own thoughts and deeds. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story of interrelationship and cause and effect of everyday life as it relates to a group of ordinary Paris people. There are all the components of what is over for the contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned. <br /> <br /> There is a fraudulent man, an illegal immigrant, a classic butcher, a suitcase, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as the former protagonist (in the sense that she is as much as a camera on camera and opens and closes the movie) and a normal girl who just can't find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> She learns from a stranger on a train that keeps her horoscope for her at the start of her day. What happens to her during the day is told by several characters. Is the forecast true? The concept is good, but the storytelling is faint. The connections from one event to the next are poor. There is a better storytelling in 15 seconds from the Liberty Mutual Insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and surrenders it to another than it happens in two hours. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you can definitely sacrifice the time for this movie, but you will make it dissatisfied and wonder what the same storyline can be if it is handled by a better producer and director .
