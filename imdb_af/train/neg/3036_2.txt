This movie was absolutely horrible! I can't understand how this movie made it into production. Nothing against the movie of the movie, it is of course the fault of the writing team. You take the old average plot - let's dance our way to be poor and needy - or STEP in this case. But this one is missing out on a true plot - or at least one that someone will care about. With Canadian speaking actors who have to be an American institution, this movie falls flat. On a positive note, directing was pretty good, and cinematography was also pretty decent. It seems the production budget was also very generous. My only request is that this team leave the script alone and find real scriptwriters to help them bring words alive to film. Net result - how she moves is how she sucks.
