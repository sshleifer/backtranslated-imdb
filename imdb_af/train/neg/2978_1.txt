I'm a big fan of horror flicks, and zombie movies are a particular favorite of mine. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. It is therefore unnecessary to say that I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've ever seen. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead", but while the film was deliberately funny, it is the opposite. It has some of the most ridiculous plays I've ever seen, especially of the main scientific character. His scenes with the general were only hysterical. Also the effects are subtle and in many cases messy, and the dead scenes are often just stupid. This, of course, makes it even better. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the man opens the fridge door and sees the cut zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somehow flies out of the FRIDGE (clearly pulled out with a little rope) and kills him . Zombie heads have the ability to float now? It defends every law of physics known to man, and it is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. It's just one of really really good times in the idiotic mess. I can't believe it got such a high score here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and hire this sucker.
