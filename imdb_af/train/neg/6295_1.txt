It is impossible to say that - despite the strange ridiculous panegyric to his so-called "abilities" placed here - the director of this indecent, ominous tosh has since not made a film. Well, that's great news for me. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies have all the creators of the creator, but do not have the white and technical skills that Martin Amis makes the writer readable. <Br /> <br /> When will the UK film industry wake up and realize that if it has to stop the status it once had, stop making garbage and make something real people want to see? <br /> <br /> Avoid like the pest.
