THE IMMORTALIZER was interesting. It certainly didn't kill me during his hour and a half, but it didn't impress me much. A group of children are kidnapped in a lane by muscular head mutants (in a scene with the least convincing finish of the cinema) and taken to a fine home in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team of brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, it's been released a few years later with a big budget! Who knew this if you transplanted an old man's brain into another body, that their new voice sounded exactly like their old voice? With all these tales of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of OUT AND INSIDE ANIMATOR dancing in the producer's heads. But the production literally doesn't bother to pull it off. I have never understood why, when someone makes a low budget horror movie, they do not pack it on the edge of the frame with gore. The play is uniformly horrible, with the only good performance by Clarke Lindsley as assistant dr. Price came. He has a nice evil laugh. The only other thing about IMMORTALIZER is that it owns many old people who do their own stunts. Seriously, most of the throws take some serious bumps for old people.
