The novelty of the healthy Jay Leno spray-square words is the only memorable aspect of this formal mismatch police partner. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican-confronted comedian teams with the late Pat Morita to find a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot?). The two lead hard, they really do, but Leno is not an actor and Morita's fish-out-of-water routine hurries quickly. The film carries a little cheesy '80s appeal, but its worthy moments are becoming increasingly scarce, as it completes its 100-year running time. Fans of Leno's significant comic talents will make you feel; Everyone will just be bored.
