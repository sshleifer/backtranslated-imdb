By the time this movie was released, I saw Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and the biggest rumors were the long rumored production of a movie of the story. My wife and I were in line for hours before the box opened on the day the movie was released. It wasn't just a disappointment, it was a kick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First of all, the story is "out-of-the-box," so to speak, by plays not in the theater boundaries. Those who are limited are much of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and Third Together (Give Your Own Order): One of the original songs, with a very dynamic dance number, has been removed; A song NOT in stage production was added. What do you say ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the artists. I've seen Chorus Line on stage six times, and I won't see it anymore six times before I die. It is wonderfully written, with wonderful music, and heartbreaking real stories. If you want to see a music game that includes a large cattle call audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of a Chorus Line, see it on stage.
