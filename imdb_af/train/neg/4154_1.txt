Vampire Vs. Zombies were not the original title. It was actually ... Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Get Hit by Cars: Special Guest Appearances by Bob the Lesbian Gypsies Witch and her Dog, Random Woman with Special Forces and Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: No plot - only the author and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I like bad movies. I love Vampires. I love Zombies. Hell, I even enjoy the lesbians. This movie has combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, terrible (I mean VERY BAD) dialogue, and random STUFF and PEOPLE who have nothing to do with anything (or do they ... I did not know what was going on in the world). Oh, and I can't forget the green oatmeal 'Zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their zombies in oatmeal and paint). Anyway, the result was this exuberant BAD movie, if you could even call it. <br /> <br /> Was the end supposed not to make sense? The Vampire was really a nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the Vampires not at all ... you couldn't really call one of the girls' vampires. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Don't ever rent or buy this movie. If you are VERY curious ... well, I will understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies will not be able to stand this one. This should be number 1 on the bottom 100.
