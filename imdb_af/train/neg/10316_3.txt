To be honest when I first heard of this show, it might be a bad idea to make a show that Muslims make on themselves, but that is the exact opposite. I realized that the show could help people understand that if a Muslim uses such a word like this in real life, it doesn't mean it's a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype. By watching the show, regular people will realize that although there may be bad Muslims, it does not mean that we are all bad, we just try to live. day at a time, like how difficult it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like "Blow up" or Yaser, we said we would blow the competition away and people went wrong. Being a Muslim, I know that things like this don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq. It's not the right thing. people will see how we are treated poorly by watching this show and it can remind them how the act. I'm glad a show like this came up on the air. There are many ways that Piotr Muslim people are terrorists, many find them funny to me. It's good to do it now and then because Prety has made a lot of fun of who we are to say you can't do fun unfairly, but it is done regularly and gives Muslin people a bad name.
