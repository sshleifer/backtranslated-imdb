Coyote Ugly could have been very effective if the filmmakers made it an R-rated guilty enjoyment / exploitation movie (with lots of nudity.) But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios want today, we end up with A movie like this: a PG-13 "tease" flick that shouldn't go as far as the movie. <br /> <br /> The font is generic that it is easy to guess which plot point will last 15 minutes before actually happening. The acting is enough, but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing can be done with them. There were also lots of points where I looked at a music video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The only asset of the movie is the incredibly beautiful female lead. We see them in some extremely tight and revealing outfits ..... but just as much can be shown due to the PG-13 restrictions. There are many whistling and tinted bodies that do good choreographic dance numbers, but there is no nudity or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (she is becoming increasingly bad with age) is also a very small amount of time in the movie. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows a real acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see were "can't watch R-rated movies yet. The audience can get a lot of it from a titillation aspect, but adult audiences will be irritated and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: the movie-1 women-10
