'Triumph of Love' is proof that not all Comedy-French writers using a darkened courtroom like Shakespeare are worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps something has been lost in translating this adaptation of Marivaux, a Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright, of whom Brittannica says: "His nuanced feelings and clever wordplay have become known as mariaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino had three pleasures of mixed romance, her trouser roll wasn't even in Cherubino in "Figaro's Marriage." <br /> <br /> The repetitive editing is annoying and seems to indicate that many tasks were needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw as the dressed spinster as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The glimpses of the audience we see and the closing of the snare to see that it is all, do not really help. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/29/2002)
