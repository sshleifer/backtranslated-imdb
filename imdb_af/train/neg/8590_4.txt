Ridiculous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into shiny 19-year-old Annakin, somehow attractive to Amidala, 5 years old senior. The 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero, Annakin, has some bad dreams, and it also requires beating children, his friends and the whole framework of his life because a crazy old man convinced him: a ) His precious wife may really die, and b) Only he can prevent it. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think the people holding this movie don't pay attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally the twisted sense of "fantastic", "wonderful" etc). <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and friendly anchor for the whole series, but in the climax he hooked Annakin's legs, let him burn in the lava and let him suffer. Not someone thinks it's a bit out of character? Not to mention it was quite stupid to take a chance on him, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> At least I expected a story that shows consistent characters with credible motivation. Not one of them. The story could be written by a 10-year-old. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the CGI is pretty cool.
