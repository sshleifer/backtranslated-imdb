It is a poor movie with a turbulent history of cuts and reappointment. It doesn't work at all. First, the dramaturgy is all wrong. It moves very slowly and ends quickly and unsatisfactorily. But there is (and can do with the cuts) an awkward shift between genres. It starts with an excitement taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. The end may be funny, but it is so blunt that I almost felt my intelligence (which is little there). So the movie tries to be everything but doesn't really succeed at any level. You can also see this in the very unstable character development. You almost get the impression. Connery plays three roles rather than one.
