I'm not sure it was the language or the poor, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, it's a big disappointment. There is no connection between different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor. I couldn't even believe that people can make such a mess of something that has great potential. <br /> <br /> And most of all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler's self sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie looks like a collection of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
