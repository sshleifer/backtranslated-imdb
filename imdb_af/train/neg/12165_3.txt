So Angela grew up and received therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter, rather than the son she was born, and now has a job as a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. Anyway, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequence - more blood, more imaginative murders (which are not imaginative, but more so than the original), more nudity, a more elaborate plot and generally worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It is entertained in the same way as the original, because the characters and cupboards are so good and so authentic 80's that you can't help getting a good laugh. At one point, a man asked Angela, and she said, "I'll call you," and then quickly away. The guy says to himself, "How's she gonna call me? I don't have a phone!" and then he sobbed his armpits and wondered what turned her off (that's the hair, dude !!). It is a well-known fact that murdered teens in the 80's were more frequent films than were not punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior, usually because it was too prominent. When I first made the 13th movies in the mid 90's for the first time, I didn't realize it. I learned it a year or two later in a movie class and was surprised that they were a method for the madness. I was very impressed, not only that the movies somehow overtook the message, although it was a morbid, but there were actually a few thoughts. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At one point just before Angela killed one of her victims, she said, "Let it be you a lesson. Say no to drugs!" Actually subtle screen, guys. Then again, the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie. Angela (who has gone through all the therapy and operations and everything that is difficult to clean her past and rediscover herself as a normal and well-developed person and changes her name from Angela to Umm, Angela). say at one point, "I don't like being the wicked witch of the west, but I know what happens when things get out of control." (People are being killed ... by me!)! <br /> <br /> Then she later claimed that one of the counselors, Mare, apologized, then the girl replied, "I'd rather die! "Sorry, Mare, but you really got into that one ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago, I was a camp counselor at a sleep camp, similar to the one depicted in this movie ( Apart from the camp I learned from, more than three children had 15 or 20 counselors, and it also had rules that didn't have one in the movie. the movie is, of what kind of camp it really is. <br /> <br /> It's good, but you can hardly make a movie like this with many 9-year-olds running around, although there are about 10 or 11 year olds in This movie was murdered, I've never seen that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for a cheesy 80-year-old movie.
