The movie's trailer has interested me enough to rent the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely scary! This is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it has been astonished! <br /> <br /> The main problem is the movie that doesn't know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting as it deals with the pitfalls of mail order brides, but the movie is a mess. What starts out as a slightly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the least possible terms) then goes completely in reverse and degenerates into a very dark and unpleasant misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman needs to know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Just as Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only accept, did it for the money. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie in pretty much every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexistical that you can almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just really nasty. A movie to be avoided unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their movies!
