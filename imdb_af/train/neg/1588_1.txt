It was the worst movie I've ever seen in Billy Zane. I understand that this movie was mainly the new comers, which did well for newcomers, but over all, the movie was not credible. <br /> <br /> With all the gunfire, you'd think the police would have intervened. Even the coin that was a mistake on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realized the currency was the mistake, wasn't realistic. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie is snapping fast. Poor work. Get a better author. <br /> <br /> The score to the end was not in line with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy Sean is going to blast, he'll be bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's character was goofy. It was so stupid when Sean hit him. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
