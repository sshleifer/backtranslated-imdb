I'm still deciding if it's the worst movie I've ever seen. A very disturbing problem with this movie is that real scientists are interviewing, but their footage is being edited to make it look like the ideas of many BSers populating this movie. The relationship between the BS and the signal of the interviews is about ten thousand to one. In the end, it appears that the interrogators say, "We want you to think!", But they are too lazy to do simple research on what they claim to be a fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you are open-minded and want to expand your consciousness, please openly read real-life books on quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe", Nigel Calder (a scant volume, not a challenge not), "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz Pagels. If you can't bring yourself to read a book, please do not complain to the reviewers that they are "open-minded". <br /> <br /> To recover, this movie is just incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> You know what's a very good movie that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Slim, sexy, alluring.
