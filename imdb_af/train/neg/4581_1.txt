Pathetic effort to use science to justify new life service / philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the subatomic world, you can never predict a particle location at a specific time. You can only give the chance that it will be exactly in one place at a time. The observation of observation also seems to affect the event. Solid particles can move through obstacles. All this, so far, is accurate. But then they claim it means that if you really believed you could walk through a wall, you could do it. This is a complete poppycock. Instead, the theory claims that it is possible on your level to walk through a wall, but it is only by chance and has nothing to do with faith. You also have to keep walking in the wall forever to have the least chance of going through the wall. The chance is so astronomical about it. <br /> <br /> This is but one example of how they misrepresent science. But much more annoying is the story of an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused that it is incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truth, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Plus, string theory is now the hot new thing in physics. Instead of wasting your time with this liquor, I suggest you rent the Elegant Universe, a wonderful series made for NOVA on PBS. It gives you a history of Newton's physics and gravity at Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours of episodes. Quantum mechanics is fairly well explained here if you want to know it without the metaphysical mapping.
