The volleyball genre is barely overlooked by most authors. Fortunately, highly-acclaimed director Nelson McCormick brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (lower than Side Out and above, well, umm). However, do not drop the cover of this movie. Kill Shot stars and come starring Koji as a contemporary Sherlock Holmes. Using such high-tech gadgets as a computer less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji FBI agents can help in finding a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other role-players in the film, including short comics by Denise Richards, a gay negro and a keen ugly and annoying girl, Koji wears this movie on her own. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.
