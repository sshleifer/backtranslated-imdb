This movie, The Alamo: Thirteen days to glory, is total rubbish. The acting is terrible, it is too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (Historians will have a field day). It does have a few good moments, but not enough to keep an eye on it, because it's too long. Rating * from **********.
