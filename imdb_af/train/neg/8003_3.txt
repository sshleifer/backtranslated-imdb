Don't be fooled because I was quoted by the 'glowing' reviews on the DVD box. "Wildly entertaining.", "A very freaking freakout." And worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS." This movie is not one of the above. <br /> <br /> I usually don't bother writing bad reviews for movies, but I can't believe this one rests on a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> After a daylight daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, lazy scientist-dumped chemicals, this movie is going nowhere and it's going to be sloooowly. Actually and unlikely, a girl is hanged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design, but it's not a WETA creation) and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half about to follow her ... in the sewers around the Han River. Their search has no more tension, someone called it in the same way as Jaws? And by the time they find her, you realize it's pretty sensible. Other than that, a big part of the movie is dedicated to a government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene in which a man spits in a gutter before a busy bus stop. <br /> <br /> Bad. It was bad. I'm not joking. You want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you will save 30 minutes of your life.
