If half of this movie's footage looks powerful, it means you look too much at this gory Italian cult cat! For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this movie, but he also had the boldness to use the most sadistic killings in his own (and more easily traceable) Cat in the Brain. The start scene, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated, appears in Fulci's later movie and also a handful of murder and sloppy moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails miserably as a giallo, as the search for the sadistic killer among a filmmaker shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and exciting, but it is still good entertainment when in cheap shocking horror waste. . The incoherent script introduces a whole lot of indifferent characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings that Biachi pops up is probably and you can point out the killer almost immediately. What remains to be enjoyed is the really bad makeup effects and the hilarious horror of the ensemble cast. When there is no bloodshed on the screen, between the first and second killings, "Massacre" is a slow and almost unbearable dialogue with unnecessary photography. Fortunately, in the second half, there are women who are placed on fences and men are repeatedly stabbed with rosy nails. The music is shit and the use of filming places is very unattractive. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the aforementioned "Cat in the brain". That one has ALL the great moments of "carnage", and then some.
