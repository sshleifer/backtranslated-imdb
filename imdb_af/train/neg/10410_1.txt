It is a confused and incoherent mess of relentless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. It's not exaggerated: you have to make a tremendous effort to get involved. <br /> <br /> I thought Fassbinder would make something interesting to tell why Erwin / Elvira does suicide, but at this stage someone is trying to explain: "When he was young, it happened ..." and "he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there ..." </ br /> <br /> Soon in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in a butchery talking to a friend prostitute (definitely a butchery is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while she tells her of the story of Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows the death of one cow to another. It's hard to choose between paying attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course we come to the very forced and gross symbolism of "I suffered a lot in my life and will die." <br /> <br /> In one of the few moments where something actually happens, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover, only after he has done a very gay choreography with two other guys level of homosexuality), he admits Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I have to admit (as the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything in the movie is wasted because of Fassbinder's self-ability.
