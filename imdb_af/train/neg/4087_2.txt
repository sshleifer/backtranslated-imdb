I usually talk about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie there really isn't much to talk about. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better sword and sorcery epics. Lack of coherence runs continuously like banality. Even the main flawlessness that refuses to wear other clothes is a loincloth, which is rather dull. She has a breast of a young boy. It's almost amusing in its incompetence at its best and seriously delayed. Lucio Fulci scraped the bottom of the bar and showed it. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Posters & Stills Galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US & International Theatrical trailers. Eyebrows: Sabrina Siani is topless throughout (some may consider it attractive, I did not); various extras are also topless
