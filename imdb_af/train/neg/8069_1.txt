An incredible mess with a mysterious soundtrack, "Soul Survivors", is the latest entry in the "whose death is and what lives" genre of horror movies. Two teenage-like couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before joining Thanksgiving Break, they attend a final fling at a rave-type party in a burnt out church on suggestions from nice Slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, also known as Faith, the other vampire). Motifless, messy guys start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and long before the quartet leaves the festival. To drive away in their SUVs, they are pursued and then passed by the careless, eager guys who instantly and inexplicably in the middle of the highway do an unpleasant and fatal accident. The SUV flips over a bank and falls into a bank. river. Sean was killed (or is he?), And Cassie spent the rest of the movie with loneliness and guilty feelings (his driving) when she was not pursued by Sean's ghost or chased by the careless, rude guys. Many unexplained incoherence follows as Cassie's mental state degenerates further until we reach the predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who lives? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who really cares?
