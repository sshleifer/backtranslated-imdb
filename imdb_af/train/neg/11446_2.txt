My family and I checked out the night before the night. And as bad as Underdog (my four-year-old loved it), Hot Rod makes it as worthy of Oscar. The only thing that could have saved this movie was if Evel had come out of retirement to face Samberg to make this movie. However, I would admit that the soundtrack was good. I wasn't sure the movie was in the 80's, but with most of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would succeed. And stay home and watch the test pattern at your local TV station. Or if you are dead, it will look, then people can enjoy it.
