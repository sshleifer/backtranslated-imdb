"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; It's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possibly American movie audiences and critics being so damned and lobotomized by the outburst that Hollywood is looking to price the skies even a mediocre movie, with hardly any laughter? That's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and I rather use the terms because there is nothing funny in this movie) becomes good reviews. <br /> <br /> I put through this film that writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel will even think for a moment their writing was funny. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well to movie. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British movie with Colin Firth and Rut Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was starred for a movie in 2000, writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's humor and humor. They made one of the best films of that year. <br /> <br /> So why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so painfully wrong? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters that we liked, respected and understood. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel all cut out Hornby's work. By repeating the story, they slaughtered it and removed everything that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replaced it with conventional drives. <br /> <br /> They've transformed a funny story into a formal romantic comedy, never once out of the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girls, each with a clear feature. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" was a fun thing that was not just a good-looking man and woman, but also involved in supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch", the six supportive friends do nothing or say it particularly funny. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the movie is because the formula requires it. Poor Ione Skye wind like one Lindsey's pals in an ungrateful role. The beautiful Skye should have been Lloyd Dobler going in and taking her away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have made an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is too clever to join himself to such a completely boring script. <br /> <br /> There isn't a single one-off moment in this movie that looks original or casual. Every plot turn is predictable, every lame joke telegraph. Ganz and Mandel work for the laugh. The first 45 minutes are so slow, you wonder if these chaps realize they are writing a comedy. You can mark the plot turns in this movie through your watch. It was almost as if Ganz and Mandel wrote it with some writer-writer guru's wall-mounted formula. When they came to a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says it should happen now." And, presto! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't help the movie. They have no idea how to make their story and characters known (they don't give the V.O. story to the main character, but to another man sitting behind Ben at Fenway Park). Thanks to some special writing, we have to see how Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfulfilled initial meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore looks nice and rich better than most. She is as good as Goldie Hawn in her heights. But even her sweetness can't save this extraordinarily horrible movie. She tries hard to erase energy and humor from this story. About 30 minutes into the movie, Lindsey tells Ben, "You're funny." The only explanation for her comment is that it was in the font. Because Fallon's Ben never says anything funny. Fallon is not funny or funny; when he does comedy, he surpasses. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good at "Saturday Night Live." He might have been the least funniest person on that show. Remember that sketching over a radio DJ has done all the voices? The only reason why "Weekend Update" sometimes worked was because Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows something about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are funny and act so rarely, as ever, are actually funny. This is true of Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he barely sets up a rogue. His stuttering, uncertain of himself did not work on the small screen; It is duller on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fallon requires some dramatic moments in this photo. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a load of his dramatic stuff. Two special scenes - the first in a park, the second in front of Ben's school - are painful to watch. The screens require an actor with a forge of dramatic abilities, but Fallon does not have the knowledge or ability to make them work. His range of emotions doesn't even range from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. Often, he appears like an eagle. And not a sweet one about it. It touches the thoughts Lindsey would find attractive to him. Compare Fallon's performance to Firth's in the English version, and you'll understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forced Fallon's Ben is and how wrong he is for this role. Looking at Fallon in 'Fever Pitch', you want the dramatic depth and comic nuances of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Just like High Fidelity, a US Fever Pitch can work. It only needed better writers, more capable directors and certainly a stronger, funny, smarter, leading man. Make yourself a big favor: Avoid this rotten film; rent the 1997 British version and read Hornby's book instead.
