In the glory days of the 90's (God resting his soul), you can turn on the great comedy center anytime of the day and see the biggest sketch comedy show of Saturday Night Live. It was a glorious show, whether it was the original Non-Ready-for-Primetime players, or the second golden age of SNL, with the likes of Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade. And it all went to hell. . I was exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago and I think I should be shocked. How can such a terrible appearance be so long? There are so many terrible mistakes. I think I'll start writing. The writing is for the most part awful. This is nothing but kindergarten humor. The cast, for the most part, is talented. There are a few sketches I enjoyed, like some of me. Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents on the show like the beautiful Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not just as a comedian. Although there are a few sparse ha ha moments, it is not enough to satisfy this endless line of horrible fools, populated by babbling idiots. Miss this one
