I saw thousands of movies and have never written a review, but the Red Eye I saw is so inconsistent with the glowing tributes here. I'm obliged to offer two cents in protest. to bring the average closer to reality. <br /> <br /> It's a boring, boring stinker of a movie that only depicts the excuses of the terrorists (a John Bolton esquire bully diplomat who is actually a good guy, don't know) and of the oh-so-handsome and popular Dr. Phil (whose best-selling book, one learn, is read by regular kites worldwide). The only true Red Eye I experienced was rubbing my eyes in disbelief. <br /> <br /> Before deleting $ 10 or so dollars for this B movie, read the selected Quotes above and ask yourself if you really enjoy a movie in which it is the smartest that is found. Unfortunately, nothing else in this movie is better. The basic premise is goofy than hell; the acting is vague and uninspired, completely lacking in pro / antagonist chemistry; The potential for tension is enforced by every turn - except for the last five minutes - through poor directing and anticipatory editing; the script is hit with irregularities such as: early revelations of the heroine as a university lacrosse star is questioned when she later argued the antagonist with a hockey stick; and the plot holes are wider than the first class (while character development is strict coach). <br /> <br /> And then there are the moments of utter ridiculousness, such as when the daughter of a high-level civil servant does not walk straight for airport security, on her first occasion, to warn them of a murder arrow against both the head of the country's security and her father. Or when the same woman runs for leather along lacquer fly linoleum, bend armrests and veins in her neck while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels. Or if her runner also chases with a sucking wound in his trachea. Or if terrorists use a fishing pole to bring their arms out of the freaking harbor. I'm always ready to suspend unbelief, but I'm not going to jump 30.00 feet without a parachute. <br /> <br /> The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it depicts women who are capable (even in bimbo form) of dealing with the most extreme emergencies - the kind of gender imaging American movies are missing out. Unlike this, this movie never really takes off and it is no longer exciting than the red eye flight from Boston to NY. Remember the last time you went through deceptive trailers and glowing tributes in the forum or elsewhere? It's one of those times. Wait for the Red Eye video, and look no further.
