When Ritchie first erupted on the film, his films were considered funny, spiritual, benevolent and original. If one could compare the hype that he had generated with his first two attempts and the fact that he had almost both outings, she created two outings that one had to consider. Did Ritchie find out? Is he really that talented? Does he have real original ideas? Or is he simply a predictive and selfish director who wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone, thrown into one colossal and disorganized hope? After watching the Revolver, you can apologize for thinking, has it all gone wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and intricate ideas? Revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and concise, trying to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, trying to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a great effort to achieve all these many goals and invests large pieces of a manuscript in existential musings and numerous plots. In the end, however, it's just a very uneven, unstructured and eventually unfriendly film to the audience. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie at least tries to give his own turn, he must be punished for delivering it even as his own work. So what the audience eventually gets is a terrible screenplay that has been converted with many pretentious onliners and clumsy objects. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Revolver is an inexhaustible and mere film that has stolen many themes of masterpieces such as Fight Club, Ordinary Suspect and Pulp. fiction. The goal is high, but inevitably shots are countless. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves lambasted, it's a really poor movie that is busy as a wannabe masterpiece masterpiece. However, it falls flat on its sharp face and fails only on everything it wants to be and reach.
