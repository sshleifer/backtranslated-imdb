I must admit when I saw this movie, I didn't really have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally and totally disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a hot shot that tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends. There is little mention of a girl stalking him, but it is almost for that character. What I don't really think, because it will probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> So, while convincing him on a subway Rainn Wilson (which I'm actually holding before this movie), he's talking to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. It's strange to say the least, since everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman doesn't belong to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from "hot". Usually I'm already for his acting, but even he can't save this movie. His character was jumpy, unrealistic and rather annoying. You can never tell if the authors are trying to make the comic spectator gay man, or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But anyway, someone steals her purse while leaving the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming rescuer he walks to the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero, or "G-Girl", as they would like to call her in the movie. It still darkens me about what the "G" stands for, but we'll debate it for the message boards. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I accept are supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who has sex so? They throw the bed through the wall, because Uma Thurman's "passion" tells us. It hurts my head, but not in the "I think very hard to understand this way. <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris and calls her a" whore, "I have no debate Apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly, she can't act like that and trust she is blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have walked out of the theater as "I didn't pay $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you're moving your head doesn't mean you're acting. <br /> <br /> Also, writing and storytelling could work a lot or use a game and a little lighter fluid, I actually started to be ashamed of the actors and their dying careers. Overall, if you value your money, and your self-respect does NOT waste your time with this pathetic effort in a movie.
