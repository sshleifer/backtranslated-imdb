I'm so glad and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the films produced by A-pix entertainment, and without exception everything that this company handles is pure crap! First of all, and this is very important, never look at this movie any more! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one I feel is deliberately bad. I just can't figure out how fake the snowman is. That's why she's always only briefly shown. The way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece crap, becuz made to be a good movie, and the version is as bad as this.
