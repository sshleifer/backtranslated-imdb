OMG this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. I'm a film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money so badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything she ever was in, so I looked at this 2 another one. It was SOO bad! Not even good, just bad. It had 1 or 2 funny moments, but it was bad, a waste of 101 minutes. I can't say AJ looks good in it, because she didn't. The plot is predictable unless you expect a repeat of Romeo and Juliet, then it is not. Disappointing all around. Maybe if your 12 could be a good movie, otherwise I don't really recommend it.
