It was a strange movie. It started well. A solid soundtrack behind the flash images of gore and mayhem, as our psychopath did his thing. <br /> <br /> Then comes his "downfall" here. I could tell I was in for a real cheesy B-movie. Poor acting, I mean how difficult it is to hold a gun and act like a policeman? These guys couldn't. After our psychopath death scene we get the opening credit and the movie starts ... <br /> <br /> From this point it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and poorly-formed deaths. <br /> <br /> It said I gave the movie a four, because in spite of its mistakes it kept some kind of creepiness that I just couldn't shake off. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it to movie but I have to admit I look worse.
