What can I say, it's a brilliant movie-making movie that had to win an Oscar. A copy should be kept safely in a safe safe for progeny. It must be required for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most genius writer / director / producer / chef / babysitter / walmart greeter ever to spoil the cinema world with his art. Where do I start with this one? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so breathtaking! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he's so attractive. I'm surprised he's not for Mr. Universes have gone. I couldn't contain myself during the nude scene. I borrowed this movie from my brother and he phoned me on the phone and told how Arthur's nude scene was gay. Of course I am totally supportive of this film and it is beautifully crafted tolerance lessons. Why did I just burn a church yesterday and I wrote to Sam and Arthur in his smoldering as well. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was the best of this movie. When that Fed-Ex airplane went up in the midst of Vermont's palm trees, I wept! Why didn't I ever know they had palm trees in Vermont, or that people could travel for Fed-Ex planes before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new possibility. This film inspired me to write in Sam Mraovich's Writing Magazine School, Acting, Director, Composition, Casting, Producing, Production Design and Real Estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creation to life. We can never pay you again."
