I agree with the reviews I have read here, and I have no words to define such a turkey so, but in spite of everything I can still find a reason for movies to exist. Do you recognize those happy days in which video was a prosperous business, and many movies were made with the only reason to fill the shelves of video stores? This movie comes from that time and I can imagine that it was the only reason it was produced, and it also happened to many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember "Rambo" imitations? and so many slashers of Z grade, I still feel nostalgia for that period. About this movie I can say I did not watch my time, because I pressed the quick button after the first fifteen minutes, just for a very funny scene in which a man pushes an ax against exploding heads, because like you They see it well made of plastic. And in the end, well, it was so badly filmed that I couldn't understand what had happened. It's the same, I didn't follow the non-existent plot at all. But boy, video age was a good age despite movies like this.
