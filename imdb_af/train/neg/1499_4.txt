Tourists travel to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids. What they encountered is a terrible story of cannibalistic killers. <br /> <br /> If I were to sum up bad race, it would be a low grade gore festival. The movie mixes Dead Dead, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. It's just so bad that the movie has so much inconsistency to watch it lose any "fun" one would want to watch. The movie has very random horror nudity. Although the movie also dies four pornstars, yes four, so much more could have been. Breed also shows a good amount of gore. <br /> <br /> Angry Race has a terrible start, with ridiculous dialogue and horrible acting. It's a given in a straight video horror movie, but it takes the cake. I can't really figure out who the main character is, since the one "living" end is not so much in the movie. Speaking of the end, it must be one of the most random and false end in the history of the movie. It has no purpose with the rest of the movie and completely changes your view of the movie. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie to believe it, as there are some nice screens. There are two dead screens coming in my mind, one in which the innate killer rips the intestines from a naked woman through her chest .... yes her chest, don't ask me. The other id when the man gets his bowels, pulled out again by his asshole. Does it kill the man? No, the killer continues to strangle the man with his own intestines. These scenes remind me so much of Dead-Alive, with the right amount of humor in each one. I also have the feel of Evil Dead, with the inexorable name of horror movies and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet shouting for her life, while the killer desperately tries to get you in. <br /> <br /> Although the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor sound and visual not the quality of the movie. When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her footsteps are so hard and hard that she seems to wear shoes. Indeed, distracting. As well as the continuity in the film, with just one collaborated killer? As well as what character dies at any moment. I couldn't tell if the chickpea chick Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin was ... I can't remember. As well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body, still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> The terrible editing is also distracting, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting. It had a bad start and got better, but the end just brought the movie back to a horrible level. If there were better production values ​​and more faith in this movie, it would not be killed. Stay away from this movie unless you're happy with the underlying budget, terribly bad movie with decent gore.
