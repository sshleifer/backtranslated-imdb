Salvage is the worst so-called horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing wrong with that. It does not earn as well in a genre. First of all, I don't see how many people this piece of crap can think of such a good movie. If I wrote something so boring and completely ridiculous, I would have laughed at it and be too embarrassed to subject others to its stupidity. Secondly, the acting is terrible and the main actress is ominously ugly. Third: The story sucks, it has been used before, and the excuse that it is a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summer on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you waste 80 minutes wasting something that will make you indignant at watching it. I feel very bad for the Crooks and the irony of their name. All hael Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
