Sorry, my fellow citizens of Nevada City, but this one is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian had had too much botox because he had very few facial expressions throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Alice looked like she had a plate at her back. She was stiff in the movie. <br /> <br /> I both looked at Brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work. I would guess they were first-year students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason frankly wore the movie with every line. Ed certainly did not lose his charisma. I wish I had the time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love the snow scenes and scenes of shops and the church because I was there. I make Nevada City my home and wait anxiously at the premiere. I was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
