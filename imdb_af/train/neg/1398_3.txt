I bought it (it was only $ 3, okay?) Under the title "Gray Matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role irritated me. As the other reviewers warned, it is a bit boring story of a top secret government experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are many shots, especially from a house with a swimming pool for it. Some characters and interiors are so indescribable. I think the filmmakers are worried that we may forget who is who, so they keep us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. It's actually a little funny. After a while, the pool shot feels like a TV channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two bouts of name calling. At one point, an evil test subject captures someone in control by her "Scientific b * tch!" To name a few. It's just a very insufficient insult. Several scenes later let another topic steam by mumbling over that "scientific bartard!". It just seemed very uncomfortable to me. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will disappear forever. Another decade from now on, it will probably be impossible to find any copies of it. Almost like it never happened. <br /> <br />
