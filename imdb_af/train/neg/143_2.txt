In an effort to bring back the teen-slasher genre taken away by spoofs such as Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday, Valentine doesn't fall. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, it went new and farther than ever. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a dumb slasher-flick, which is almost never so good. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it's not funny. And the moment the killer comes on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD. Come on over! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
