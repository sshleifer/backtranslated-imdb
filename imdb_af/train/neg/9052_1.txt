I respect the fact that it is a very popular show. Compared to Robert Altman's inventive, hilarious, zany and pioneering 1970s movie classic, this performance was probably less than mediocre ... even though it lasted 11 years, it doesn't necessarily make any good. This show formed an all-integral part of my early childhood (it was running every night, guessing whose parents watched and laughed), but that's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I've really seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. On its own it is not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they are similar in name. For example, when has Alan Alda been anything like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is completely different, just like his characterization and prospects. The new characters are not that big; they only serve to let you miss the one they replace. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing actually conveyed to the series is Radar, which is still (though played by the same actor) merely a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yes. With a lag track (whether used in surgical scenes or not), it comes across as scary, due to what's going on in other institutions. And since it lasted almost four times the actual Korean War, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal gorge that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons. I have never liked this performance, and I will never.
