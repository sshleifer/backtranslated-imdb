It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really can't remember when I saw a worse one. I thought it was about an aircraft crash investigation. What it really was was a soap opera and a bad one. They overpowered the 'conflict card'. The first hour or so looks like a screaming match, with some unquestionable scenes being thrown in. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40 or so minute memorial scene (with the necessary black umbrellas and rain) to fictitious victims of victims was lame, and I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs unless you escape in 'conflict'. <br /> <br />
