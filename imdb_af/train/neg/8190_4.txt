My Tasks: A Tired Formula Christmas Comedy. The laugh is tired and the talents behind it also seem to be. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as the next man (even though I often have a bad holiday with the holiday blues), but it looks like a lot of holiday comedies. that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but it doesn't make them any less painful during the season. As if we have had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * gulp * still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (apart from the alternate raw humor and Santa's "Little" short helper helper), FRED CLAUS is a one-minute joke that lasts 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a role that could make a pleasant Christian time comedy that will probably melt with the snow, but it would have been so much better than that. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he is actually the long lost brother of the eternally outdated sister (Paul Giamatti) who invites his good uncle brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas, and she is close to being close. Hah! And guess who's playing Santa's mom! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! SI does not know if I want to praise the casting or to bash it. Here are some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they are far too little to work with. <br /> <br /> As far as humor is concerned, the best thing FRED CLAUS can possibly do is Santa's brother. being his exact opposite and joking about a DJ eleven. I have to admit I had a few giggles that Fred was involved in a group counseling for famous brothers (where he joined Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles started and ended there. Even worse, the movie even falls into sentimentality that is supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about "what Christmas really means". Apparently, what Christmas means to Hollywood is getting as much of our remaining Christmas shopping money as they can. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
