Camp Blood III is a great improvement on Camp Blood II, as it sounds mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot. This time they ventured a little further from the parking lot. The other two movies were filmed. This is a good move because you can no longer drive cars that are over to be a remote desert. <br /> <br /> This time there is a TV show and a fake clown to scare the participants. It is hardly a new idea, I have seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the true killer appears, but at least this one has a plot instead of people randomly stabbed. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this one is at least good for a few laughs. I liked how there is a shooting sound effect when someone gets up early and how the boom falls behind people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I don't know why anyone wants to make a third Camp Blood. movie, I thought it would be better to start from scratch, but at least they tried with this one. The half-name distorted woman was a little bit to me, they seem to be trying to maintain continuity by hiring a little freak that would get her clothes for $ 5 just as they did in the second movie. They haven't figured out that a cup is being used to cut, but it's a Camp Blood movie you expect? If you like crap movies, you'll get some fun.
