I don't think I'm too far from the base to say it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I worked on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day", "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Kwai," (all black and white) all of which are good sites, rich characters and great plays. I saw better dialogue and acted in student school high school one play play. However, the plot is not a bad point of departure - only poorly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident, though I couldn't turn it off! A movie doesn't have to be big money or a big set, ie "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" good ... so budget is no excuse. What do they think?
