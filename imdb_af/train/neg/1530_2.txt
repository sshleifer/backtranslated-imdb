I wanted me to have MAN in WHITE so I could see it again. <br /> <br /> "What do you mean, Theo?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean, I could see it again to see if it is so slow, stupid and so embarrassingly unfriendly as I can remember. <br /> <br /> Many people claim it was made for children. May I suggest that it be made by children too? because the whole structure of the writing has no form of discipline on the part of producers and writers, and many of the pieces seem to have been included, as it seemed to be a good idea. <br /> <br /> The cast didn't help but I really felt sorry for them. Honestly, you could believe that the film had to lie to their family during filming that they had filmed a hard core film, so they were embarrassed to be in something so gloomy. To give you an idea of ​​how badly the acting disappears every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappears from the narrative, I patiently waited for her to appear again later, later I forgot she was in the movie. Have this? A star of BAYWATCH appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie. It tells you everything you need to know about the standard of MEN in WHITE. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it's a lively action cartoon similar to the goods (Although the DISMALS would be a better adjectives for this movie), although the movie is earned, it may be " a credit never to go down to toilet noise, but it's a kid's movie (it didn't stop, but it shouldn't be at 11:00.)
