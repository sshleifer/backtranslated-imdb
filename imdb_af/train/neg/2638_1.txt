There is good. There is bad. And then they are The Sentinel, a "thriller" that is among the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is a good one, but never has a movie with so much potential that has been completely slaughtered. Guided by ham-handed edginess by Clark Johnson, it seems that every actor in this movie works on autopilot. Even the big Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I have never seen another movie with so many shiny holes in my life. The turn is predictable from square one, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they inspire the audience's audience. Avoid it at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a movie without value loss.
