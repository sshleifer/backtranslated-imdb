Life did it again. Can we say silly? I couldn't wait to end it. That plot was pointless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story was played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. In a while, the lifetime comes with a good movie, not one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do, I would avoid this one at all costs. It was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I scraped my face against a brick for two hours and soaked it in peroxide. It would have been more entertaining.
