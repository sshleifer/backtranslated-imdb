I felt the movie was dry ... very disappointing, no plot. He waited for something to happen and nothing had dried like a bone. A waste of money. One of Robins Williams' worst movies. If you don't believe me waiting a few months it will be on DVD because it looks like it's a pattern for movies that don't do well. In the theaters it is over before the year. This is one that you will not want. see or say why I spent my money on it! Plus, because it was such a new movie, there were only 8 people watching it .... It was on a Friday night at 9:50. I also felt it needed more excitement or something to keep us awake. When they spoke characters in the movie, the voices were also very low, you couldn't hear what they were saying.
