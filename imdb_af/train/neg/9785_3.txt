This movie, for an after-school special, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in class. A man teaches a lot of young underdogs how to be good ball players. We never see these underdogs as the good player is practicing them. They are suddenly meditated in good players. There are also too many characters and no character development. Too much time spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. It could have had a "Bad News Bears" feel (the original), as there was a girl on a boy's team, but there was no feeling for this movie. It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your legs after you have watched it, it is not nice to bag, not fun to watch, and is just a kind of ... there. Plain. Boring. Something you go to school before your evening before the evening. As dull as the day is long and it's a long, long day to watch this movie.
