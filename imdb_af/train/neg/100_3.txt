OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I could see it sitting TWICE !!! story line was pretty awful and in the first part of the first short story I wondered what the hell I was watching, but at the same time it was so terrible that I loved it, cheaply all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. The only thing that dropped him was calling halfway through his foolish name. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was pretty perfect, but if you laugh cheaply and you see it pounding through it.
