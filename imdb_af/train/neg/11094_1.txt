This movie is another on my list of movies not to bother. Seen it as an adolescent 40 years ago, rose late to do so. It was very hard to find that it was about 95% romance, 4% everything else, 1% history than that. That's what I call an ace and convert film, one with an interesting title, the real movie is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good film treatment, this film is almost an insult to those who served. The real members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not in the law, and were not the products of abusive homes, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more top class background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not for the smart alecks, and it knows everything, an individual like the one depicted here would not last two days, if it were the stock or infantry. Discipline in the French army was often tough. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
