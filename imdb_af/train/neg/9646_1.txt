The lack of content in this movie surprised me the most. First I have all those people compare it to Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say it was the worst of Rock On! So-so story Horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you have to joke me. The music was okay Khanabadosh was the job of the movie the rest was bad! Vipul Shah hasn't learned yet from Singh is King's critical basic comedy. Now Asin .. where does she feel sorry for Asin's fan out there, but she sucks so much time in this movie that she has not looked carefully at overdose makeup! My final verdict is going to see Aladin with your family instead of wasting your time.
