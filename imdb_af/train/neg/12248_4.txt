The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sobbing man and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> In any other way, this movie is a very lame rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with some Godzilla (1998) thrown in. <br /> <br /> As usual for a 90-year-old horror movie, the two non-star women each take their clothes off at least once. The female does not lead, as she obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie surrounds the filming of a very dull extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut and navigate in shark-infested waters. In this film there is also a huge saltwater crocodile in the area. People are eaten. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I don't care for a bad horror movie, but I really hate a dull bad horror movie, which it definitely is.
