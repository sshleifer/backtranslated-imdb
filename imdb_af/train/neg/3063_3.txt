Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. For example, Bonny and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robberies and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people caught in the depression when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This film has absolutely no substance. The Viggo Mortensen character appears soon as a folk hero. Why? He drives fast along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where she has been killed. Nobody is bothered to understand why he is trying to flee. Even worse, when the realization that he is not a red neck terrorist, no one in the government wants to help him if they try to save their back ends. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio emcee that builds on the story in support of our hero. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely incredible.
