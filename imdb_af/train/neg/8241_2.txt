This movie has many problems related to it. This makes it like a low budget class project by someone in the film school. However, I have to give it credit on his campsite. Many times in the film I laughed myself hysterically. It was so bad at times that it was comical, which made it a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low grade treasure with a twist of psychological horror and a little champion ridicule, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite friends and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialogue is impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is just there.
