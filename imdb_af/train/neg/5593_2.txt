I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was my youth who let me down. Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, appearance, appeal and evil beneath. Or maybe it was just this movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you suggest Dracula with a clever English accent and the body language to go with it? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and has no tension? Then it's a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - don't see it! I just gave it a 2 because I managed to stay awake during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you like this movie, you have to take sleep and be alone in a dark room with lots of unparalleled space behind you. Maybe only in your parents' home or in a stranger's home. Because not even the characters in this movie were scared, and I think it makes the whole thing happen! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in the Dracula theater history, perhaps fascinated by how the Dracula story evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because it is not so attractive, it does not appeal to the suggestive mystery that makes the Vampire myth so fascinating. <br /> <br /> In addition, so much of those tough guys felt about it. The landscape looks like cheap theater. And I'm not saying that everything that was made in the 70s has not been rejected. Because I can keep both old and new.
