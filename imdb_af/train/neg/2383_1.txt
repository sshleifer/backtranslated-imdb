It is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. Cool title, excellent director (I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before) and hey - Uma Thurman in the movie. How can you go wrong? Well, this is a question I have been in my temples for hours when I watched this turkey. <br /> <br /> Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be unfair, it's a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. The critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one of those rare movies that doesn't contain a single quality of salvation. Zero from ****.
