For those of you who are desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, you get the chance, and then come back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The man who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch, so he is being transferred to another prison, where wrestling champs hang around to watch bread. Twitch plans to leave the prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. <br /> <br /> Something happens and someone is shot, and the movie is in another prison in Die Hard. But the wrestler's daughter is trapped in it, so he and his grief will find her and Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the play is under play, it contains a lot of (really annoying) rap music, and poorly edited battle scenes. On the positive side, it has the Spanish lightning in it, which stars in every prison / action / thriller ever made, and he makes a door in it. <br /> <br /> It's not much event, but at least it's harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a massive fan of the original, it's okay. <br /> <br /> If not, you're warned.
