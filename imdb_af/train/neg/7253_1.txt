We rented the DVD and hoped for a good western. The movie was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why did the bad man actually kill the mine owner? Not really linked to the movie, except to determine how bad he was and to have a hideout. <br /> <br /> The bank employee went bad, just too weak to decide convincingly to hire murderers from his employers. At least we guess. No character developed for the bank owners or the bank employee. <br /> <br /> Lots of delay in much of anything happening. <br /> <br /> Absurd premium that Martin still had to see the judge after the gang admitted he was killing the in-laws. Even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff's husband. even more ridiculous that Martin was hanging and breaking his rope, the sheriff took him on the firearm to eventually return to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee. Will he not only come back after the gang sends the woman to rescue wife and arrest the bad banker? Does the adjudicator send a note confessing to the gang before being killed on the trail? Overall, very sad acting and no point to film.
