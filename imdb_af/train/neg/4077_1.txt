What do you get when you do bad acting, bad directing, careless scenes, terrible lighting, painful editing and horrible effects? You get Jessica: A ghost story Find his shot at Betacam, which is good, but the lighting should compliment this medium. In this case it is not. There are a few CU's where the person's face is completely shaded. In particular, the one scene is at the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the screens were so long that they could easily be cut in half. But I think they wouldn't have a movie. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD man, so he must have some "hero" elements, but he doesn't. He shines and scares the whole movie. I can go on, but I don't want to waste my time. Although the lighting was awful, I have to say they had nice camera movement. The lighting didn't compliment it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and that's where it ends. Not terrible.
