It is an amateur movie shot on video, not an "electrifying drama", as the DVD liner falsely boasts notes. I saw much better things about undergraduate film students. Most of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could be made with a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was pushed together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final editing is probably done with two cameras and the content is back and forth, rather than with a proper editor. Maybe they also did the editing in the taxi? The English captions are written by someone who doesn't flow English, for example, "Where are you going now?" To say the production quality is on par with Blair Witch is generous. If you are not scared yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with very cool and funky images from anywhere in Jakarta.
