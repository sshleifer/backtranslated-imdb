What a powerful start to a movie when Julia Roberts's character is played by her abusive and anal man, was played by Patrick Bergin and I was ready to experience a powerful movie on the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was wrong. This movie was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you really felt and had her pain and need to survive. Sleep with the enemy drives off to the first act of cheap excitement with Roberts escaping her death to escape her husband and living in Iowa. Her husband initially believed she was dead, but began to grow suspiciously, that she could still be alive and sat down. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia who gets a house in this small town in Iowa and changes her identity .... of course there is no mention of how she got the money for it, but at this point in the movie I didn't care much. She meets a man (Mr Nice Wimpy) and falls to him and her husband eventually comes to her, but not before he rearranges her soup tins and straightens the kitchen. This was supposed to give me a cheap excitement for the audience. But I don't care much about being an abused woman, as the film, as I said, cheated on the audience. If it stayed the course, I felt for her and her situation. Of course, the man is killed and everything is good for little Grandma Roberts. If the real world was just around here .... See the burning bed and you understand what a movie would be to be about the subject of domestic abuse.
