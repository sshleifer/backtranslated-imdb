Take 'Rambo', mix in a few 'Miami Vice', cut the budget about 80% and you have something that some ten-year-old boys can come up with if they have a big enough backyard and too much access. to "Penthouse." Cop and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as eager as they come) are recruited to get an American super tank stolen and hidden in Mexico. Trapped with the tank was hardened Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain's former love Devon (Fluegel), the officer in charge and now meat for the depraved terrorists / spies / drug herds, who have no sense of thoroughness, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with depraved sex, there is a lack of action and not much sex. The running joke is that McBain is shot and survived all the time, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently, the authors did not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("The man for us is the one who gave him the face"), and also didn't think to give McBain even a precursor to intelligence. Even for budget action, the production values ​​are poor, with anticipated shots during dialogue and very little movement. The main prop, the tank, is stupid enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who may have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she has a much bigger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) Needs to be terrified of kicking off and back at a moment's notice. Jones, who is in an incredible variety of movies, is really down here. Both he and Busey were probably just for some easy money and a few laughs. Look at talented future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat," Once Upon a Time in Mexico ") in a stereotypical, threatening part, much to sow even for a guilty pleasure," Bulletproof "is still noisy enough to if you leave your home, but want people to think there is someone at home.
