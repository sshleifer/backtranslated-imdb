I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1. <br /> <br /> This story is very boring, and it has little to do with the original Timecop. Many things from Timecop have been deleted, and they are posting instead of new stupid things. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timing is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And the action scenes are nothing to be happy , most of them are not ... just the first one is good ... and there aren't many action scenes, and they're all pretty short. <br /> <br /> At one point in the story, the main character moves through time about 5 times within a few minutes ... no wait, make it twice ... <br /> <br / > In short: Don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it.
