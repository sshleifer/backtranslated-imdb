THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove code) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br / > (35mm and 70mm release prints) <br /> <br /> A blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) hears an extortion plot outside of a genetics research laboratory and later teams with a co-reporter (James Franciscus ) To put a series of lab killings, subconsciously placing their own loved ones for the sake of a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> In production stumbled upon the unexpected worldwide success of its director debut THE VOGEL WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento has the CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo thriller in the same way considered his forerunner, celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden, fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) and the emerging star Francis (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - which claims the advertising has been "nine times more exciting" than "Bird" - is a disappointing succession, impeccably photographed and stylishly performed, but too bursting and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Francis are excellent in sympathetic roles, and the movie Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD IS ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to spread the hi-tech world in which Argento's dark sad scenario unfolds. but the subplot with which Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTIA), since Francis's romantic interest is far more than unnecessary stuffing. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a busy train station (edited with a slender assurance by the cult movie-martial Franco Fraticelli) and a nightly episode in which Malden and Francis are an important guide in a bud burial and the prey fall on the killer's devastating machines. But despite the shimmering sheen, the movie deliberately moves from one scene to the next as it gently simulates without ever boiling. It is not surprising that "Cat" did not release the "Bird" run-off success in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
