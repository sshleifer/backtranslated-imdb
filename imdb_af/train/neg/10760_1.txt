This "movie" is the highlight of everything bad about modern film. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary turning / jumping / somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue ... basically unnecessary. (Is that a word? Well, it's just been invented by me, Robot.) What happened to practicality? (ie the garage, the skin spray) is the only tool that combines futuristic and realistic features, swipe the ticket at the coffee shop. <br /> <br /> What showed respect for women? (ie smith's character does nothing but soften the doctor for the better part of the movie, but she still wants him. WHO IS THE TENSION? I'll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground ) /> <br /> What happened to a detective who was tracking? Smith did nothing, but turned around and felt sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something a thought was going on, he was gone. It's such a lame way to get the story of point b-c-d etc. It was OK once, but not a few times in a row. (Speaking a few times in a row, what was the "I snur and don't listen to your joke?" Twice in one scene?) What happened to the little parts in a movie that makes sense? and not just a rescue panel tool? Shia LaBeouf (the child) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he breaks down women and B-he knows Smith ....... so from COURSE we have to care for him and whether he or she is busy is to do damage. <br /> <br /> What happened to Hero's? Let us just forget that there are people, women and children everywhere who are attacked by robots and selfishly the only person who sees me that I have knowledge and why he had to raise his bicycle through the air while on the one or the other. other way within a few seconds on foot at the same distance. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a show. But I'm also all for a little realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have to say I've never laughed so hard on a movie for a long time. so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the swing of social sling back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler everything else in movies ...... but especially simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Movies: "You Must Die So"
