A model called Laura works in South America when she is kidnapped by a gang of her hotel room and placed in the jungle. They are asking for a huge ransom for her release. Peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus for him if he can return the money as well as the girl. Peter is taken by helicopter to the jungle with friend Jack. They are trying to pay the kidnappers money in exchange for Laura, but the plan goes awfully wrong and they have to sponsor the helicopter. The helicopter is being shot and they must also give bail (not so far). Also the jungles are a devil of sorts. In fact, it is just a mere black man with strange eyes and a breathing problem. He began to kill some of the kidnappers and Laura just escaped to be caught by some primitive. The rest of the movie is a bit of a blur. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a massive Jess Franco fan, and so far it's just the second movie she's seen, but even I can say it's really not one of his best efforts is not. The movies are moving at a fairly slow pace without even happening. The whole thing could be downloaded fairly easily in a 25 minute TV program. There are far too many shots of people walking through the jungle, which could only be highlighted straight. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is poorly lit (Infact I do not think it was bright), badly named, poorly acted and slow, but for some reason it did not bear me. I think the main reason for this was the hilarious bad scenes in it. For example, a scene where Laura is walking down the street is shot in a real street, as crowds are not staring straight at the camera as his shooting. Another funny scene dribbled one of the gangs killed in a tree that drops blood because one of his friends is standing right under him and screaming for what looks like minutes. Then the man in the trees' head does not fall and the man falls under him. It must be seen to be believed. Then of course there is the real devil. It's just a naked black man who, despite having massive eyes, has a very vague vision. <br /> <br /> The movie was refurbished in part of the video scared in the 80s here in the UK and was banned. Now why was it, I have no idea. There are very few gore and this is hardly a shocking movie. Minus the nudity I would have said it could almost get away with a PG. The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and added to the original list from mouth to mouth. <br /> <br /> There is not much reason to see this movie really, unless you're a massive Jess Franco fan. There is a lot of nudity not to let you fall asleep, and also some screens that are so bad can be a good laugh for them, but otherwise I would say that just for a ticket to South America pays and gets lost in a jungle. It will probably be better. <br /> <br /> 3/10
