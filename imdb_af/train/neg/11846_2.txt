After watching this movie, I complained to my local theater about the quality of the soundtrack or whether the theater sound system could be faulty. For at least the first half of the movie it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the background of the music and the scratches of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the theater equipment, but not so - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I said the subject of my complaint was an essential part of making the movie. The music and the sound had to be twisted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. Nowadays, directors are making a lot of effort to make their movie unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you watch the movie, the sound score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find elsewhere), the soundtrack distortions are in themselves a good reason to miss this movie. You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the soundtrack and certainly not a cat's stomach.
