This movie is so bad it is funny. This is Scott Backula as a coach, but it's not important. What matters is the big black fellow who plays 1st base. First, he must be at least 75 years old, but he still plays less league baseball. Second, he starts the film overseas, though he can't walk, let alone run. Coach Backula moves him brilliantly to first mention that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for a long time. Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategies at the end of the film, (SPOILER), he tells his star player "center" to hit a home run, clearly "center", considered it a good move. He made the home game and won the match for his team, a minor league group playing the Twins, which was the class of the majors in the movie. Now if only Roy Muser, Tony Muser, will be such a coach as Backula and will tell his players that they will only hit a house in each bat, the Royals will never end, let alone lose a game.
