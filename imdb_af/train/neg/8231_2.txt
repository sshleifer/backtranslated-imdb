MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ... BUT DOUBLE CAN BE FOLLOWED. <br /> <br /> Five Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amassies. This movie tries to be the best of most movies by the 'Blair Witch' type filming .... it doesn't work .... it just ends to look and feel like someone has a cheap video camera, a of and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist gets no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian carries a power pack compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak ... just the sound of shouting and crunching. The whole film takes place in a van which means that decent scenery is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what they are given, but in general it appears as pretty terrible actresses ... although with the material being given, it is difficult to judge whether they can actually .... they Spending the whole movie screaming, screaming and frightening ... so much so that half of the time it's hard to figure out what was said and the cameras are so bad, it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video paints like a violent torture movie but is actually just five girls in a scarecrow bus that literally summarizes the whole movie ... we then get to the end of what looks like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls still live ... with one minus a finger. The only thumbs up (get it ... finger .... LOL) is for the poor actresses who have tried hard and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after making this terrible movie. Don't judge it by the poster. You will drop a lot.
