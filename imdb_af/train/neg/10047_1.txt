I've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and that's one of the worst. An interesting starting point at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll. If you see people they'll never make in real life, you'll entertain ("let's look out for the basement!") Then it's your show. Besides, it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The size of the virus is never ever shown. I can very much ignore the fact that it only affects men, as the resulting situation is very frightening. But then things are deteriorating, because the daughter immediately chases the father into the house and eventually dies at his hands. The woman flies north, and walks in a few tens of situations. Then there appears a kind of spirit or alien or something and saves her (things that make you go HOW?). Or something. Then she bumps for warmth. The end. <br /> <br /> Awful. These directors send this letter.
