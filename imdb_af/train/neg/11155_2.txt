The only reason I even looked at it was because I found it at my local library (and will ruthlessly reproach them for wasting public money on it) and despite the plethora of tits and ass it didn't take long Realizing that the Fast-forward button was my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-near-negotiable, chintzy effects, and one of the worst scripts I had the displeasure to see, came to life (as it was, terribly paralyzed and mutilated) a long, long time. Best laugh actually comes from the "Making of ..." featurette, in which the poor juice was involved in this HDV effort to justify their lame efforts as if they were doing something special, rather than something that wouldn't be quite forget about next week. Wait! Except that someone, in one way or another, attracted Tippi "The Birds" Honor, of all people, to do a little, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How it happened, I will never know, and to be honest, I really don't care. Look at your own risk and don't say you're not warned. It's movie-up at its pretentious, craven worst. It only gets a 2 of me for some pretty naked women, and even then, just scarce.
