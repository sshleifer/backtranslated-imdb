The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not ugly at all (actually she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message it wants to convey, this movie is not ridiculous. <br /> <br />
