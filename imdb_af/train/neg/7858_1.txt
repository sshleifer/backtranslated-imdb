I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for this kind of horror movie, but they should hire at least some proper actors. The sergeant is especially guilty of using his monotone bulldozer every single line he has. But let's see, the lines aren't really important. There is not actually a recognizable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other different poor language instead of proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> The 'story' as it is, mostly consists of seemingly random gore and death, with some surprising warnings. It happens about 10 minutes after you see exactly what is going to happen. Not only that, but there are some spectacular plot holes and continuity errors (why are they going in there? Didn't he have a weapon? Wasn't he dead?), So the whole movie looked like it cut through the few hours it will take to fix them. <br /> <br /> Another movie that only relies on blood and gore instead of any real movie experience.
