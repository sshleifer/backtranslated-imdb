The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of aversion or aversion." If anyone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know because it's the best I can come to. However, I do not feel that this word in any case describes how truly horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with two of my roommates. The one has very similar taste to me, the other is an action / adventure movie guru. The latter usually does not change the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains many explosions, it will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> It is said we entered the Friday Watch Theater. from alone in the dark Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why right away. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it just gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll that is being told. Yet I understand why it was told. The director must understand that only illiterate people will even see the idea of ​​PAYMENT to see this movie. Yet this first scene is not only the longest scroll in the history of the theater, but it does not make sense either. We seem to hear in the same order to separate completely separate films. One is about an ancient civilization and its toddler with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his orphans' experiments. If you read it and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then start the terrible storyline, acting, effects and camera work. Tara Reid is terrible as an actress. She does nothing to make you even think for a second that she is a museum curator. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst ever created by man. The whole time and the roommate with similar tastes ask questions like: What is it? And what's going on? Unlike this leaf litter, we have some narrated rows by Slater himself. Is this good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. Do we, at any stage as an audience, have the slightest insight into why we should care what happens? Again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at no time do they even care about the other. But then BAM ... sex scene. Again I don't know. <br /> <br /> A good, oh I don't know, 30 seconds after that tricky scene, we end a 20 or so military rifle and a similar number of strange things. It is on a heavy metal track and causes more brain bleeding than ever thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that wasn't enough <br /> <br /> There is no main villain. There is the scientist and there are "strange" things. At one point, the scientist controls the strange things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the commander of these things? Why are they listening to him? Again I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the strange things break through? Did the army tell them? Who knows ... and at this point caring? I didn't do it and you won't. <br /> <br /> But to solve this, Slater and Reid are attacked by a strange thing. Although it is said that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's the middle of the * &% $ day and it's bright as it can be. Perhaps the alien thing bought some sunglasses, I don't know and I don't care. <br /> <br /> Now, after the movie ended, I ran out of the theater, already 6 feet 6 inches from me, blowing my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to see this movie. Even my gung-ho action / adventure roommate (who watched a movie that only saw 2 hours of blast in a movie to be the biggest thing ever created) admitted that the plot holes in this movie are very clear was. <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST, I give it a 0.0 / 10 and lower it than I can. <br /> <br /> Unmistakably, the worst movie ever made. I do not want this movie to be my worst enemy.
