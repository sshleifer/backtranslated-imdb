... but it will make you wonder if we had anything in the first place! This movie is just as bad as any of the terrible horrors of today. A man walks around to spray semi-dressed ladies and tries to decide which one to kill so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man who spends a couple of minutes sitting on the set and covering everything that should be good about ten liters of blood. The movie also tries to create a feeling that what the man does to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the film is so badly done that it is impossible for the audience to soften any sense of shock or indignation. Cute dark and unimaginable sinister, this movie can't even get its own title - the initial credits say, "The brain that wouldn't die", but the end credits call it the head that wouldn't die.
