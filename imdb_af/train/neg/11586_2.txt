A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie. There is no escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. But even a fan, I can't help but see this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even an attempt to build an interesting story and strong characters. By now they just gave up. They didn't even try. They are of course the production, and hope for a few easy dollars. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't take your attention. It's so simple it's almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor of part 4, is now pregnant. Freddy comes back through the baby's dreams. At first we learn that to stop him, Alice must find his mother. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly because there's so little plot, which makes it a bit boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and horrible acting. In fact, this is the only scary thing, acting, as death is not even cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we can't care less for them. <br /> <br /> The girls are as unattractive as possible. The whole role reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I saw better actors in school games. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages a few classes. She is beautiful, sexy and has talent. But the material just made her shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins's work is nowhere near Renny Harlin's brilliant direction in Dream Master. He tries a few imaginative shots near the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven have created so well in the previous movies is not true. <br /> <br /> The Dream Child is just another unattractive successor. It's the kind of movie that gives horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end to Freddy's once scary. It's too sad to see him now. A clown that is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
