This movie was released on DVD recently in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find jewel. It even came with original theater previews of other Italian horror classics such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the previews were the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" in a bizarre way is actually linked to the notorious Lucio Fulci "ZOMBIE" franchise that began in 1979. Similarly to "ZOMBIE", "ZOMBI 3" consists of a sad plot and a handful of extremely bad actors who barely keep this horror wreck. The gore is almost non-existent (unless one is afraid of people walking around with green moss on their faces) and English dubbing is a notch under embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The plot this time involves some kind of secret military operation with a bunch of careless scientists (ie an idiotic man and his silly female silk speed) who develop a kind of chemistry called "Death One" which is supposed to revive the dead. Unless my ears need to be checked, I don't even remember a REASON for investigating "Death One". It seems that EXIST only causes destruction on the poor souls, which made the mistake of choosing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Death One" is experimented on a body (who I swear looks like Yul Brynner), and after being injected into his system, he sits upright and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite hilaries. As the face of the corpse shrinks with green, the sound of 'paper crumb' can be heard. The "Death One" toxin is transported outside and is used by a group of thieves with a number of thieves, after which it comes down, but infects itself after cutting itself on a bare bottle. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the guy gets into a zombie, but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel, infects a low doorman and kills a girl by her face. press a bathroom mirror. The military catches the wind and acts immediately before anyone who is unhappy to be in the "pollution zone" turns off and turns the motel upside down. They find the infected thief and burn his body, just to have the smoke infected, a herd of birds flying over the stack of chimneys. <br /> <br /> We cut the launch of a group of men who are on leave of the army, listening to 'groovy music' coming from a little dinky tree cabinet while leaning a trailer of malicious girls leaning out of the windows and protruding their boxes. Can someone say "zombie food"? We also have a subplot in which a girl and her boyfriend are driving, which drives a car that ceases to inspect a group of birds on the road ... the same birds infected by the 'zombie' smoke! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the boyfriend and drive the girl to an abandoned gas station to search for water. It is one of the incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. She walks around this old dirty, rusty and naturally deserted building where she asks aloud: "HELLO? IS THERE ANYTHERE? PLEASE, I NEED NOW WATER!" She meets a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall (!) And the other swings a machete. After a little rumbling and tumble on the ground, she escaped, but not before she inflates the gas station with her lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer whores and one girl is picked. and infected. They all go to the same motel where the original infection took place, and that is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. After a few hours (at most a day), the same motel is now in the dust, the vineyards grow everywhere and seem to be paralyzed for years. Anyway, what better place to hide than this particular building? Needless to say, the group is breaking down because several people go together to hold themselves in an incredibly stupid situation with a summer attack. <br /> <br /> The third most hilarious moment relates to a man and a woman who explore a deserted town, the woman says, "This place is a dump!" She then pushes a zombie into a balcony in a balcony in a pirahna (?), Where she cut off her legs and turns into a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile, her friend returned to the motel that had previously picked and infected, still a zombie !! Unfortunately, there are just too many contradictions in this movie that make this movie just too stupid for words. . For example, the duration of infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. Some zombies walk, others drag their feet and walk very slowly. Some even move kung-fu, while others hide under heaps to surprise people. Some of the zombies even speak! The funniest moment is, of course, the infamous "zombie head in the fridge" gig which airs him in the air and "attacks" a stupid man looking for food. Enoughly enough, his girlfriend tears her throat through his headless counterpart (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me, however, was the lack of stories that people were involved in. fact killed by zombies. We never see them coming back as zombies. In fact, the only thing we see is 'zombified', the one that is clipped by the birds, and the one girl who breaks down her legs. Other than that, I at least expected the couple killed in the kitchen and / or the man killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. It's also surprising that these zombies only take a few bits and then move to their next victim. <br /> <br /> Of course, the most laughing moment was the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who is infected lies on a bed in a hospital. A woman who has a lot of medical knowledge trying to deliver the baby (!) And pulled her face down by a zombie, before her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand erupted and continued to rip the rip rest of her face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The mechanomanic military officer, the pathetic, useless, scary women screaming to kill, the obvious characters who are about to kill (ie look for the man hunting a chicken!) I think this movie is really a comedy. There were many ridiculous scenes, such as the shed that was inflated with a hand grenade (of course the scene where the whole budget was spent) and a climate scene where one screamed: "I AM THIRD .... THIRD FOR YOUR BLOOD! ". The costumes are really bad - the same zombies appear in the course of the movie. They wear the same "Asian" clothes that appear in a Bruce Lee movie, and look out for the blue 60's dress, the girl at the motel is wearing as she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie opens the door as usual for the apocalyptic story. A radio DJ that plays throughout the movie seems to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Rare "DAWN OF THE DEAD" material if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this movie is very laughter. The gore is minimal, and what's there, it's very unconvincing, let alone, relentless. The usual mixture of black blood, thick green leaves consisting of crying sores and 'zombie makeup', consists of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" allows for a good rent for a remaining party or an evening of beer and popcorn. Other than that, horror fans have to stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
