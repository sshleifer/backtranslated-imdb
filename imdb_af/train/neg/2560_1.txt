Well, I watched last night and the one thing that didn't make it quite horrible was that it was straight ahead. There was no knock around the forest that this child was the Antichrist. However, the film was only poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dental incident an accident, or in the end how the policeman just ended wonderfully at home in time to save the child without the police still being mentioned. The dead screens were just really bad and not fun at all. The child they chose to play the Antichrist was boring and could really have chosen a better child. Just don't waste your time watching it.
