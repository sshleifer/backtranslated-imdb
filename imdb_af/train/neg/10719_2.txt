I wouldn't say it was completely sucked, but if it wasn't for Netflix, I wouldn't even have it in my house. Steve Martin's eccentric president of a chain healthcare store falls flat. He's just not funny. He has been rejected by another in a LONG SNL, which can only get work done for the next SNL movie. The birth coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it was originally. Amy Poehler just goes through the same movements she wants for a 7 minute SNL skit that's about as funny as SNL. The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easily on the eye. The end was predictable as soon as you heard her character could not get pregnant. The subject could be opened to other comedic attempts, but it seems to simply simmer, not really entertain or create.
