I never thought the standard of Yashraj movies would ever be so low! The film has a nonsense story that gets no interest. <br /> <br /> Saif was overworked. Kareena has improved her figure, but anyway, it's not a good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. May I say the role wasn't good. <br /> <br /> Much cheapness is filled. Wonder if it should be the "comedy part" of the movie. Just because the last few movies were flops, does that mean Yashraj movies have to make this kind of garbage? It has a history of so many good movies. <br /> Overall, I was completely disappointed with the movie.
