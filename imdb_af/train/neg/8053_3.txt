As a starting point, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise. <br /> <br /> But director Eric Red's inability to deliver a convincing hurricane leads to a flood of continuity and lighting flaws. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the viewer is more played by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. Intermittent wings of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, who does an 'innate' backwoods hardass'schtick, does his best to save the movie. But finally, Undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
