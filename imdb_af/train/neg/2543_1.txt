talk about your waste of money. I just wonder why Michael would die in such a turkey from a movie. Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie where he plays a man who dies of cancer. It was wonderful. As he confesses himself to his son to see it once, he grows up. Michael is so talented actor .. so what made him do one ??? I watched it and thought it was really stupid. I think they have the crappy movies at one time in their career. especially "The Squeeze" I didn't understand. And I feel his best performance was in Pacific Heights, his character really crawled me in. And I really enjoyed "Freedom". The one was so Hilarious !!! and he was just perfect for the role of "Batman" And I love "Night Shift" and I also like "Johnny Dangerous." Just too bad are some of them finally funny movies.
