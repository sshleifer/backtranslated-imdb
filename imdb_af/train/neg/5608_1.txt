I was curious to watch this movie. Many people look excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any kind of opinion or opinion. It doesn't matter to me, if Jesus existed as it was written in the Bible. If Mary was a virgin or not, or any other similar pagan coincidences. What makes me important is the idea of ​​redemption, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What made me angry is when someone takes a sentence, suggests it as a fact, but without showing the context it is written. For example, in this movie they showed the following sentence: "These enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and kill them before me" Jesus (Luke 19:27). What they didn't do I tell you is the context. Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no portion in the Bible where Jesus is deadly dead. He is love! When they have wrongly quoted the Bible, they propose to shout people (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. The majority of viewers do not look at the information presented, so they start thinking Jesus = hate = not good for me or for anyone else. It is purely manipulation people. Please use your brain. Don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own foundation, our civilization if we break down Jesus in this way and the message he has brought to us. You saw the branch you were sitting on.
