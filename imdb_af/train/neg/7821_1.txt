Did the filmmakers even preview it before they released it? The script jumps from place to place without much explanation. The beginning does not explain whether it is a prequel or not. It starts with Superman's beginnings on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but doesn't really warn the viewer. VERY confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home wreck, a stalker, and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes an interesting hero. The end is absolutely ridiculous. Superman who ended up in a hospital just killed me. I seriously wait for a SNL skit where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says: "The results are in - in the case of the child, Superman, you are the father." To summarize - OK acting through this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The movie is basically incompatible.
