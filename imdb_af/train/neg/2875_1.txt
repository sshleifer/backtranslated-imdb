This is the biggest piece of the crap ever. They seem to have made more time, effort and money to make the DVD cover than they did on the real movie. I really thought the DVD was put out with someone's homemade porn until I recognized one of the actors of the cover. This movie looks like someone who made it with a hundred dollars and a video camera and spent half of them on rats. The picture is really clear, but it, along with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it, production, acting, if it's actually what they do and script, if they have one, makes this movie look worse old porn. At least the old porn has a point. It seems like some PETA members have come together and decide to make a really disturbing, useless PSA about animal rights and feelings. So it's not worth the money or the time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer except the name of the killer and that of some of the victims. The people who made this movie should be glad he is not yet free, or he may have come just to make this movie so bad.
