My complaints here are about the film's pacing and the material at hand. Using archival films and letters gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material chosen to highlight is simply not very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or that disorder, or the obscene imagery of his small German hometown). Also, the film crawls along in the cover c. 1920-1939 and then steam through the war years. In short, the film is a little better than a documentary history channel, with the exception that the filmmaker has a little more sensitivity than your average history channel documentary editor, and can better arrange the artworks of the Goebbels. Yet I found it to be.
