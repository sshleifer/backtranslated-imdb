This film is simply one of the worst movies ever made and is a damning indictment of not only the British film industry, but also the talented hacks at work today. Not only did the film get mainstream distribution, but also a good actor of British actors. So what went wrong? I do not know and I do not care enough to get involved in the debate, because the film was so terrible that it is not thought of at all. Be warned and stay away from this litter. but I suppose I have to write ten lines of text in this review so I can just as well describe the plot. None of a man is compiled by his evil friend and co-worker from his father's company and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot movements / devices. I had to ask for my money back, but maybe I was still shocked by the experience. If you want a good crime movie, look at the usual suspects or the godfather, how about lock, stock .... it's the highlight of today's British crime film .....
