It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I was deceived into thinking it might be good, because some of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to face Jason Schwartzman for taking this role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I don't really understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in. I'm sure you can skim off the top and get the best. That way, the worst movie you're making is like Ferris Beullar instead of this slime. The gags love the hair doll and blatantly dismiss jeans advertisements added to the humorousness of the film. Glad I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that your January expenses should be avoided at all costs.
