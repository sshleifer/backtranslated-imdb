Our teacher showed us this movie in the first grade. I didn't see it. I just watched the trailer. Does it look like a first-rate movie to you? I do not think so. I was so scared of this movie, I could barely see it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain who cut the little girl in half, and then the boy was ketchup! I was scared by this movie. Now, today, if I'm 20, I probably won't feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should not see this movie, even though it is PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes to show it to children. I don't even remember what it's all about, once was enough!
