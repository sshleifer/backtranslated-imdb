Okay, when I came to the board for this movie, I really expected people to enjoy it. I was surprised to see people over the age of 7 like it. I enjoyed the movie ... but only my little sister and I (who is just 10) made fun of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jordan, but it was terribly terrible. You know a movie goes to the toilet when the head can't act. And it didn't even have a good script or plot to leave it. I also thought the character of Pamela was very lame ... border-lining pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even with that said, I thought there were some good actors, such as beautiful Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still not enough to leave the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie I just can't get: <br /> <br /> 1.) That Spencer man would fall for her. All right, uww. I looked up the dates and in fact he was only about four years older than her. The difference in "Go Figure" looks much larger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF she looked like 10 or 12 ... she looked like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) That there is any way Kristi Yamaguchi would just skate for one girl. I mean, I know Katelin is good and everything, but Kristi looks rather unlikely to go to a boarding school that doesn't even have scholarships, or that a school would have a skate coach with such connections. <br /> <br /> It's all said ... it wasn't the worst movie ever known, but it wasn't very good, even by DCOM standards, which I consider pretty low.
