Maybe I'm not so sophisticated. These and Closer are two of the more so-called cerebral films I have seen recently, and both suffer from the same problem in an ominous manner. That dialogue is false false. Nothing that comes from someone's mouth seems nearly credible. Perhaps the way this movie is set up is the way it's supposed to feel, but it was unshakable. And boring. I left the tedium after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will be holding Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen solution. If I ever come to this, I'll turn around and try to find Quincy's episode.
