It was a watery event in my movie to see life. I saw it in the theater when it came out. I was totally surprised at how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who picked up the money and who owes who a favor - a very, very big favor. The special effects are absolutely first degrees, as in any first degree it could. Toy rubber bats on ropes, without attempting to hide the strings, arrows appearing on the film and resembling the shape of an arrow you will find on a street sign, and a ridiculous story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every film student should just see this thing so they will know the definition of a bad movie.
