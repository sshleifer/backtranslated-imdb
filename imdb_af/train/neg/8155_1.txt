I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (like Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World, according to Garp). This is my favorite Robin Williams movie. But grabbing the day, though well behaved, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and definitely the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> Every good story is going to have its ups and downs. However, this movie is one giant. I don't need a good-looking Hollywood cheese party, but I need something other than 90 minutes of complete and total hopelessness. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
