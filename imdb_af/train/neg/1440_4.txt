Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; who grew up was my ultimate hero in films such as the 1952 "Scaramouche", the 1952 "Prisoner of Zenda" and the 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Swayze completely failed. Even the portrayal of a parent Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good at another big flop. Alison Doody also lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and lastly the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very difficult for anyone to fill his shoes !!! For someone who has been disappointed with Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I strongly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the Granger version.
