All right, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, though I'm lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I don't think this girl can do the least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen her is very hard to get past her fake play. It sounds like she's just standing there reading the script. This movie had just one good thing about it, and that is that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is so used and abused it is ridiculous. How many movies have the same kind of plot ?? Can we say, "Power of nature?" Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. I knew everything was going to happen before it did. It was a drill, but looking at Stiller is always a pleasure !!!
