Ulises is a literature teacher who comes to a coastal town. There he will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in town. They will start a fiery romance that will end in the tragic death of Ulysses at sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in town, living a quiet, happy life surrounded by money. One day, the appearance of Ulises will raise her passion and act without thinking about the consequences. The plot is pretty absurd and none of the actors play a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the movie is sexual acts, which are still well-filmed, are rather tiring, because we want to see more development of the story. It's just a bad Bigas Luna movie, with lots of sex, no argument and stupid characters anywhere.
