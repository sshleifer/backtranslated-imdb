I saw this movie, and at times I was dissatisfied to believe that this movie "saw me". Munchie will be the 'farce' for years to come. As a responsible parent (I'm talking to those now parents), I (you) won't let my (your) child go. ever part of this pseudo-occult video festival. To initiate, Munchie is satanic, to a fellow viewer, probably a chilled 'pigeon'. He is terrible, alien, agitated and totally malicious - as the Bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, enticing children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self-denial and prudent stewardship) . He is a leader of easy answers, and false ideals. He is all that the morally conscious viewer is not. He is the devil's own Ron Popeil. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean it literally and figuratively, with the emphasis on the former) that this movie didn't jump to the format. It is my hope that this kind of 'yellow film production' in the cold nights of 1994 in the cold nights died an unfortunate death. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention it. It comes a lot.
