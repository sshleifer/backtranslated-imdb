OK. So it's a low-budget "movie" (I use the quotes because it's shot in Hi-8 video). The play is universally horrible, the makeup is laughing (the blood looks like it comes from Sherwin-Williams and I saw more convincing bruises of Halloween ghoul kits) and the lighting generally looks like they are someone's borrowed Toyota bakkie used to shine headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I might forgive these low budget features if there was real content, if a movie attempted to tell a story. But this collection of video material boasts no plot, no real characters, and no momentum. It's a self-sufficient mess. <br /> <br /> Don't worry - no pampering here, because there's absolutely nothing to spoil.
