Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the spectacle's amazing couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction moves uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly believes the former and his self-centered performance in a small role underline the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. Normally I don't like to get myself so quickly understood, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books for all time, and to see what they did with it literally makes me crazy.
