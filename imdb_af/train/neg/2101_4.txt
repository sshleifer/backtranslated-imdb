Bernard Rapp died last year and was a very cultured journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a great worldwide dictionary of movies) and so he had to practice a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left received low warm reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996), despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp, was much caricature in the portrayal of the characters, "Une Affaire De Goût" ( 2000) was a nice thing, though Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverted performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another downward and "un Petit Jeu Sans Consence" is as overwhelming as its predecessors. The comic potential is exploited in a thin way. <br /> <br /> But the beginning idea lets a twirling, spiritual comedy predict. A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who have invited their friends are in full swing in a voluptuous home. Playing with their guests suggests sharing with each other. And things are not going as planned, because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers start thinking about the validity of their couple. <br /> <br /> Despite the sumptuous scenery and the promising material he has at his disposal, Rapp's incomprehensible direction cannot give life to this game. unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters that have specific familiar features and masks that are revealed about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. A bad edit blurs a bit more the movie with this bad habit of Rapp to cut many rows suddenly. Even the actors' sincere input into the business is questionable. They seem to be bored and have to recite their texts than to live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience will soon be caught in a deep downfall. <br /> <br /> It is a pity to say that Bernard Rapp's films have never lived up to his intentions, as "Un Petit Jeu sans Consentence" testifies.
