Just the most ardent DORIS DAY fan can even find this one bearable to watch. Thinking of the wealth of material available for a story about New York City's best-known blackout, a movie that handles many real stories about what people had to handle, it scraps the bottom of the barrel for a lack of story tells originality. <br /> <br /> Doris is again indignant because she suspects she could have compromised the blackout at night when she returned to her Connecticut residence, took a place to sleep and woke up in the morning with a man who did the same, accidentally wandered into the house. <br /> <br /> No one is able to save this mess - not Doris, not ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA. ALBRIGHT. As indicated by He Averback, it is the worst vehicle day she has found, committed to doing the movie because of her husband's turn and failing to get out of it. Sorry.
