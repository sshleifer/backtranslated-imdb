I usually don't read anything (I read the other opinions) ... but that, this one I have to comment on ... I was convinced to watch this movie through worlds such as action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff but just a few first minutes and I changed my mind. Lousy acting, lousy script and great science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Simple ... don't bother ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing, before any movie, I usually go to user comments and reviews on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try, now I'm wondering who is rating this movie by giving it more than 2 points ???? ??????
