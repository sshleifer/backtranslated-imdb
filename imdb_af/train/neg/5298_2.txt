I rented this movie because I was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one had heard and could be a possible jewel. I saw it and since I was a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It has the EM score which means: Extremely Adult. Think this rare and high rating was completely meant for violence and everything else, I got it. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge, and Nudity. The "extreme violence" struck me fancy. The movie has finally become a fairly easy slasher movie. It has one or two gory scenes, but I got worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of gore in a movie isn't all right? You also plot. Well, the plot is boring and there's nothing really special about it. Don't rent it. I speak the truth. I can't imagine how anyone can really enjoy it until the point they say, "I'm going to rent it again." It had moments where it kept you going, but I will never see that movie again.
