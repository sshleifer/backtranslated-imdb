This movie has a very simple but somehow very bad plot. The whole movie is about a girl being sucked by a gate to another dimension, and years later it is again opened by a witch while a group of friends (including the main actor experiencing problems with his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers with her new partner ... another girl ... that's right, they are lesbians and there are some nudity of course for no particular reason). Unfortunately, devil follows the now-grown girl again. Unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where were they exactly? Where does the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who trained hell and made her a gladiator type outfit? The play is terrible, but I think, but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad, maybe there was nothing they could do with it. I gave it a try because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun, even though they were very cheap. I wouldn't recommend it, it wasn't quite bad enough to be funny.
