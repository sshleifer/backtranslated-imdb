I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is overlooked and does not play the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith .... or rather her stupid, undisputed role. The real problem and lacking in this latest version is good writing, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater and watch this long, stretchy and particularly boring movie. There is more pause in the dialogue than a Pinter Play. In the book I feel deeply concerned with Catherine Sloper and her life. The movie had just the opposite effect. I also thought about where her aunt had a sexual appeal to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. Yuk. <br /> <br /> See if you can't sleep, it's a definite snoozer. Don't look at it if you're depressed. You will need Zoloft afterwards. <br /> <br /> Certainly, "The Heiress" was extraordinary with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor who played her father was about to be the unconscious, cold father .... still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for that. The film was not true to the book, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office flop. I have no doubt why.
