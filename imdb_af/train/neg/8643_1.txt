A Blair Witch-War Movie that was so much of a fall as Bwitch! The title says it all, saves your money and your time and spends it on a good movie such as "Once Upon a Time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you have a BIG look) war "movie" etc <br /> <br /> This movie, if it was a baseball team and the big leagues, was the apex and single A was the newcomers, then this movie was high school ball. It was filmed as if it were a high school drama club that filmed their father's old camera. Certainly, they went in a hostile area (to make a movie), but I don't call it brave, here we call the clear stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go look and then tell me what you think.
