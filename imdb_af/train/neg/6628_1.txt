If the scale were negative, I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director have spoiled any and all pleasure in this story. Choosing the angles, the choice of lighting and everything derived from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the songs and dances didn't even rip you off your ears. The movie could be made twice at 1.25 pm, and was pretty good, similar to "Seven Samurai", but the director and writer didn't go that way, even though the "village goers" eventually found their backbone and wanted to help them . This movie fails at so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, writing - call any aspect of this movie - that was BAD - probably the food of the caterer was also bad. I have never seen anything that made it bad in 6 years of watching Indian (Bollywood) movies.
