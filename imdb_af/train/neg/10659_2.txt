Filematography: Excellent, beautiful camera angles (I can't remember seeing a movie, with good close-ups to this one). Could have horrified scenes with a soft camera avoided. NY is well depicted. I had the upside corners, especially (another touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. Songs do not hold onto your mind, even after watching the movie. May be, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must break away from hard-core action rows. His age and stomach are really coming up. Also, he must avoid the nearby romantic rows. It was very uncomfortable to see an adult star still trying to play like a 20+ heroic scene. Love can be expressed at any age; As we get older, you can still express love in the distance (without touching a woman too much. For example, the love Rajinikanth expressed in "Chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika only appears to the closest in the movie. Not sure why she accepted it. Well, that's not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others only have a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected from Gautham to perform (or measure) his others. movie "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. It has taken a long time to leave the movie due to several problems. He slides in a few scenes. Even incomprehensible things slipped from a well-known director. <br /> <br /> Overall: Just a good movie. Too many graphics. DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN (and adults expecting some kind of "Entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
