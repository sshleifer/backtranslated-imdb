It is hard to think that anyone can find this short favorite if they have seen most of their shorts, but I know that humor is very subjective. I saw all their sound pants (by far the best of their stuff, IMO) and I found this one of their poorer attempts. <br /> <br /> In the year it was made (1930) Stan and Babe have 15 shorts and one feature. They were very popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of making them work continuously. In addition, it was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan. I would say it was an experiment that didn't really work. As someone else said, it doesn't play their strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about "girl" things. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny, watch Blotto, or Brats from the same year. <br /> <br /> They've made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for eliminating fewer than shorts. They made a total of 108 films. Very few (except those made at FOX) were live failures, but there are a few. County Hospital, Me And My Pal, The Living Spirit, The Fixer Uppers comes in mind as essentially weak. But otherwise, I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts. Totally a record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed their other shorts, then be sure that this one was less than memorable for Stan. and Babe.
