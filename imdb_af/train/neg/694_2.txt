It's the early 80's. There are a group of suspiciously cute teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is Slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I don't have the worst idea. Unless your idea of ​​a good prank is to repeat someone's meal with a baseball bat - on balance, not a good prank; In fact, it is quite a mess when the truth is told. But there you go. <br /> <br /> The film itself relates to a group of teenagers who have the job of cleaning a sleeping residence. They become aware that a psychopath is in progress. To combat this development, they divide and wander in the dark. It ends up in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a heavily slasher movie. The DVD version I saw was the Vipco one. It seems to be a fair share of violence. This makes the DVD even more meaningless, because we face it, a slasher movie worn out of violence is a waste of time. For slasher movie and video-nasty completists only.
