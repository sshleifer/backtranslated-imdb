What a scary movie. Don't get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from some interesting chapters, the movie is mostly recorded with hysterical submarines shouting, crying, sweating and generally freaking when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it with simplicity to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how to be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke) and you <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that the right core US Navy is not in the hands of such a script! <br /> <br />
