When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it couldn't fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were deceived, in the kicks. <br /> <br /> For my part, Billy felt Crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Certainly, he cracked some good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but took up space. <br /> <br /> A poor Julia Roberts. In the past, she played well as a strong, self-determined woman. In this movie she looks completely suppressed and has very little fire. It's not the Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watching. <br /> <br /> OK, if I could find one good thing, it should be Christopher Walken. Now it's fun. But, like Billy Crystal, there's almost nothing of his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of indifferent laughter with very little redeeming value, check it out. But if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, it's not your movie. This is not one of the above.
