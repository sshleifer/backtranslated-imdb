Belmondo is a tough policeman. He goes to a big-time drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a big villain - see "Sharky's Machine", but here he is clearly mentioned, and therefore he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the spectacular places of Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, saves some people, gets the names, goes to more rogue places, asks for more names, saves more people, and so on. The whole movie is punching after punch after punch. It seems as if the people who made it had no other ambition than creating the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 here, did some good stunts at the beginning; Apart from those, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, trite, level and forgettable cop movie. (* 1/2)
