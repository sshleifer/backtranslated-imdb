While renting free videos, I chose this one. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside the summary already given were this. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was gross and unnecessary. 2: There is some kind of soundtrack in the background of the movie that seems to be there all the time and with the way I felt days after the end of this rubbish, I found that they were something subliminal in the had a job. Either it or it was just traumatizingly bad or both. Many times throughout the film you can tell the author and director, you don't have much experience or talent. And don't ask about the acting first.
