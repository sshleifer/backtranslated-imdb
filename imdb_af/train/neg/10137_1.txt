First, f117 is no longer high technology and it is not a fighter plane. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the F14s and F18s can't change their appearance; they are not transformers. <br /> <br /> Third, the f16 only has one m61 cannon, not two. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, at the end of the movie, Seagle chose its sidewinder rocket. But somehow, when he pulled the trigger, the real missile was fired, apparently a maverick. As I have the experience to see F18's and F14's being mysteriously changed in f16's, this little transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me. But there is one more question I should ask: How did they use an air-to-ground missile to shoot a flying f16? <br /> <br /> When students really hand in poor work, teachers say 0. Now I think for the sake of correct marking of this movie, IMDb should seriously consider adding a '0/10' option. Otherwise, it's not fair for those who receive 1 in 10.
