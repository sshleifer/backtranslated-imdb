Casting leg to choose: David Jannsen was 38 and played Robert Drivas's father. Then he realized he was just outside the college, but clues in the script became a loafer and he was probably 24-25 in the writing --- which still puts Jannsen in parenting classes in Junior High. I suppose the AMA wrote medical miracle in their 1938 year in medicine. This movie is not very old and now it is the biggest appeal to just see a snap shot of Sin City, about 1969 and all the unceasing smoke, the strange hair (Drivas has an atomic comb that makes him look like A well-grown hip Cousin It) and trendy fashions that accompanied it. If anyone remembers, LV wasn't really London ... the city stole the crowd and codger in those days. Drivas come out as sexually ambiguous; his father thinks he is gay (in a sad irony he himself died of AIDS at 47) and the lethargic conflict comes from the gender gap problem (ahem, as if you could call a 7-year gap). Sonny boy wants to be his own husband and Dad wants to put him in the casino (Caesar's Palace!) And keep him with girls (including the horny-for-money Edy Williams). Interestingly, the boy doesn't look like a gay --- unusual for the time and a cute Brenda Vaccarro is platonic about him in the near future. What is counterfeit is terribly paralyzed - just needed to record the audience for an R-score in the early days of the MPAA rating system (which was then G-M-R [16] and X). The editing is surprising and the Committee (stupid 60-year-old neo-avant-garde comedy group who has disappeared from the ticket within a few years) is stupid Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer ... predicting him as a floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later. To give away nothing, but they would then with Mr. Rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert. A curiosity, far from Joshua Logan's usual caliber of work. Dos / Dias. Check out CASINO again ...
