For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can't believe what these people did for a perfect game. <br /> <br /> -Let's start with the good bit, will we? <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is good, although some of his dialogue could be delivered to more feelings. The rest of the actors needed to pull it together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why aren't you dead yet, Romeo? The actor, while not just completely wood and dead, could not read his lines at all. He was completely out of focus, even faced problems with Juliet, and absolutely NO grace with the lines he was given. Everyone who throws him deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost sensible, but she does not give in depth to her character, and seems completely out of touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and totally out of character for the whole dialogue. Benvolio was indifferent and ruthless with his lines. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The play was silent and the costumes were nothing but distracting. I saw kindergarten dolls with more trouble in them. I just wish I could give this movie a zero score.
