I saw most of my "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC film festival in New York and had to leave the theater because of nausea feelings coming up in me. I saw Hollywood movies, and I watched satires from Hollywood movies. This movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be, so it finally got a joke on itself. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been copied liberally from movies such as Bride and Bias and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy lazy job about it. How can Bollywood ever be weaned from its determination to stick to overused, well-married scripts? Is there no one to bring to the screen the millions of real, fascinating stories that are likely to exist and in the land of a billion people? The exaggerated car driver, the cow on the street, free scenes of strange places, useless scenes of Mumbai streets, they're all there. Every possible clich√© about India is faithfully included. So sickly predictable. ugh !!! Acting performances are poor on board, except for Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why she would choose such a project.
