Bobby is a goofy kid who wants too much smile and sex. So he buys a van to help in this quest. The play is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the writing is no more than a unbuttoned chain of clichés and cheap excitement. The film's creators, of course, wanted to capture the folly of other films of the time, but had a long way to go. They even lure Bobby on a banana sheet, as it will probably add comedic value. <br /> <br /> I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he's just a supportive actor and there for cliché value.
