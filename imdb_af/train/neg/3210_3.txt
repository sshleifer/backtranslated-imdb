There is really no way to beat the forest to say it, Lady Death: The Motion Picture is just sucking. Apart from the fact that the main character is a well-equipped blonde running in hell in a leather bikini, with occasional traces of graphic violence, the film appears to be the mentality of a 1980 cartoon based on a series of action verbs. The bad man himself speaks even like a Skeletor wannabe, has the mandatory unchallenged handman, and lives in an army that looks to the domain of the villain out of the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Don't expect any other humor than the sometimes bad bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime story that is better suited to hentai, but there is no sex, no tentacle rape (thank you!) And very little sex appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. In essence, we have here an episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.
