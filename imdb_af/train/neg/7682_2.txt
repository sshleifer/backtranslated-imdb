Expressed in 1955 The COBWEB is an all-star cast ranging from the silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to the Actors Studio Progeny SUSAN STRASBERG. Ask an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about you wondering ... high drama? Doctor & patient relationships? Shock therapy treatment? No, this cry is about who will get exactly to choose the curtains for a psychiatric hospital! You think I'm joking? You will not believe your eyes if you watch this amazing story that has changed in a movie! Progressive head shrinkage Dr McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants all the hospital's patients involved in the design, selection and execution of the necessary new curtains. McIver's wife played with marble. GLORIA GRAHAM also wants to get her 2 cents on this monumental task. So do the long time staff Miss. Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you wonder if he really got so much involved in the small detail because of his marriage to worry, JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors such as LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are being wasted in this hokey story. What do they think?
