My roommates & I almost cut our TV short of the many spitting tasks we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970's self-important pseudo-zen. I've been reading this festival for centuries and scanned my local TV listings for years to find this elusive ride. A few years ago, our local ABC affiliate was known to show cool flashes for his nagnag movie (ie "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). Then it happened one day: at 1:40 on a Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) it was! We have over 15 people left and the movie has NOT disappointed! <br /> <br /> See! Andy Griffith as the silliest and most unpleasant bad guy since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> See! William Shatner sports a variety of things on top of his head that look just like human hair (or something organic). <br /> <br /> Hear! jawbone in the seventies sounding like "making chicken soup for the soul" like BF Skinner sounds. <br /> <br /> Feel! Content that was better than the 70's any decade. <br /> <br /> For those who still read, the plot encloses a lot of middle-class middle a-holes that decide to suck their s --- main boss (Griffith) by joining a cross dessert race covering California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets, look more at Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way they stop at a Cantina, get drunk, smoke joints (face Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes a joint is an image you won't soon forget), start a fight, attempt rape and just like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs. Although I have an excellent copy of TV, I wanted to release this one on video so that the whole world can enjoy its half-leaf goofiness.
