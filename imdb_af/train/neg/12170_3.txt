No wonder Pamela Springsteen acted as a full-time photographer; It's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than before. While this movie is not without its interesting elements (mullets of hell, etc.), it is burdened by mistakes. For one thing, Angela, the murderous counselor, seems about the same age as the campers. With an older, more threatening camp director, much would have done for the movie. And then you have the murder tones. The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (no pun intended), although someone in an outdoor toilet is drowned, it is definitely original. But in general, there are a lot of movies out there that are scarce / more fun to watch half an hour of your life.
