They screwed this story! In the end, Nell is all heroic and takes the team to save all their asses from Hill House and such a bunch of nonsense! They cut heads, cut people's faces, and turned the ceiling into a huge hand! What the hell is it about ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book is so good is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There are no gores. There is no ceiling hand. It's just the ghost ad how ghost can really kill one. They can't kill us, they can't throw us over the room or fly a knife in our head. No. They can only make us angry. To take away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for herself. Yes, she does give a little to the other, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont made a shit on this wonderful story! I hate this damn remake!
