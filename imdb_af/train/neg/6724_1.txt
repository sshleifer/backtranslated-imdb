If you choose a movie, do I hope that one factor you will consider is using the actors in the movie to influence their moral substance in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that has consequences for society. When a comedian / actor curls sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father, should we ask (do I support that behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx's behavior in the social tissue that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior of the bad that love-friendliness is better than hate. Mr. Foxx must remember that he is just entertained and there are many out there to choose from. To say sorry, don't get him off the hook. It won't make the pain unnecessary or remove the bad behavior it spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. Don't see anything they are sharing anymore. We can't change them, but we can stop the fame we give.
