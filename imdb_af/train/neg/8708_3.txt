Like all Carnosaur movies, it's a joke. The way the dinosaurs move, reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls, because they can't look stiffer or fake as they were. <br /> <br /> The plot had no sense. I mean, first they are on a bus, then in a warehouse then, suddenly, they are on a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that some dinosaurs can stay together on a bus or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving order. It sounds silly even if you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it a 3 is because it's still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (haven't seen the second yet). Just don't rent it. I saw it on TV and that's a good thing I've done because I didn't want to waste money to rent it.
