No spoilers here, but I was a fan since Waking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 are so far, is terrible. The stories do not match the original idea of ​​the series. I found this 3 in the last series of jaw droplets ridiculous. As a BBC license payer, after the show I got BBC complaints to pass my disappointment. I am surprised that the actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not object to the story lines. These actors are with these characters for 8 seasons, but they can see it's completely lost. It's a good job, it's the last series or the next series can start with the team that investigates Father's death! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
