"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (an incredible covenant title) is simply a bad movie; It has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special about it. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoyingly soft focus. In addition, the film uses the same music as, say, "Gilligan's Island" or the Scooby-Doo cartoons - it never happens. Terribly, simply terrible. There are also no new ideas, just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc, of pieces taken from older movies and magazines. There's no gatekeeper here, the movie just seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not entertainment.
