Less than 10 minutes in this movie I wanted to end it because it was painful. All this "horror" movie was about a group of wolves bitches who do silly things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Don't let the positive reviews deceive you, because it's really a terrible movie and you really shouldn't see it. <br /> <br /> The movie has the potential to be good, but it doesn't. A group of five "teen" girls drive home one evening when they are found by a crazy female driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes in the movie, and the characters are already calling and stopping. All we have for 90 minutes is a lot of girls crying, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. Neither of the dialogs is even interesting from a distance, so you can't really know or enjoy these characters. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and I was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women watched a day under 20, and one of them seemed to be almost 30 years old. At least people get to look at age. None of them even delivered distant proper performances, and just looked as if they were plugged off the street or were friends of the director without acting abilities. The "actress" played by the killer did, but at least she showed something the other girls didn't do - a little talent. <br /> <br /> The characters don't help things, because these girls are a lot of spicy, stupid tits. That's all I can really say about them, and it didn't help them survive ALL. If I have to go in detail, the girls are chased in one scene by the killer and their car has beaten much. One girl injured herself and looked at it ... four of them don't wear seat belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer ... and you just happen to be comfortably too hurt to help? Whatever. <br /> <br /> Filming the movie is absolutely horrible. I don't care if this movie had the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like a pirate version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed somewhere on a window and the number of times the camera had dried out, was shaken and brushed against an "actress" was terrible. It was also grainy, and sometimes you couldn't hear what characters were saying (not that it was worth listening to). <br /> <br /> Presumably, the killer car in the movie (supposedly hit, even though we just heard the accident) is actually the real-life director car. No wonder they didn't hit the car! This movie is so cheap they can't even show a car to scratch a little. Oh, also call the soundtrack ... if that's what it was. It was a pity ... sad one second, then hard rock the next. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes feels like a horrible movie filmed in the middle of the road, while a lot of stupid girls scream and scare for 90 minutes. It does not help when the fright is terrible, the fright / tension / tension and (barely any gore to make it) are absent, the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming is terrible. <br /> This was a horrible low-budget movie. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
