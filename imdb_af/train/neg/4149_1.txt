Dear me. Where do I start? The father is not close enough elsewhere to be the girl's father. He lights up camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The beneficiary exclamation in this movie is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are clever, stupid and low and far between. Motives are completely incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People 'rush' to their destination in jeeps managed at 3 MPH. The world seems to be going on as normal, but it is supposed to be the end days. Brushes appear for the sake of breasts. Normally, such an approach would offer a little relief, but the rest of the film really made me unimportant in the breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog without reason and thin, orange blood that changes the stomach. The general and his "Shut the f ** k up!" is the only salvation function. As for the rest, I hope to hear that they have done the decent thing and killed themselves.
