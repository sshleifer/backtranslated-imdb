The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating movie to watch. Infuriatingly enigmatic, it treats every shot like a work of art. You get the impression that the composition of each shot is designed and prepared with some outstanding care that obscures; Exactly how far the theater has progressed since the first films were taken out in the nineteenth century and imitated their construction, the camera barely moves here ?? apart from during the camp and colorful music numbers. Surrounding noise is kept to a minimum and there is hardly a word spoken. This curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that even if the story progresses to a snappy pace, we feel we are immersed. Unfortunately, this immersion starts at least somewhere around the hour point. I began to feel as if the movie challenged me to watch while getting harder as the minutes dragged, so the mere act of watching became a will camp. <br /> <br /> The content of this movie wasn't as sexual as it was, it would undoubtedly be even more obscure for Western audiences. As it is, there is an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious (or possibly dead) woman who is so distressing that, while it can speak volumes about the degradation that pornography subjects both men and women (the users and the users) are so keen on the way it prefers to make its point of making it effective. Of course, the worst and most enthusiastic participants in the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this movie for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the remote control's quick button. <br /> <br /> For all its problems, the movie is definitely a resident, and the more you think about it, the more sense certain aspects are. Ironically, for a movie in which so little happens, the viewer is likely to be rewarded proportionally by watching a second or even third time. But for me, was that enough?
