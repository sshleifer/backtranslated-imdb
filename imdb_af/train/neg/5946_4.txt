There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no climax ... nothing. But have some good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So there you go ... if a movie is generally pretty bad, but if you want a mindless movie that offers nothing but good action, then watch this movie. Don't expect anything more, just that thing. A little acting and a not so bad direction. " A few blankets by Kimbo and Carano. I was looking for Carano a little more in this movie. She's a good fighter. and a very hot girl .... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art. Put together a movie with White and Jaa ... it'll be great.
