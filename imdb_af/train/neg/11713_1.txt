Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen for years ... I couldn't see it to the end ... It's a pure waste of time ... I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There really isn't much to say about it. Terribly acting, incredible bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would recommend watching this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be. To tell just one scene: Police are looking for Snipes, and they are encircling the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting inside the building, but still whispering, so Snipes don't suspect.
