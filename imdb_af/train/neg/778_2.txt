What has Ireland ever done to film movie dividers that they want to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This movie begins as a primer for film students on Irish cinematography: unsaturated priests, spits for handshake, Marching March, city bike riding in the background of anodic folk music. However, it soon becomes clear that the main theme of the movie is the great daddy of the Irish cliches - religious strife. It's about a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic father was educated, who seems to have a reasonable enough desire, though not for the 50's County Wexford villagers to live on. Rather than sending them to a Catholic school, she decides to act and go to Belfast, then Scotland, where some claws are being reconsidered. While she is there, her father (who looks honest like George Lucas) and family is back at home with a boycott that gets very nasty. I'm not going to end, because I think people should see this movie, but it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we have to sympathize with her, but end up getting her instead of getting a life. The residents are presented as bigots whose prejudices have to be raised, but traumatizing your children seems to be an improper way to go about it. In addition, it takes the burdens that disturb it when trying to reconcile with the current Northern Irish peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she must "write conditionally" for her return. The film is allegedly based on a true story, but the themes have been increasingly imaginative, with less use of past clich√©s.
