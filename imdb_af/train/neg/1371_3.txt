I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie so badly. It's like the TV station is desperate for anything, anything. They are buried under a lot of snow, the electricity still flashes on and off, but magically there is a backlight that remains constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? That, and all that stupid between the characters. They seem to be more interested in each other to complain than to try to find ways to survive. It tries to create the emergency and help people. But because it is such a bad direction and action, you will not fix your Florence Nightingale with this movie, sorry. I'm joining the negative feedback, and I agree that it's one of the worst movies ever.
