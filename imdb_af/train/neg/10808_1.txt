I was given the Kazaam book version for my 8th birthday, and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's soon over. <br /> <br /> The play in this is horrible, which I expected from a movie with Shaq, playing a magical rapping genius that comes from an old ghetto blaster (which was probably a good reason that he is trapped there). The child in the movie Max plays is clever and a terrible actor. He is bullied by nearby children, which I am not guilty of, because he is a bit of a bag. <br /> <br /> The story is just stupid and very clich√©. About a boy whose dad is always working around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his dad. <br /> <br /> Even at 8 years I thought it was a stupid idea. It is a surprise that any of the people who worked on this film had careers for wards, as it was an embarrassment and never had to be made. I can even fly around more about how this movie sucks, but you just have to know it by just reading the plot.
