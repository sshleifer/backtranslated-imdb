Really, when it comes, this movie is just not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of funny, yet he thinks he is hilarious. The plot to send the 17 letters was first fine, until Josh's "look at me, I'm wacky" approach, infected every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been the least funny thing I ever participated in, and it says quite a lot, as it has solid competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And for the incredible overuse of the Pixies "Debaser", I have only one thing to say: What did the Pixies ever do to earn such a fate? What did someone do with Josh Kornbluth to let him write / direct / produce / star in such a terrible movie?
