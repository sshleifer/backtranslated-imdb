A famous showmaster comes with his girlfriend in the elevator. Suddenly she killed him and walked away while an old woman was having a heart attack. The name of the female killer is Sawa. She goes to school and works for a cruel criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day Sawa finds out he killed her parents. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this evil action thriller is a disappointing gore festival. "Kite" has style, but it's still trash. The strange plot about a teenage girl killing people as an assassin tried to get scary and touch at the same time. It just causes the story to fall flat on its face. One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good / bad heroine Sawa, along with a bodyguard, falls, but the dramatic structure is not nearly as well orchestrated and director Yasoumi Umetsu's strange and grotesque animation of the character's faces. is terrible. Not only that, the associates are simply creepy. <br /> <br /> Degree: 3/10
