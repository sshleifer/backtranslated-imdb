This movie was craptacular. I was so emotionally unreliable in every single character that the movie's biggest antagonist was indeed itself. I played it all the time; I promise myself to leave, but just drink another beer and hope that it will automatically change magic into something wrong on the road. Even in this state, I can't help but notice that Cuba's play was so faint as record paper. His obsessive dedication to his work was undeniably done, as well as one night after the failure of his own idiotic standards. Burt came on the screen as a general, that's right, a general (wearing too much makeup). I had a terrifyingly fast attack on Cuba's rivals, except mine was real and I was beating myself. Retribution! Reimburse me stubbed!
