Terrible horror continues on "The Howling". It comes down to Karen White's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee unfortunately) is there and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) the main wolf. Ben and a colleague of Karens (Annie McEnroe) go with him. <br /> <br /> One horrible script, bad direction, improper editing and really horrible acting by Brown and McEnroe, this one sinks. The werewolf effects are usually kept in the dark - for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects too - although I thought like the cartoon lightning coming from Danning's fingers. There is also a waswolf lull that is particularly stupid and Danning retrieves her top at least eight times during the final credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things. I found the town in Transylvania amusing. It seems to have come from a 1930s Universal horror movie! There are interesting camera tricks between the transition screens; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at this - but they can't save it. Really - why did they do that? Where did they get out loud for money ??? This is one of IMDb's lowest rated movies. That alone must tell you something. Danning was probably terrified when she saw the movie - I can understand why! A must-miss.
