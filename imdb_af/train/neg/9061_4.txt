What can you say about this movie? It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good! Two days ago I watched Lillies and it was one of the best Gay movies I have ever seen. So it wasn't the best time to watch a mediocre Gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and the acting was OK. It wasn't bad enough to turn off, but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping. It wasn't that good either. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you will waste your time and money. I don't understand why movies like this are made and who they fund. Spend your time watching Noah's Arc on Logo. I think that's where this movie tried, but never got there.
