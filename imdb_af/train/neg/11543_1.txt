Although I use this site very often to see how other people have rated what I think are challenging or just enjoyable movies. After watching this movie on Film Four, I was forced to write something off, even though it only helped me. The movie was probably the greatest experience I ever had. The main characters by Danny Dyer (23? Or you?) And Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully if Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock). I'm not sure if the first half of the movie didn't make the final cut, but surely in a revenge movie, you'd like to have empathy with the victims. I can't care less here. In fact, the only character I care about was the dog, with the sting coming a close second. And both animals retired Dire (sic) and Scully, which was quite honest. I think even if you are as good as the writing you are given, and I would like to thank the writers, producers, the director and all the role players for 90 minutes of my life and some good electricity.
