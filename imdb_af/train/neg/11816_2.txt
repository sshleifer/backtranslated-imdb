Once saved with a ship, it is invaluable. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Zaphod Beeblebrox's Heart of Gold for salvation. It is also not the Parent of the Year observers. After condemning her daughter for two years on a deserted spacecraft, the mother encouraged her to get drunk and walk alone with the strange man they picked up.
