If I didn't read his name on the DVD cover, I would never have thought that this rather soft and old-fashioned musical was made by a man so closely related to the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from it, that I wonder if back in the 50's and 60's, New Wave authors would have absolutely hated this kind of movie - that's so ... so ... unreal. And it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. It is not necessarily a bad thing - just a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the judges gave to this movie - especially when there are so much better French musicals out there. The songs in this movie were simply not very interesting and the characters were all so sweet and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person frustrating how hard it is to be rich or get a good selling price on a designer outfit, I had a great time. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that like American musicals, not every French musical is gold. This movie is not another "Les Parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OR CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes"), and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can't see much reason for it as something other than a boring peculiarity not recommend.
