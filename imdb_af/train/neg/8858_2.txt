Ben an out-of-town police spokesman is convinced his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring her murderer to justice, but he is approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. So, Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan, travel to Transylvania to make this evil end. <br /> <br /> It's amazingly awesome B-grade stuff and I wondered how it's even released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, because it must be his worst performance. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of error with this real cheap ass film, ranging from the real hammie and wood performances of Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not forgetting Lee), cheesy fashion (those sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, humor ... if there was any trashy 80's music (with some of the movie just focusing on an unknown band game), weather wave has orgy an eye is to see and a tiring story with a flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was so bad it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives were the location and the settings of the movie looked good, but it's about ... actually I will also add Sybil Danning's short stripping scene. <br /> <br /> At the end credits the band plays their junk song during a strange montage of scenes from the film, which I question why? <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, but it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
