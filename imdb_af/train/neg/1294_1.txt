The central theme in this movie seems to be confusion, as the relationships, environment, acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element, lacking his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make matters worse, his character's name is 'Che', and we are told (directly by the narrator) in the film that he is not 'that', Che, just a guy named Che. The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and as soon as the family is divorced, the younger generation is divided into America. So clich√©. Other reviews discuss how the film depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; but the director's political attitude is at best uncomfortable and we are never quite sure who is responsible for bloodshed. So they lost their property (gained by gambling) - so what? Making a political standpoint when making a film about the Cuban revolution is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why does all this Cuban speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it will be great if we find out who is - we've been 'suggested' to everyone in the beginning - a cheap way to make relationships clear in the movie! The acting was mostly level, wood and incredible, timing was everywhere. The 'special' visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and the black character as Greek choir - strictly gratuitous, intellectually exaggerated, and consistent from his place. I just watched the whole movie, because I waited for clarity, or a few pointers. It never happened.
