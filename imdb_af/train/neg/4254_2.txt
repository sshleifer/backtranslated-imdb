I can't believe the same man addressed this crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written, if it did poorly. <br /> <br /> This stack can't even claim it. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then the story ignores to describe what happened next. Following the narrative, it could somehow make a good successor, but Craven chose to go into the older movie style, with no good tie, but the biggest villain's name. <br /> <br /> Even the actor playing Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have respect for your taste in movies.
