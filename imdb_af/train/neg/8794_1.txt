I am completely amazed at why this film is even equal, let alone so much, especially by so many critics who are otherwise reasonably meaningful. <br /> <br /> There is one keyword describing film in its core - annoying. <br /> <br /> The easiest explained example of this is the director's use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music. In the first half, a very dim reggae tune is played about three times (once too often). But in the second half The Mommas and The Papas "California Dreamin" are played at least seven times, usually at the highest volume. Gods, whether you like the song or not in advance, you will be very sick by the end. Just think, some people claim that this movie was seen four or five times. This means they listened to California Dreamin 28 or 35 times. <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper-repetition (it doesn't contribute to the story) may be excused as the rest of <br /> <br /> <br /> I found Bridgette Lin's drawer all around. and still plays Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even it behaved fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie's undeservedly high reputation will convince very poor suckers to see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you've never seen a HK movie, don't start with this one. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to see it, avoid seeing it in a theater at all costs. The quick and push buttons are essential tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You're warned!
