What is most striking about this semi-musical set in the 1920s Berlin is the wonderful cinematography and editing. This is top of the line of First National in these departments. The story is gently tempting and similar to the plots of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY) where the working girl is praised by a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final sounds. All four music numbers are counted at the beginning of the movie and we go long without any further musical excitement. Miller sings parts of I think of baby and reprint because of you. THERE IS ALWAYS NEVER TURNED AND THINK YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST ONE. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very engaging and delightful, reminds me of Irene Dunne in terms of fashion and delivery. Sad not to dance as it is her forts. SALLY remains her best film, with this backlog as second and the rather poor SUNNY is a very inferior runner. Her life was tragically cut by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. It is worth visiting these movies to see Ziegfeld's top star of the twenties.
