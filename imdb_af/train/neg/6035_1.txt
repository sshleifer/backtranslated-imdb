I really wish I could give it a negative voice because I think I wasted just 83 minutes of my life and watch the worst horror movie ever put into the movie. the acting was just god terrible, i mean really bad, the dialogue was worse, the writing sounded like it was written by .... i can't think of anything terrible enough to say to me. And the day "outside" and the night "inside" shots make you think the events took over several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc. Etc. All the way to the gofer how to get lunch for everyone. Stay away from this one at all costs. Being my only saving grace to stay out of hell is doing one good thing, telling the world not to look at this shit. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
