had to see it, it looks like a great, scary premium prison that finds a magical book, oh wrong! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /> <br /> But there was no story to go with the good idea. rather than cold / physiological horror, it relied on effects in the open fire and OTT body wrestler - which was not afraid of your more than 12. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters killed for nothing but bodycount. waste of good characters - which was the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the movie doesn't really go anywhere and I believe I will say it needs a Hollywood remake. you only lose interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as other French films that have come out over the past few years, such as flowery rivers that were at least vigilant / entertaining, manfique is not about to be honest. and I'm sure you can guess the end before watching the movie. really very disappointing - impossible to recommend.
