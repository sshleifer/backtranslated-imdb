STUDIO 666 (also known as the United Kingdom) is another sub-par skate that shows the appearance of a straight-to-DVD movie. <br /> <br /> While many of the straight-to-DVD movies are fast-STUDIO 666 a sad failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, each comment on the first page contains a negative review and a negative review. . Each of these people hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> The two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a score of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously they have seen little treasure movies and even more limited understanding of the horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it performs better than THE CHOICE AND ONE OF THEM, two extremely mediocre slasfilms I wouldn't want for my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie should be done hundreds, if not thousands, times. The movie has only a slight twist (and one that is poorly handled) to the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Shortly afterwards her spirit returned to own one of her surviving friends. The said injured friend goes on a deadly spree. The rest of the plot is really bizarre. You just have to see it for yourself, as your interest hasn't diminished to the point of extinction. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie is largely poor. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. She helps elevate the film to similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly, preventing her from saving the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally poor. The villains didn't seem to be the least ominous, every murder was totally without tension or tension, the atmosphere wasn't there and the camera work was incredibly basic. Some of the special effects (if you can call them) reminded me of the TV series, GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately, GHOST STORIES have written for the producers of this movie writer, made credible performances and excellent use of camera angles. Perhaps if the producers watched the TV series carefully, they would have picked up more techniques that could save this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> The music is totally incompatible with the tone of the movie. It's just rock music and not the best examples of this type. Don't start me with the terrible song played at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie, especially the dialogue, are inadvertently funny. Unfortunately, it's not funny enough to move the movie up (or it should be off) to the bad-it-good level. <br /> <br /> Overall, STUDIO 666 is an everyday mediocre skater with very few significant aspects. I only recommend it to those who are fans of straight-to-DVD movies, and desire to see every single treasure ever made.
