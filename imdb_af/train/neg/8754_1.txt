This movie is really awful. After I saw the ad for it, I thought it might have its charm ... but it didn't. The girls can't act and they can't sing either. The soundtrack of this movie is full of their songs, and it's not a pretty sight. Terrible story line, amazing plot, it's one of Disney's worst movies by FAR!. Ally is not a bad actress on 'Phil of the Future', so I don't know what happened in Cow Belles. And her sister, AJ, just seems to be a row on her sister's celebrity, and she shows no talent like that ever. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn a clich√© of morals, but it's too late to save this train wreck movie. <br /> <br /> Awful
