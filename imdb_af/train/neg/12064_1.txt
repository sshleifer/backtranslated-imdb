It's one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's absolutely god horrible, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is horrible, plus I could see the two twists at the end that get away! The great environment and the creepy house would definitely have helped if it wasn't so boring, and there is not one character to root, and I hope it makes the way to under 100 because it deserves it in my opinion. When John Carradine finally comes up, it's a very good scene, but it's too late, and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks, and the only real scene in the movie is when a character is get face. by Bee's mess because it was a pity. I did it in a DVD Horror series called Back From The Grave and everyone really works in my opinion, plus it is fortunate that it was included in a set I bought differently, if I had snatched it out of the window! . It's one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's absolutely god horrible, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say it avoids it like the plague! You don't want to go through the torture. The direction is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson does an absolutely horrible thing! work here, make everything cheap, waste its potential to create creepy atmosphere and keep the movie on an incredibly dull fit. The Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but otherwise he is scarcely in the film other than flashback scenes. (Carradine Reguit !!). Cheerful Otherwise, horribly like Laura, because she didn't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat creepy, but also exaggerated. She did have a creepy smile. The rest of the roll, I also didn't pay enough attention because I had a lot of trouble getting through, but they were all very bad. Overall, avoid it, it's not worth it! BOMB out of 5
