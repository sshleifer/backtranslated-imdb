The first scene in 'Problem Child' has a baby facing a nun's face. For this movie it is spiritual. A nasty, temperate 'comedy', it is merciless at so many levels that it resigns. John Ritter is the friendly father who takes the child from hell and hears him maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying appearances and puerile humor. And what does Jack Warden do in this mess? Tackled by Dennis Dugan and unpleasant in his efforts to turn on the sentimentality when it comes to crudity, the film is made so bad that it is quite a bizarre experience. But don't mind. The relief of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and immeasurable child actor ever to hit the screen ?? believe me, you want to hit him right in the mouth.
