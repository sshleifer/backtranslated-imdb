This time the hero from the first movie became a man and this time fist and foot combinations against super universal soldiers and a computer that went wrong and willing to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team, who all convinced Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing viewable action movie. But that was what weakened his credibility forever. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as dull as Double Team or The Quest, it's pretty much indeed, with no style and flair of the original and no star pair. This successor is made easy for children who struggle professionally. Looking back, even the action was not so exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud. In other words, another cleaver in Van Damme's assembly line. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
