There were some funny movies about spirits coming out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). Of course, the best Topper movies were in the late 30's early 40's. And recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remake of 1941, comes here to Mr Jordan. It was well written, funny, entertaining comedies, all centered around supernatural beings such as ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell, who makes his film debut with a story of an unlikely, young young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is killed on her wedding day and then come back to harm the outstanding spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell), who falls for Kate's fianc√©, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing that is clear at first: Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two "Topper" films), which is the standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There's a line right in the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) says to Henry, "You don't smile." It described my situation throughout this film. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that the writing is just not very funny. But it is exacerbated by Longoria Parker's presence that made me swear on the screen every time. Just to start compiling her lack of comic talent, is she covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows how she really looks? Kate is killed while being set up for a wedding by a false frozen image. She is so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about her afterlife goes out on her (well, she just fades). Kate finds her as a ghost back on earth without knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to come out of the funk he obviously put down after Kate's death (of what I saw from Kate, he needed a great relief), so she admonished him Ashley, who really doesn't "I don't know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she's also a caterer to meet ends) to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There are quite a few of the waterfalls going on. <br /> <br /> The emptiness of the film is portrayed by a B story around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). It is thrown near the end, but the way Ashley handles it, she suggests she's a boob as much as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely deficient women, he deserves everything he gets. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Kate seems to be Ashley and the fun has to start. It's not, and more is sorry, because it could have been pretty funny in other hands. As is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. turning into their graves to see that is what made their shine in the first two "Topper" movies.
