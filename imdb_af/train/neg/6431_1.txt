This movie is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggeration compiled by the most shameful lunatics ever to work on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam and it's surprising that anyone associated with this production has ever had another job in the industry. The Marxist Leninists who wrote this trash did so to attack a man justified by history and fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan, unfortunately for this communist swamp, took over where McCarthy stopped and they could not stop him, thus the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never see this movie if you are looking for the truth about sen McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Treason" for a better look at the truth about Sen McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also help if you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
