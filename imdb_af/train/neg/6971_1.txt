All this terrible waste of movie stock needs is Count Floyd which pops up every sixty seconds. Somehow they found Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty on a set and couldn't get a real movie within five kilometers, about eight miles. Boy sucks this thing. There is no original line, mind, shot or effect of brainless opening sequence to the brainless. The magical, ethereal Susan Anspach of five easy pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big mistake - boring. If it's a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a documentary document. <br /> <br /> Serious - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. Usually it is in the opening credits - "Written, Directed, and Produced by" one old. Or in the middle of the action, bimbo is so talented that you know there is only one reason why this turkey is made. Here, you won't find the very last of the credits, where the co-operation of about a dozen sub-functions of the Canadian government is gratefully acknowledged. <br /> <br /> Right now I'm looking at MST's attack on Bees from Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. GOD, which is an improvement.
