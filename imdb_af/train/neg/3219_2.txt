Someone called Howard Koch a schlock master, but he wrote the Casablanca script, didn't he? Or didn't he. Perhaps there is more than one Koch in Hollywood, and anyway, I'm not too fond of Casablanca. Wait a while - yes, there is another Howard Koch hanging around Hollwyood. That's the one who wrote "Casablanca". Does not matter. I will put so much care into this comment as "Howard W. Koch" put into this production, which is just a little bit. <br /> <br /> You know how it sounds? Someone read and decided on Cliff's Notes on Shakespeare's King Lear, as there were no original thoughts on board the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and to Hollywoodise it with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Learners decide to divide his big estates between three sisters, and before they do, they ask how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and break his nose to get him to his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to work on Lear. But in the play, Lear stays alive to regret his decision to give the two crooks his stash and deprive the honest girl. He gets crazy and naked during a storm on the heath, flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Children can do it to you. (Take my child, for example. After all the effort I had to raise him, he has any interest in becoming a doctor or lawyer? No.) In the end, everyone dies in the play. <br /> <br /> In the film, the good sister is apparently mean and suicide, but if she tries to force herself, someone jumps in and saves her, so the end is more or less happy. It's the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a tragedy that's enough for him.
