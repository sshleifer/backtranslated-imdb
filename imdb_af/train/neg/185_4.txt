The five or as really good western that Mann made is unparalleled as an Hollywood ensemble. Even John Ford has never done so much with so much quality. The strange thing about them all is how uneven they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero of them except Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase was far from the river, and probably some others. But none of them is as complete as My Darling Clementine, but then there are very few films, western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of the five films by Mann has huge gaps, or is it six, we can see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and Yep, Six, Naked Spur. Each one has a beautiful scene to a beautiful scene, with pretty sharp decay. Yet it also does Red River, which is still the largest western creature. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the Far Country has large, large holes. It is mawkish, and only comes alive when Stewart and Mc Entire horns close. The rest is nice pedestrian, with the exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a one-man course in cinematography. It's about as good as anybody ever got behind a strip of moving movie. It's almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The Far Country has one wonderful moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. No one in the history of the theater has ever received physical punishment with that man's authority. He is absolutely wonderful: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man of Laramie. Bend was beaten and hung with a wire so credible and with such boiling hatred he looked like someone who had been moved from Dachau. shot from a raft with such violence, it seems so convincing that you are faltering, and of course when dragged through the fire in man, you find yourself looking for the focal points. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he is beaten early in the hotel room has also done as well as anyone ever did. <br /> <br /> But it was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any battle scene ever recorded. Cooper, while not quite as convincing as Stewart, is somehow equal to the end of the battle. In short, no one but no one but no one showed man in extremist as well as Mann. <br /> <br /> What a good, good director. <br /> <br /> See every western he ever made. They are his true monuments, even though everyone is scary. But so what. When he roars with his big scenes, they are as good as anyone, including Ford. And its six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
