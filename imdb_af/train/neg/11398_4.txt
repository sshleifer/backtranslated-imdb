I saw this movie mainly as Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I met briefly in LA at a modeling fair in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did her part very well. Being such a beautiful and chosen TV host and model, it was not surprising. I left to wonder why she was killed and what happened. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie, and though I liked the actors, I felt it was heard for a college. I tried to keep an open mind considering horror, was not my favorite genre, but felt I had gags out. It seemed to have come out in some places, letting you guess in some places what powers the evil professor had, and like many other films had an unsatisfactory end. <br /> <br /> After writing a few scripts, I know a lot of these are difficult and can derive from personal opinions, how many movies you have seen and studied, and those related to you at a certain time love. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I find it interesting, but not a satisfactory plot and end up for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would eventually return through the portal and kick everyone's ass that would be a satisfying end and earn a higher rating.
