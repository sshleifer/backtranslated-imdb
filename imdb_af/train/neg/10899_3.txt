Cheap and sensible, blurry dull story and acting. Not a good line, not even a good enough line to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the blocker role included with the DVD showed how inactive the actors were and how little fun any of them had. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetic inexplicable, and the antagonists did not become terrible or credible. The "homoerotic" earrings were tirelessly tame and unsatisfactory, and were limited to young boys decorating their coffins while fleeing in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action would have woken up to me and my girlfriend at least.
