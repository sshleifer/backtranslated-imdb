Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eva Clayton (Vaccaro) are a so-called hot item in this trip; a luxury 747 aircraft stretched out to look like a nightclub slash hotel? there is even a blind piano player who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b! $ 3 and what will do anything to get attention from Henpecked man Martin (Christopher Lee) and later the rest of the people on board. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments: Boeing 747 makes a stomach in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen gets her jaw as she goes too far, and furniture (and shouts) that becomes "ball bearings" in a zinc cup. <br /> <br /> The action and rescue sequence here is relatively phenomenal, but there is not much to do. Hitchcock had to target this successor, but I forgot why? He would have done wonders for the 1970s original, on which this successor was partially inspired ('77 also received inspiration from 'The Flight of the Phoenix'). <br /> <br /> Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite their days at `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte '(apparently they do not play hard here, just reunite? Autumn lovers). And isn't the actress the same as Emily's companion? The one who played the hammered maid said, "What happened to Baby Jane?" <br /> <br /> TV actors include the girl of Mayberry FSB in character's daughter winning a drawing competition, or something so lame, Buck Rogers' Gil Gerard and 'Dynasty's' Pamela Bellwood. <br /> <br />
