When I finally had the opportunity to see Zombie 3 (Zombie Bottle Theaters 2 in Europe) on a Japanese entry region 2, I was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is. The transfer is just about impeccable, as good as it has ever been, unless Anchor Bay gets it. The gore really looks as it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx. The sound is great too. It's just 2 channels dolby, but if you have a Dolby Prologic 2 receiver, you can really appreciate the cheesy music (actually a very good score), and the effective but inexpensive sound effects. It never sounded so good, and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood is flowing in this movie, it's extremely brutal with explosive shots, explosive puss-filled megaposies, a gland to a zombie throat, a woman's limbs burned ( how did it not burn the man)), bowel movements, zombie babies and so much more i lost track. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly for hardcore zombie action fans, especially of the Italian type. There are some excellent pieces and cinematography found. I think people don't give it enough credit, if you see a clean print and not a terrible pirate copy, it's a whole different experience altogether. <br /> <br /> This movie never leaves for a second, and I realize it's contradictory plotwise, the dubbing is awful, The acting is stiff, and it's a sense of unreasonability that is in great fashion celebrated, but it is part of its charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies ever made, you can't make a movie this bad, as well, on purpose. It is accidental genius of the highest order. If they played it, it would have been a disaster, but they played it straight like an arrow and the result is a tremendous cult classic that thumbs it up at any and all traditional movement standards. <br /> <br /> Tone action ranges, exotic locations, excellent set design, good, sometimes gre on cinematography, wonderful cheesy acting and inconsistent but still interesting plot, great makeup effects, beautiful build women, excellent music and sometimes hilarious, sometimes creepy, but always entertaining zombies. How can you go wrong with this movie, it has it all, a cult classic that is the test of time.
