You don't have to write a script for this devastated indignation! You just sit back and watch some male women and guests exchange each other for an uneasy audience exposure at The Jerry Show! Violent and unpleasant, this entry to the actual Jerry Springer program reveals everything the show-off hip-talk show does not show you on the air - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos from "Cops" manufacturers. Even the outside world of Springerland unveils the most amateur play of the decade! It shows you that the GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a movie turkey. Change the channel! REJECT <br /> <br />
