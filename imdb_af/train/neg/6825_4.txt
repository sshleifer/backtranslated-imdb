Once a big action star who has fallen off the ground ends in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Reunite with some former co-stars to clean the town. <br /> <br /> Low key, often to the point of gentleness, "action" comedy works mostly only. Part of the problem is Chris Klien as a former action hero. He's not bad, but he's really not credible, because someone was taken as a difficult man. As I said he was not bad, he was just mistaken for what his back story was. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which is actually not funny and sometimes looks artificial, and the direction pedestrian is in the gate of dull. There is no life in the way things are set up. It's as if the director had a list of shots and went to that list. It makes for an unimportant movie. And yet the movie sometimes jumps, as in the final show that ends the movie. The sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie thrive, it drains much of its power. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend the movie. It's worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or a huge fan of independent theater in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
