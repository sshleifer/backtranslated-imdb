Wow, here it is; the action "movie" without action. In a real low-budget environment (don't fly the hilarious flying saucers flying a few times) from a future Seattle, we find a hard-hearted crusher without trying to avenge her childhood. <br /> <br /> There's nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performances are only stunned by the efforts to steal from other movies, especially Matrix, without having the money to Do it right. Yes, we see a twist on the walls and slow movements (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts to make jokes about male incompetence from time to time. <br /> And yes, we've also had a number of leads that don't lead anywhere, as though the screenplay was played by the previously invisible role while the screens were shot. <br /> <br /> Believe me it's as bad as it can get. In fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can't rent some of you and save you money.
