What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I suggest it was this horrible little film earlier this year. Written, poorly edited, and (if I can be so brave), the "Order" is the black hole of the movie - a movie so dense, not even the slightest entertainment can escape from its suicide event horizon. It's not even accidentally funny like (for example) "Showgirls." <br /> <br /> You know the producers accept that their audience won't be very clever. They named the film, originally titled "The Sin Eaters", because they thought Americans were too stupid to understand what a sinner had eaten, even though it is very good to explain what a sin eats in the movie. Instead, they are a completely generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger, looking out, is more than enough to get you there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what do you know, it was right! My ex-girlfriend saw the photo of Heath and threw me in. Congratulations, producers, you met your target market. She also held "Grease II", so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific (you guess) command that is trying to kill his mentor. He has celibacy issues, possibly because no one in their right mind would believe he knows the slightest thing about religion, much less a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat man. As much as I wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic on the big screen, his efforts to remind me of all the dorks in my high school that made Monty Python's imitations, and think that if they just say the lines The Pythons did that they would be automatically funny. You know the kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I speak even more, I will have the danger of generating spoilers. Frankly, the thing this movie was spoiled for me was the fact that it was created.
