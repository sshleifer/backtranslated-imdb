This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I've never seen anything worse. Keep the trophy down and give it to these people ..... there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Three more days after I watched it (for some reason I still don't know why) I can't believe how crazy this movie is / was. It's so bad. So far from anything that can be considered a movie, a story or something that has ever been created and brought into existence. <br /> <br /> It asked me if people really are put on this earth doing well. It made me feel about ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of film hurts us sincerely as a society. We must be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living and creating here is that we should prevent the creation of this desperate confusion of our reality. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, authors or the director of the movie sleep at night to know they play a role in making "Loaded". I don't know what kind of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies. <br /> <br /> It's said, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIE. I tell all my friends to see them because they are bad. <br /> <br /> But this ....... crosses the line of "bad" into a whole new dimension. It is uncomfortably bad. These are the bad ones where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every order before they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean as after looking the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every cheese editing effect becomes indifferent over and over to a disease point. I really never want to see the "shaky" camera's drug buzz rush effect or cut or cut or cut any cut. It is meticulously sowing, repetitive and torturing the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most astonishing thing about this movie is what made the production that a little decent amount of money was actually put into this apart. Personally, I will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him see and shake him in the presentation, demanding that he go home and swallow two liters of Drain-O or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhuman torture for our war prisoners overseas, they just hold this movie back in a stuffed cell over and over. Trust me, I think they will be more outrageous with suicide methods after the 72nd time of this session. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are just the most beautiful of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
