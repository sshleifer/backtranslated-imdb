The final movie for Ernst Lubitsch, which was completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a lively act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume drama. In a 19th-century castle in Southeastern Europe, a countess falls to her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian uprising; She is helped by her ancestor, whose painted image comes to life magically. Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig decorated with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is overwhelmed with different ideas - or entertainment. The results are beautiful but not absorbent. * 1/2 of ****
