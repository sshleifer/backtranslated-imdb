This movie can't even be said to be bad, because it's a pity, just painfully mediocre. If there is no real whiteness or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the "jokes" (which is predictable and thinnable) are so bored that the boredom and gift quickly catch up with the viewer. Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that we 'shocked' or amused 30 years ago does not work in the same way. We've seen it before, and it doesn't break taboo anymore, because they've been evaporating long ago. A big mistake.
