After looking at a dozen episodes, I decided to give up on this show as it depicts an unrealistic way of mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals with mathematical models, I thought my profession was joking. I'm not a mathematician, rather a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to you why it is shown is close to the "make-believe" of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even he will have to spend a lot of time on a suitable model, specifically to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are erratic and random, there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there was a model for a particular type of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoichastic) one, which means it has a good chance of making a wrong prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, finding the right model for someone or a situation, the model parameters should be known. These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as the gravity acceleration (9.8 m / s2), and it is often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes will have to be someone other than genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And after selecting the model and parameters, they must be tested. Strange, they are not and with miracle they exactly fit the situation being predicted. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by numbers but also by Sci movies: the computational effort needed to solve these models. Try to do Excel to solve a complex model with many comparisons and variables and find one to do a Herculean job. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to fix his models, he can stand firmly with hardware that will be extremely slow. And even with the right software / hardware combination, the model solution may take days to reach. He's releasing them right away! I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it's far from the best performance. The characters are somewhat more stereotypical, but not very funny, like those in Big Bang Theory. The crimes are boring and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes makes the FBI look rather incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some laymen the show can work. For others, how things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!
