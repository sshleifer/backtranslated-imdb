I bought this movie from Gamestop's discount used, and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99 cents. The movie itself has slowed down and they use almost ten different monkeys throughout the entire movie. Not to mention, they use a stunt double that is just a short man in costume who made a desperate attempt to personalize a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director has more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimps after the film debuted. In a preview for another low-rent Warner Bros. movie and finally owed money to the studio. It also doesn't help that he wasn't even notorious for the terrible work he did. He wasn't even known for making a poop-chute movie. Why was this movie ever made?
