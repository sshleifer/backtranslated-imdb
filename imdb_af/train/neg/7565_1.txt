This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars I have spent in a very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies, you would probably say it's hard to think, but never-the-less, that's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and tension, why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing short of intriguing and exciting; Unfortunately, the movie is not one of these. <br /> <br /> From cinematography, script, acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you read it, plan on going to the movie, expecting a little excitement, mystery, action, horror or anything other than an hour and forty-five minutes, I'm afraid you're disappointed. <Br /> <br /> "Why is it so bad," you can ask yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was not mysterious or exciting. Nothing about the movie made me the least "on the edge," scared or curious. The writing was at its best. There were many times throughout the film where the dialogue was just as ridiculous, I just wrote it off as a strip relief to find out just a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but it was a mistake. Without exception, each performance in this movie was incredibly lower than the average. The cinematography was terrible with no moment of tension or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away. <br /> <br /> I'm usually not a very hard critic. Frankly, if I was going to see a comedy, I wanted to laugh and when I went to see a mystery / tension / horror, I just wanted to be surprised. This movie was boring, poorly performed, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
