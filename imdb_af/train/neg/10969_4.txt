Maybe I'm outdated or just don't know what Electra is like in current publications. But the Electra I read was much more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work and was more often than not a kind of double cross. Just when you think you've figured out everything, pull the wool over your eyes and get her way. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty poor on the dialogue, the acting wasn't very convincing and the action was miserable. I was really looking for something more in line with Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin." What is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect where cool, action was sometimes interesting, but more often than not, was the story and plot slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not threatened enough, and Electra was not ..... thick enough. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story I just didn't care.
