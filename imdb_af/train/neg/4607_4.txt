You can't think of looking at King of the Ants. As a massive Gordon fan, I expected the European premiere with an evil anticipation. Especially because I love Dagon - Gordon's last performance - so much. King of the ants performed here in my country and it was Gordon himself who came to present it. Unfortunately, I can't congratulate him after that. King of ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. Really, the quality level never exceeded ordinary TV thriller standards. The plot sketch is extremely routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical Gordon touch is never recognized. In addition, the already poor font has more holes than a Swiss bowl of cheese! It involves a young wannabe rogue who is hired to commit murder. So he does. And of course they don't pay him. And of course he falls in love with the victim's wife. And of course he deprives himself. Only the rows in which the man comes in a spiral of madness are worth mentioning and they are the only ones to remind you of the fact that you are still watching a Stuart Gordon movie. The appearances are below average with McCenna as the heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as the chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the kind-hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things are constantly happening and the boredom of the story is very annoying, while the makeup effects are not enough to satisfy even amateur horror fans. I read some other comments about King of the Ants and claim that it is Gordon's best since it is ultimately an exciting and mature movie. Well, if that's the case. I'd rather be immature and give Re-Animator another view, thank you. much. Oh yeah, I think every good director eventually runs out of steam and inspiration. It's bad that it also conquers Stuart Gordon.
