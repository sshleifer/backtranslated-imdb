I think Micheal Ironsides acting career must be over, if he has to die in this kind of low crap. Surely he can do better than waste his time in this garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie can be much better if it has a good budget, but it repeatedly shows through the movie. There is one scene at an outpost, which seems to be outside the front of a train station, and I know it is. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that made this movie a 3, and it shows the spacecraft coming over and over a lake surrounded by forests. It's done well, but the rest of the movie, forget about it. <br /> <br /> There's another scene that looks like an engineering plant, which I bet, and doesn't look like a space outpost as the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a serious low budget, doesn't make sense and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
