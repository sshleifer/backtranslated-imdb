Good. Where to start. Let's just say it; Avoid this movie <br /> <br />. It's based on a cartoon. The movie makes the cartoon like Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Filled with emotional actors who feel ashamed to be here <br /> <br />, lousy camera work, terrible music and enough product placement to make <br /> <br /> you never Yahoo! do not visit! Again, this movie is really the <br /> <br /> bottom of the loop. To name the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br />, Rupert Everett snatches their way through this photo with the gay abandonment <br /> <br /> of men who are a rare kind of payroll in the far away. . <br /> <br /> They have to pay us the millions they deserve to watch it. <br /> <br /> Awful.
