If you look at the true story of early baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - but if you look at a reasonably crafted art theme ripper, you've found your movie. <br /> <br /> This film is such a fundamental inaccurate depiction of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that almost made me cry. (Type Artemisia inaccuracies in Google and look at some of the fact versus fiction articles.) However, from a purely technical point of view, the movie was good: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped make an impressive early 17th century experience; although the above-mentioned HAPPY FACTUAL INACCURACIES drop it a little. <br /> <br /> I wonder how director / co-author Agn√®s Merlet defended her film at the time? Perhaps she refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate because we saw it, she was.
