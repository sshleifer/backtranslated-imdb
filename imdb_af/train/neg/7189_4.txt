What a total disappointment! The 6.1 score here at IMDb has built up some expectations, but I was disappointed. The first thing that attacks me is that brainstorming, stereotyped college children. Yes, I know teens can be childish and so on, but why are they always portrayed as complete braindadmorones? There was one character I thought was good, but he / she (not being revealed here) was killed before the end. The other characters were poorly executed and even the alleged hero / heroine just didn't do it to me. On the plus side: The plot is pretty good and the productions appreciate a cut above for these kind of flicks. The acting was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer was in a small role. But it all fails with mere and brave characters. You just stop at 10 minutes after they care. 4/10 (and that's pleasing).
