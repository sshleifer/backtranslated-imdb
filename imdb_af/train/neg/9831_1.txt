I tried to watch this movie without really being able to sit there because it is supposed to have a "good" message; The problem is that it is apparently produced according to one specific interpretation of Scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead many people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the play in this movie was totally unacceptable. I never wanted a negative score to judge a movie. So, if you constantly want to be preached by those without authority, then you should get the movie. This comment is also a warning to people who love or love scifi because the title will also mislead many people. It was an unfortunate movie because the basic idea had possibilities and the possibilities were wasted. The only redeemable quality of the film is that it made me realize that the character in the "Time Machine" probably had a little more moral indignation on the strange behavior of those in his future.
