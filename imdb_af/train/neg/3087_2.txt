A group of highly unlikely A-holes are bothered by lame dolls that have been popular in some movies for 20 years with some older boots. <br /> <br /> Many people know this movie. only from MST3K's spot of the movie. But I saw the real movie and can safely say that yes it is bad, really, VERY bad. From one of the most horrific "fencing" I have ever seen, I suffered from the stuffed toy "aliens", who suffer from a lack of movement (I had a My pet monster that was scarce) to the horrific play (I had a My pet sample that was more charismatic). However, it is said that Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" films are somehow and trust me I have no earthly idea how, much worse. It's not to suggest that this movie is nothing but crap, because it's not. Just throw it out there. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: no nudity in the movie, but there are 2 pairs of tits in the DVD.
