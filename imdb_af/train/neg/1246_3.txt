Spoilers I think. <br /> <br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the end ruins the whole movie. I just couldn't get over it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly found myself landing on a planet full of talking monkeys, I'd all be like this: "AAAAhhhhHHH! Walk for your life! The monkeys inherited the Earth!" But he's all like, "monkeys, okay. Next?" It's nice, I'll say. He has to run regularly in equally strange things. In addition, it is Rick Baker's best work. This film is a true proof of how far we've come in the monkey makeup field. 10/03.
