The bad news is it's still very scary. I gave it a 2 because some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually looks funny. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and progress needs to be rewarded. Or maybe I drank heavily when I watched it and felt generous. Whatever, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's pretty fast. It captures elements of most of the key themes of Kill Bill I & II and fights scenes, hooks them up, hides them, falls into the dialogue, and squeezes the whole mess into about an hour of really horrible amateur video. <br /> <br /> You'll want to smoke something very powerful if you want to enjoy this one. And get this DVD back in time to the video store! You will really hate you if you have to pay a late fee.
