Someone had a good idea: let's have Misty Mundae do her own, R-rated version of Lara Croft - shooting two guns, not just in skimpy outfits, but also topless. It was indeed a good idea. The problem is that the people who had it couldn't come up with any kind of script or budget to support it. That's why we get a "movie" that barely reaches medium length by playing many of its parts (often in slow motion) and is apparently shot in a garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still clear: she is incredibly cute and has a natural girl-by-door beauty. But her two female co-stars here, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are nowhere near her league. If "Mummy Raider" is offered as a Youtube video, I will upgrade it higher, but if a "movie" for DVD use is concerned, it will not get more than 1/2 a * out of 4.
