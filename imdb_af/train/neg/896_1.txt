This movie is terrible. Not offensive, but extremely predictable. The movie follows the life of a small town in the mid 60's. The father, the school principal, goes through a half-life crisis. Give a great teacher of the big city, starting with the challenge of her students' thoughts, like thinking for yourself. The principal does not agree with her, but she is beautiful. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder Wannabe Tara Frederick) is full of the small town's lifestyle and wants to live. She gets bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning is not offered at her school. Shocking! Since that director, Paul Shapiro worked mainly on TV, this movie plays like a more mature version of a post-school special or a very special episode of one of the more oral sitcoms.
