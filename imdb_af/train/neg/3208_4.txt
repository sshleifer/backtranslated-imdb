This movie was a great disappointment to me. I waited for this movie to come out for years, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until they got bankrupt. Not only did they cut out half of the story line, but they changed information. The statement that Lucifer Hope's Father is is false. He made her father corrupt, but he himself is not her father. The voices also didn't fit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind could never be returned. I can't even remember everything about this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death, don't look at this movie. It just didn't do the comic justice !!
