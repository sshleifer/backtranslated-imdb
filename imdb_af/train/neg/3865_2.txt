It's so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can say they are really trying to polish a maze, but we all know you can't. The writing is so obvious and fit, it is sad to see if they are trying to sell it. The humor and the pacing are so difficult, it's hard to believe any of these good actors are signed for it. <br /> <br /> It is said, it's so terrible that we are hard to look away from the screen. We just need to know where this train wreck goes. But that's just because we caught it on TV. If we actually paid for it, we would be disgusting. <br /> <br /> So it gets 2 stars to be at least amusing / fascinating bad. And the accidental music (unlike the try-to-hard-indie soundtrack) is reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not so good.
