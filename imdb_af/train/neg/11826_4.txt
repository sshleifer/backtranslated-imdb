There is something sad to see someone so good at doing something, doing something different ... and eventually being mediocre. I thought of Jordan playing baseball, but that also applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie has been fairly well behaved and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a good job of adapting a classic story to a comedy in Roxanne, but this attempt to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene is stroking straight into a wall of independence. If you want to see an old story that has been updated with some styles, you can buy the best expectations.
