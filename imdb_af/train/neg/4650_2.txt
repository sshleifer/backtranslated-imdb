With a film of stalwart British character actors and pleasing photography of the 1950s Britain, I was hoping and expecting to be more entertained by this movie. Unfortunately, for the wrong reasons I glued myself to it. I couldn't really believe how terrible it was. I had to watch thousands of old movies and am always ready to make allowances for their products of their time, but it was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, a big problem is that it doesn't seem like it is: a soft romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into song for about 15 minutes! It's not credible at any level, either the storyline itself or the fact that Daisy never has an ounce of threat at any time. Other aspects that deny credibility include the decisive Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for the sake of God!), The fact that he has Diana Dors for a fianc√© and doesn't have the least interest in her (I mean, Princess Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in a song publisher's office. The whole thing is foolish in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> If I had to pick a favorite scene, it would be one at the start with that great actor Wilfred Lawson - after all, it has a great deal.
