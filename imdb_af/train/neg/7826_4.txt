Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Awful. No plot. No depth. No meaning. This film made Superman a meaningless hero, a hero without archetype. In the original film he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represents nothing but a Hulk. <br /> <br /> Sure, the actors were good. Kevin Spacey was a good choice. <br /> <br /> It still doesn't solve the problem that this movie had no depth. I can't see anyone coming out of this movie, when Superman was and was created daily to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds. This was a valid waste of money, taking into account the directions of this film. <br /> <br /> Just a few cases: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and over and over. and so on. He was just another goofball Hackman incarnation. <br /> <br /> A Superman? What does he stand for in this movie? Nothing but another "savior" figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you don't see it at all.
