Sometimes something strange and contemporary does not always benefit everyone. While I would admit that the set design and concept of the film was quite interesting, implementing these ideas in one congruent story just didn't work. This film was so scary and useless, not even Robin Williams could save this garbage. Clearly, Barry Levinson's dream fell flat on his face, but he had warned the rest of the world about this demolition.
