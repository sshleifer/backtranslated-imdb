The other night I saw the movie. I can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked. The writing, the voice work, even the clay. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching C-Team 24 hours for the sake of comedy. It just doesn't work. It literally falls flat on every possible place. <br /> <br /> The animation of the movie is also very poor. I know this is a movie made by one person, but to think that he can make 97 minutes of trouble, maybe he can make at least 1 second of funny. <br /> <br /> This show can be the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It was really so bad. If you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, you hide from this horror. My advice: Don't even buy it or look it up. Your brain will be like you.
