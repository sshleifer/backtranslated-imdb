Everything about this movie was terrible. To begin with, this movie has a pretty good role and I find it impossible to make such a big part in the biggest disaster for the gangster movie genre ever. The soundtrack was like one of a very bad blow-stick comedy. It had this music throughout the film, and it started to get annoying.
