I gave this movie only 2 stars because Dominic Monaghan is actually struggling in his acting. Everything about this movie is very amateur. Everything related to the direction of this film was performed very poorly. Not only does the director have to reconsider what she's doing for a life career, but maybe she should watch some movies. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, let him put himself in a movie of this caliber. Whoever was the "actor" who played Jack's best friend never had to walk in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small movie, but maybe a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their environment. Don't waste your time or money on this movie (as I did), you'll be very disappointed.
