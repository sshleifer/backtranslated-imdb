The acting in the movie is really well done honestly, but the film is so slow and so boring, once it gets interesting, everything slows down to a great end. I'm happy to see Sam Rockwell in it, he did a good job, so did the other actors like me, but man ... it's one of the worst dragged movies I've ever seen. Now maybe in a short movie format, this movie will be good, but unlike that, avoid it. This movie has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never ever go to movies, but I watched this one at home with family. I went out. Yes, it was boring. Apparently my comments don't have enough lines to post, so here's a little more stuffing. I think I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
