OK, I like bad horror. I especially love horror enough to have fun. Demonicus of House of the Dead - it was bad enough to have fun. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat all through the movie and I have a number of comments, both in the "this sucks" style and in the context of real criticism. <br /> <br /> Plot (kind of) - There is a man in this city (who is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who runs around and cuts off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going to get exact numbers - thank you), maybe two or three years. One cup per week. And the police are just asking a "specialist" (who once refers to himself as a psychic, but it never comes back). <br /> <br /> Schya right! Feds take over, what, THREE connected manslaughter? After NEARLY A DUNDRED LIKE KILLINGS, we will be under freaking martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this "specialist" consults the voodoo chick who ignored the police all the time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit. who cut down heads to get enough power to make themselves a body (and presumably take over the world - or maybe just to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> About. <br /> <br /> Setting - where does this happen? Well, if you do not come from Seattle, you may not realize that there is a poster for a local radio station at the bar / rave (about ten film staff and their relatives). in the highest Pulp Fiction dialogue (as IF) between the two police officers (yes, those who get their heads cut off 15 minutes in the flip), discussing them "the new stadium" which could be another problem if this movie is made. <br /> <br /> If you are from Seattle, I apologize for the film and shame my head. <br /> <br /> OK, here it really gets critical - it's a horror movie writer (not published, won't search my name in the IMDb), I'm doing research. Lots of research. And unlike the authors of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who preserves the cemeteries and traditionally associated with a number of Christian oppressors with "Satan" - is actually a "Loki" - like trickster is god. <br /> <br /> In other words, he doesn't cut off heads. <br /> <br /> Besides, much of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies focus on owning several members of the congregation through the loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, if he already owns someone, why make a NEW body? <br /> <br /> Also, if Baron Samedi got a body, he won't go shopping, he'll get good rum and cigars and par-TAY !!! <br /> <br /> In summary, the only thing they've done (surprisingly) right is in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "creepy"). They didn't screw the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I did research. (Anyone remembers the old night shadow ad for submission of tarot readings - "The lovers - you'll fall in love soon ..." and all the nonsense). <br /> <br /> If you made it Especially by my comments, I wish you luck. And I'm sorry again. I will be sorry if you feel the need to watch the movie from me, please do not.
