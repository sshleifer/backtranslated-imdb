It's not art, it's urban, politically-correct propaganda! Jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable ... it does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most patronizing offensive Australian movie I can ever remember (and it's a bit stiff competition!). A message movie, every tired theme lover of the trendy left is there: Aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholic; White women are not that bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are probably of a depressing nature. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing find the body of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, of course) and leave her for a few days in the river as they cover trout. It's a strange decision made with almost no discussion, as if the men are animals. The one man who is spoiled for short is the good thing. We know this because he lives with a bisexual woman. He likes to keep his baby very much. He eventually moves to a more fashionable residence (away from all these beastly forest dwellers). <br /> <br /> It is a film made by the trendy city dwellers who live in fear of the Australian landscape and the evil rednecks living inside. This is ignorance of the country life is almost as shocking as its contempt. The film is shot by long-distance views of the forest, supported by pre-warring, mysterious music. By the end, it has been made clear that Aboriginal people are the only home in this landscape. It concludes with an indifferent scene of black-and-white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, rural life becomes little more than a backdrop for a story that implicitly proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of enlightened left-wing urban areas. residents over those of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This movie was not made by people with real work but funded by the Government's Film Finance Corporation. It is a product of the artsy set, populated by void void by the beautiful people for whom exaggerated state funding keeps these patronizing offensive projects (which are so detached from real life as possible), instead of actually popular films. what people want to see. It doesn't matter if the movie is a stinker, they are still being paid. <br /> <br /> Save yourself time wasting, avoid it like the plague. More bad social comments than real entertainment, this movie deserves to pan!
