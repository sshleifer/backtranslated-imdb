... not to stay in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A River Runs Through It" is definitely a well-made movie from a kineist standpoint. Great landscapes, Redford good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story). <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is like dry, wise a character as his father, a preacher. If he is driven and does not manage his own life, he is left to see his brother, who was also chased in the village and lost his life. The writer never comes close to his brother's motivation, but at least realizes that he lacks the least amount of gay / pleasure. All there is is fly fishing, where he even follows his father's style like an old man. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it is in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Definitely NOT a must-see (3/10) <br /> <br />
