It was more than 80 minutes of semi-unexpected boredom. First, I wondered how it is possible to produce such a thing. When I reached 70th minute, I convinced myself that it was only a few minutes and I lasted to the end I am so proud of the fact that I am considering watching this movie as a good test for the patience and folly of man. Was it worth looking at? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it, and if you want to be strong enough, you may even end up ... The movie doesn't have coherence and characters have no sense for everyone. All events in the movie, you can be sure you've seen somewhere before, and they seem to be placed in this movie just to fill the movie.
