It was a very bad movie. The character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the main reason why it went. The actor felt that an incredibly awkward southern draw made the character more angry, it didn't. After about 20 minutes, I wanted a speech therapist to appear. It would have been a measure of sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) poorly-acted - 2) unpathetic characters - 3) razor thin plotline <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
