Words cannot begin to describe how terribly terrible this movie is. I wish it was "so bad it is," but it is not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad I can't even laugh about it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person who is less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who, as a true declaration of vanity, leads himself as the male head. They both look like bread, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The gal, Sherry Thurig, is a viewer. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy and can act. Although you can say she's holding back. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to hold back, especially the supporting man, Mark. I saw less wood in a rain forest, but he is still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep acting actors? Is he really so bad a director? Everyone else summed up the story perfectly - there is none. Children are kidnapped and Kelly steps to resolve the crime. I knew how he felt like stepping into the paw. That's how I felt after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental shop. This is a home movie that is best viewed by the directors of the director, and if you look them up, you will see that the same friends are the one who gave the movie positive points.
