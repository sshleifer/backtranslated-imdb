I gave this movie a 1 (Awful) score. The only reason why it should even get a 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always seems no matter what terrible material his way is thrown. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so out of element here as a viewer one simply cannot come to the fact that she is even in such a piece. <br /> <br /> Dumb, stupid story and horrible production. Don't waste your video rental $.
