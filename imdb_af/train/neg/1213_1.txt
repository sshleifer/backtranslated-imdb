I can't believe people like Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved with this piece of garbage! The writing is so poorly written and directed so poorly (both by the same person) that it is difficult to find more one-dimensional characters in a movie. The dialogues are so paralyzed that this so-called thriller laughed at the few fools who came to the theater. The set-up is difficult and invites you to believe that you are going to watch a cold thriller and suddenly it appears from the most stupid persecution movie. Bassinger's character is so stupid that she actually ceases to scream at God "Where are you!" so that people can follow her and then take a lick !! And then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she's walking all over the place and the murderers never get rid of her and it happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder, is it really that the best writers in Hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it.
