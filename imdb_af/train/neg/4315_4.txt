Seriously, the only good thing about this year's ceremony was the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was pretty short, it was rather boring. I think it's serious time to look for a new director and producer for the show, which can really get something new. It is quite obvious that they have tried to make the show more 'hip' this year and offer a younger audience by making Beyonce perform and show that P. Diddy and Prince are offering a category. Being Chris the presenter was an attempt to re-create the ceremony and make it more attractive. None of it really worked out. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Chris Rock is a funny guy, but he wasn't really a good presenter. I just saw him as a man who spoke only occasionally between the different categories. His presence was not as big as Billy Crystal's. <br /> <br /> The awarding of the awards was sometimes dumb. Not to get everyone on stage, but also to give the awards in the middle of the theater was simply strange. <br /> <br /> However, I can't remember being more satisfied with the prize winners. None of the movies really swept the awards, as the last few years have always been the case. So this meant that it was a good year for movies with very competitive competitors? I do not think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years, with the exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ". Certainly I disagree with every award this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel had to have won best filmmaking, not that I didn't like Robert Richardson's work, he did really fantastic work for most Oliver Stone 's work but I really feel that Deschanel has earned the award more. I would also like to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for the best editing and John Debney for the best music. But oh yes, there is no way the Academy accepts all of course, I understand. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also funny to see that most presenters were much more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince say that one of the nominated names is right at the same time? And where is Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed". Irons were the best presenters of the night. <br /> <br /> Overall a very forgotten show but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
