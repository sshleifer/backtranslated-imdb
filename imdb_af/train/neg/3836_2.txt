Since one of the few commentators didn't see the 1st movie, I found it to be a very disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has a funny awkward kind of humor if you are the (highly) morally dubious premise. However, it is abysmal in the important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and unmatched plot line that includes Gordon Sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be entangled in a conspiracy to provide dangerous electronics to third world countries. in free computers ... or possibly not. Vague, long-lasting and unconvincing. The lack of any essential end is so disturbing and present is pumpkin and totally illogical. The movie is half finished. <br /> <br /> Suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when a very attractive female teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) is testified on Gordon Sinclair's impressive character, especially if he tolerates her advances. Laughable. It later worsens in the film when it reaches its romantic ambitions, and throws it all away for ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many movies make me feel, but I felt my time stolen.
