A friend of mine bought it (very cheaply) and decided to give it to me as a birthday. I thought I would never see it because I knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD looked pathetic, but then my friends and I were very bored and watched. from start to finish! I know quite a performance, but it's actually a masterpiece. It's hard to describe. You have to see it, it's a real lesson about what people are capable of believing they are creative and smart and really not. The "acting" is brothel (you can actually laugh at the "leading lady", she is definitely the worst). the "story" is stupid to be summed up and really sucks everything in this movie. Please pay special attention to "the sheriff". The guy is an adult and therefore it is absolutely no excuse to get involved. He is also very bad. Whatever did, have a few hilarious moments. check it out, haha
