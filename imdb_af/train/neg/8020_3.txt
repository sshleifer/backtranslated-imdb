has some beautiful poetic pieces, but is actually just an artificial throw with no direction or resolution. how do these people get through the film school? Who gives them money to make this crap? could have been so much more, fine main actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, the all-rock metaphor that just stares without finding anything compelling is just as tired and it probably doesn't do well. films. The director has to leave and live life for a good long time and not return to the camera until they really have something to say. It's like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-mural of artworks, just a bunch of serious images and hopes of hope as poetry emerges. It can work if the director actually has any vision, or has a brain that knows when in the presence of potential, but here it is just space-filler, without any consequence. I got the lazy ending moments before it hit and yelled at the screen "lazy bastard" when the credits surfaced.
