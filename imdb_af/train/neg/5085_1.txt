this movie starts with an ordinary funeral ... and it is so hard to feel this ordinary funeral that I have lost interest within 5 minutes of watching, and start kicking screens. It seems to me who made the film to the extent that it is trapped in a permanent morbid trance, and can consider nothing but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark kids of Southpark, I want to get a movie that gets me an interesting story within 10 minutes, I won't be sitting for 10 minutes, but preparing for a funeral. my grandmother In her last years she was fascinated by the funeral, perhaps she might have enjoyed this "movie".
