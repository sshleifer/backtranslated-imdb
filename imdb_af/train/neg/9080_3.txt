Well, I just ordered it from my house by view because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit that I have visited several times, but I do not even remember which parts they were. I don't understand why this movie was made. It claims it's a comedy, but seriously, I don't find a singing penis or naked 70-year-old woman very funny. This movie tried to fit into the "brutal" comedies of recent years like American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed. It was far too much, but it was comedy. Also, why did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie?!?! The only thing I like about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and pleasant and well done. Besides that, avoid this movie. 10/03
