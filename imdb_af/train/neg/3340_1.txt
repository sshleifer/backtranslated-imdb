It's the kind of movie that wants to be good, but sucks. First thing, what hell is that punk trying to do with the school? I think the kids don't realize the gravity of the situation. Poet old tells the girl that she is under his responsibility when she asks why he wants to go back to them, but immediately he gives a gun to the driver and wants him to go alone to repair the telephone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors have to pay their food, but why not just give the money needed to make such a silly movie or give the money to a charity. Oh, and none of them know how to strive. The stupid punk man doesn't shoot like a fool in the cafeteria. They all want to look professional, but they all suck. Another thing I do not believe is that there is no emergency exit in the school, try the children to try several doors, but they are all locked up. What happens if there is a fire and the dumass security guard is dead? It is illegal not to have an emergency exit at school. Anyway, there is much more to say, but it will be too long. I spent a little time of my life watching a crap.
