Stereotypical loading of bracts falls very short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact, the entire cast is totally wasted. Lame jokes are abundant, and each punch line is well telegraphed. The stupid one liners come at a quick pace, and almost everyone falls flat like a grape. The music numbers only contribute to the boredom that occurs throughout the film. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting completely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid it and look for one of "Lampoon's" really funny movies like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - NOTE
