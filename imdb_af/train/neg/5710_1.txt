Well, it looks good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer work together again, this time on a mix of heist movie, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, it's for Indiana Jones that Speed ​​2 is speeding. A reasonable role play (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights a puerile script and loses bad. The movie is not much more than an elaborate advertisement for Masons. But these Masons are not your ordinary shopkeepers who use funny handshake and play golf. These Masons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one calls 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.) I don't think I've made a plot spoil because there's no one. There is virtually no voltage, no surprises and no climax - it just stops. National Treasure target for Dan Brown, but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo's sense of humor.
