There are so many goofy things about this movie that I can only name a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART's character: 1. His name ?? Slinger McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it immediately. Son, it makes 'Humphrey' good.) 2. Its long curly hair and dull sideburns. 3. Get up his Black Bart, complete with tracks! 4. Not sure which shade lip gloss they are wearing, but it is not too flattering. <br /> <br /> CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick doesn't favor him, either. 2. The man is swallowed by his hat throughout the film! Couldn't they get a hat to suit him? Even a small one? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight in the back. 4. He blows the smoke out of his gun one too many times, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. <br /> <br /> If you are a coincidental Bogart or Cagney fan, and figure it can change a pace to see them in the west, do yourself a favor and forget the thought. Even the horses look apart! (That's when they don't get bored.) <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I admit that Westerns is my favorite movie genre, but I've seen much better than that. <br /> At a comedy level, or like a high camp, the Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it's the viewer. Therefore, see it only if a) you see every western out there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completed c) any of the above remarks call on you. Woah ?? ..
