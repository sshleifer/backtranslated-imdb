The performances of Fishbourne (which somehow seem strange) and (short appearance) Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery's who does not feel meaningful and eventually comes in the motor behavior of an 80-year-old parent. In fact, the script doesn't make sense; Suggest 60 minutes. happy ending plot plus a sudden turn attachment without any argumental structure to the characters. This is more of a crash than a roadmap and could be good for exam purposes at screen-wrights schools. The more you remember the details, the stronger this impression gets. The death penalty is not a problem here, although it is a subject from the beginning; it disappears without further comment. The subject and environment could have been good.
