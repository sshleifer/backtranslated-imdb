Unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher tendency. Pretty Young Girls In Peril. I have to give it to the movie maker who used a helicopter for some of the early roadshots. You actually think for a moment that there will be quality in production. To see "Unhinged" was like seeing an amateur acting class go through the warm-up. Some of the most uncomfortable, poorly lit, elongated scenes are played with the flare of a Valium overdose. I wondered why they didn't just put the cue cards on camera, so the actors didn't have to look their way. Of course, the two main girls were chosen for their T & A factor rather than talent. Laurel Munson as the head chick Terry is so exciting that he looks like paint dry. Two nude screens make for an adolescent excitement. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy / creepy daughter and mother, the chicks find themselves stranded with competition for the worst acting ever. Long breaks, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a pleasure for those of us who love bad movies. The screens suddenly move with long blackouts that you can drive through a Mack truck. Cartoon lightning falls over shots without disturbing the air. Eighty-year eye shadow attacks the viewer. But you know it has grown on me. I was sorry for that. I wanted to embrace it, kiss it is boo-angry and make it better. The end does not matter for the damage it caused, but I smiled anyway. I have my own theories on the whole "forbidden" hype and hope everyone who chooses to watch this movie does it with substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise succeed.
