Corridors of Time are somehow a success story because the film reaches its goal: seen by thousands. But it failed to make them laugh. <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs was successful because the subject was an original way to consider the time series: forget about Zemeckis's Return to the Future, here comes the old France, the middle-aged knight and his almost barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> Nobody provided the great success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's no use to be a filmmaker to realize that the passages of time have been made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visitor and immediately tries the sequel with a time paradox that would need some second things. Explanation: It is not necessary to repair the jewelry; Jacquouille stole; don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the episode? Where do you think he found the money? Selling the jewelry ... And it's just one of the many holes that Poire tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the characters: Montmirail doesn't change, he's just a little more boring. As far as Frenegonde is concerned, it's another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in the future to prevent her from being caught in the bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin is trying to imitate her in a way that I've found so zealous. I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that a movie of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about the time travel, the digital effects, concentrate on the story and you'll see it There is enough space on a postage stamp to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this movie is the landscapes. A movie for young people, let's say up to 13 years old.
