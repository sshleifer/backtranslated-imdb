I recently searched online for a site that contains public domain movies. In their long list of movies, this film was and I thought I should hallucinate on such an offensive title and point of view. But no, it's really what it was. And since the movie was about 27 minutes long, I decided to try it. If it turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it seems the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team, with a budget of about $ 49, tried to make a Star Trek film about a crew of many gay men moving around the galaxy and wiping out female oppression by killing all the women - as they continued got on the earth! And in each case, they met with joy and thanks from the now-gay men of the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, that's not. With some of the most obscure and young names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without removing my review! But despite the utter madness of it all, it was strangely observable and worth it. But, as I have already mentioned, because of the rough names and strange subject (although no nudity), it is just an adult movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions about who would make it, WHY, make it and who was the intended audience? This may not be the absolute worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and possibly the most offensive!
