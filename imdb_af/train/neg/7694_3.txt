Unless you're twelve, this movie isn't really worth it. Of course, it's a low-budget movie with B actors, and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that isn't good. I knew it would be bad if I rented it. I enjoy laughing at bad movies. However, I didn't know how bad it was. It is portable, until after 2 hours, then it really starts to burn. Styles of battle go between normal battles that comply with the laws of physics and thread struggles. There is no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot, but again it is of course a child's movie. There seems to be clear moral lessons from the day being transmitted, such as Sesame Street or something. It's bearable. But much better if you say nine.
