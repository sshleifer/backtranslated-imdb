It's a horrible movie. Yes, the girls are pretty, but it's not very good. The plot that a cowboy has is involved with an Indian girl. It will be interesting if the sex doesn't get in the way. Well, okay, it can be interesting, but it is not, because it is so weak and only partially acted. I can only imagine what the thrills of the dance stops look like on a big screen, probably more laughing, then they do on TV. (I won't even call the topless knife fight between two women tied together and the whole thing spending breast on the chest. Never read about it in the old west). This is a movie that requires liberal use of fast forwarding. /> <br /> I like schlock movies, but it's ridiculous. There is a reason I am not going for these types of movies and they are not inclined to be very good because the plot takes a back for breasts. The original nudie cuties, as they are called, were originally nudist films or films that had no touch, but if the adult industry started to grow the filmmakers, they were trying to be clever or to try to use something else for chairs. seated. The smart people were very few who only had hacks of limited talent. The comedies often faced the best with the humor that reached the first level, childless but innocent fun. Something that can seldom be dressed over any other genre like a nudie. <br /> <br /> The Ramrodder looks good and has some nice pieces, but it is done by not being Western or sex movie. <Br /> <br /> I don't have to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Of interest to probably no one, the rapist and killer in the movie played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for a school teacher, was not long after filming was wrapped up no. <br /> <br /> Of course, these kinds of things will ruin people's lives.
