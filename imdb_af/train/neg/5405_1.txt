I have it as a turkey movie and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Acting - though many were in other movies, it was clear that they had to work hard to film so much about this whole movie with the occasional release of some play. <br /> <br /> Plot - generous I can say that the scriptwriter originally started with a plot, but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster when a Chinese beat computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. It failed to flow with any drive or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilies. The writing worked hard to make sure that no character managed to be regarded as memorable. I watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short-bus specialists. <br /> <br /> Directing - until you come up with your own directing skills, copy the style of your favorite director, otherwise you just make mistakes like this. <br /> <br /> It is good to know that your friends / family gave you 10 stars for this movie
