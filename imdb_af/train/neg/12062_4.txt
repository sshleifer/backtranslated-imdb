When great directors / actor combinations are spoken about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are usually not mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them entertain the spectrum of really good action to the mediocre. Unfortunately, Kitehite: Prohibited subjects fall into the latter. <br /> <br /> It's sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But for my life I don't understand why it was necessary to father the missing Japanese girl, a guy got some cheap jollies because the romance came out in his marriage. It may have been good for another movie, but it didn't matter. <br /> <br /> A straight cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice-cop who saw a bit too much in his line of work and a strong bias towards orientations. That part could also have used some explanation. But he'll have to overcome it if he and his patient, Perry Lopez, catch a Japanese schoolgirl. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time in the subgroup told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the man and he and Bronson have a history. In fact, in the best scene of the film, Bronson made him eat an expensive Rolex watch and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one time, Fernandez happens to mock Bronson and Lopez in a whole night's delicacy. His Rolex snack, he injects the place with a Uzi that kills everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a few VAPD vice-policemen after Fernandez. But it is quite a terrible hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is still a very rough justice for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie was better. It was the last movie of the Bronson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as director. He had to go with something better.
