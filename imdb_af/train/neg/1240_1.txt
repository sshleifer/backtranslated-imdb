I think everyone was disappointed with this sci-fi movie. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, rough and ridiculous. If you saw it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb says it's crazy and boy, are they right! If you don't, avoid it. It's a mustache. 1 out of 10.
