This movie was called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who haven't played the games, Need For Speed ​​is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This is perfect for Redline. The only thing about this A-level movie was the cars. The play was forced and written, the point of departure was weak at best, and the plot was almost inconsistent. I just really watched this movie to see how bad it was and although it was pretty bad it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they'd beat Eddie Griffin somewhere in the movie. All in all, it doesn't pay, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
