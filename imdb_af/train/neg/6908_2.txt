This range has potential, but I think the budget won't allow it to see that potential. An interesting set-up, other than 'lost', falls flat after the first episode. The entire series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90 minute movie, but the makers decided to drag it over and over. Many of the screens were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and didn't work overall. There were few characters we cared about, as their characters did not grow over time - well, one grew a bit. The end was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only kudos here are for the art dept and set dressers, they have created an interesting look, too bad, the author and director did not have the prospect of doing anything interesting with that element.
