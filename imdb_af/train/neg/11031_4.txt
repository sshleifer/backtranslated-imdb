It is interesting to see what the director tried with this movie. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the movie, and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were all a bit too shallow and you didn't suffer for any of them. <br /> <br /> Quite a bit (and sometimes straight, bad) photo seems a bit to be desired, but I don't think you can expect too much from people who just make a low budget film for the dick. It is unfair to review the movie and compare it to other high-budget movies. But unfortunately, that's what you have to do. It is not very good on its own. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it's not without his good points! I like the plot. It is pretty well built up and tied well to the end. Sometimes in the very dark scenes, it also created a flu feeling. <br /> <br /> But finally, the movie doesn't hit. The characters are almost non-existent and we don't care about any of them. Anyone can die, but it is possible to indicate the last "survivor" from early on.
