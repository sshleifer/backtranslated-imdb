Whatever you do, don't waste your time on this sentence. Movie. A remake that should not be recalled. Everyone who comes out of the theater has the same comment. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage was cycling hills, swimming in dark water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees. Yet his suit was still perfectly printed and shirt bright white to the very last scene. <br /> <br /> Although a good role play with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the play was just as incredible as the movie itself. It's great how good actors can do such bad movies. Don't even get a copy of the script. If you still have any interest in watching the movie, wait at least for the exhibition on DVD.
