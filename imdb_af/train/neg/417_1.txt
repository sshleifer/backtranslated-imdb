I come to the cinema every week, and look at this site regularly, but I have never before been forced to comment on a movie. <br /> <br /> To my entire list of shockingly bad movies - Last Man Standing, Herb, The Bone Collector - I can now add the drift that was "Hollow Man". <br /> <br /> From the horrible opening titles - a ridiculous overflow of cast and crew with alphabet spaghetti - into the abusive final - a world record number of clich√©s and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to make it into the theater ever. This movie is jealous and just the impressive computer graphics keep you going long before the time comes. end. <br /> <br /> It's not just my opinion - it was that of my friends and everyone around us. When large parts of an audience laugh and groan during and after a serious excitement, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it was also sick. The director took the action beyond the bounds of the realistic prize for a violent film, and in the realm of a baffled B-movie. It is difficult not to imagine the director as a dirty old man, because the magnitude of the invisible man's outbursts from the laboratory and in the outside world only prolongs two attempts to have a feeling of breast. Perhaps sex may be the first thing on a can's mind when made invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasure of the ladies involved, it hardly makes an entertaining theater. <br /> <br /> [spoils follow] <br /> Get past the movies out of doors and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job of distorting more and more "hollow man", the rest of them - who may be handicapped by a frightening act - do a better job of playing hollow role. A long-time member of the team is scratched by an invisible man in a safe. "He's finally broken," shakes one colleague without a hint of emotion. It's par for the course, and the lab team swings between sheer terror and complete indifference with so much speed that you wonder how they went in acting. They push their way through the lab corridors, frightened, ready guns, but then seconds later, one of the crew members happily jumped back in to get blood for a sore colleague. The chief female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humor even after he has insulted and abused her and there seems to be little reaction to his outbursts even after he drowned the Pentagon chief. He drowned in his pool last night. the same female, spectacular to gather two and two. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is littered with this kind of poorly performed pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of movie clips that go thicker and faster than the movie to the point of total disbelief and endurance at the end. . <br /> <br /> The 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female climbs out the window, the loops of security video - the list is really endless - the predictable ignorance of strength in numbers, the decision not to have the two main stars kill, but just put them in a place of probable threatening death and leave them to their own devices, the almost dead good guy who is out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous lands, the fireball blast that just burned before the heroes are reached, the gate just stopping before they hit them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad man. <br /> <br /> The invisible man was burned to a pinch with a flash of head flags, with a bar that was cut only by one of the smaller actors, and then the explosion, fireball and surviving the total destruction of the labs, more than enough survived to climb the fireball for a last pop at the movie heroes. At what stage is the unbeliever heard and watching their watches. <br /> <br /> That particular bad movie actually made it the theater is amazing. Even the name of the movie is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere to save this one, which should be avoided at all costs.
