At least it's not full of senseless violence or fluff. It is also not very full of thoughts or a smooth story. This story has some potential, but the director lost the field of green. The story is diverse and goes down in strange <br /> <br /> directions, to no conclusion. I also don't believe the director spent much time around a golf club. Some of these images are absurd. Not very engaging.
