Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects would have been wonderful. Better directing may have felt more and better performances from the actors. But nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it. Plotgate, bad lines, terrible pacing, endless repetition of the same shots of a CGI dragon hidden through corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. <br /> <br />
