Okay, so the previews on this movie just tell you that a rebellious young girl is going to live with her grandmother for the summer to come straight out. This is actually not the case! It's about a young rebellious 17-year-old girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe whether or not she is telling the truth. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a very good plot and a very good theme of a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I didn't enjoy watching Lindsay Lohan's play. In fact, this movie would have been great if they had someone else, maybe a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and it reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it takes a lot of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The end is quite large (and sad).
