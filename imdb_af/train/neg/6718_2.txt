I wanted to watch the movie because of an article in a movie magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The storyline is different and I'm sure it could be a good movie if it was in the right hands. Directing and acting was terrible !! I had the feeling of watching a movie made by a lot of amateurs. Although the movie started promising, it got worse and worse. I think it is an unmistakable movie with uncomfortable characters. I still think it's worth watching as I haven't seen movies that have gay porn. But don't keep your expectations high, then you'll be very disappointed. * from *****
