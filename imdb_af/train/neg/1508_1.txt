I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and didn't know what kept me in my seat. I think I just expected that a movie with Gere would eventually have a little value, but nothing of value ever came on the screen. The story is a vague excuse to strike after the shooting of slavery and torture. There is no character in the movie that does something like real life. The cut "style" relies on jumping cuts, mini flashbacks and overprints to give weight to this vapid set-up of a gang of sadists who seem to be running free for years and SORPRISE is the leader of a murderer. I don't see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent sexist trash.
