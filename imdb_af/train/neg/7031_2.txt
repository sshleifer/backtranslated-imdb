What made me film was the viewing Vampyres, I thought I should get the other movies this man (Larroz) made. It was a pity that I found it, this is a poor effort to load an occult / satanic type of sex with sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses, this is an excuse for sleaze. The only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere, avoiding this one, too much hype surrounding it, not worth finding it, it refers to I am welcome to see that he has some other movies that lead to Vampyres. goats are very boring, I understand that is what the hype carries.
