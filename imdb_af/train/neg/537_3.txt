I went to see "Evening" because of the cast. I went to see the "Norman's Room" - the movie Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and also Meryl Streep - and loved every minute of it. The same for "The Notebook" even though it was a chick flash. And my feeling was, anything offered by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I sometimes found, even the greatest actors could not conquer trite, simplistic, and - on one occasion - truly offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problem with the way the movie is structured. I actually enjoy movies that move back and forth to tell a story ... as long as one era relieves the other and decorates it freshly. But while Vanessa's character was on her deathbed and remembered an event in the past, she felt it was a mistake. It was disillusioned. Sometimes the part that actually shows what the "past mistake" was, nothing to explain the matter. In fact, it makes it pointless in the silliest "girl meets boy, girl gets son, girl loses son" fashion, and in the most incredible, cliché, wrong way. <br /> <br /> And here's the spoils, so keep that in mind as you keep reading. <br /> <br /> First, Claire Danes was brutally overlooked. Not only does she start to look like Vanessa Redgrave when a young woman does not look, she has nowhere near the cocktails when it comes to acting. Don't get me wrong, she can be right in the right role - just not this one. And Patrick Wilson was disgusted, even though he had the actors to pull it out. He was better suited to the part played by Hugh Dancy - the rich confused WASP - not the object of sexual attraction to everyone; He's a bit too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? One note - "I'm tortured drunk and wait until you find out why." And the "why" (I'm a cache case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink excess and make a fool of myself before everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the way he died ( as you knew he would do it because it was the only thing that could happen to a torch in the fifties, so ridiculous, wrong and wrong, I almost threw my candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of dedication, her jealousy about her sister's "perfect life", her sister wonders if she has the right choices, her pregnancy and her - perfect boyfriend (who was actually more interesting and played significantly than Patrick Wilson, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach might have been a more interesting Harris who gave his dreamy eyes). Anyway, it was all in the 70's and 80's. And in much greater depth. Do we really have to leave it again, and everything as if it was fresh and essential? <br /> <br /> On top, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in the old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She is still good, but just because she can find Meryl and Meryl a way to get even the silliest dialogue under the toughest makeup. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, this movie has every cliché in the "really meaningful message" movie book, and it adds a few that really didn't matter anymore. At two hours and with a "Lifetime Movie of the Week" music guaranteed to rub your grief, it's a complete failure in both "meaningful" and "moving" aspects. I only give it 3 for Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, as everything you need from your movies is twadd, please leave my comment on "Evening" and get the time of your life. But if you want a truly sensible experience, it is served by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings, rent Norman's Room and find out what is real great play is.
