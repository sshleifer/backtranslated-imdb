Not even the most fiery stooge fan can keep the film, like me, from the stooges, just no material to work with. It is also a pity, as it is the only feature length film that has stooped with curly, and this one effort of them is painfully unfunny, when it could have great potential. Terrible music numbers don't help either. The short that they did with the same title has more laughter.
