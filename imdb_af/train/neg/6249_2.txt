(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There's one good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (make up for what you want): the opening theme. It must be the coolest theme music of any frightened Japanese anime TV show made for consumer-oops-I-average-the-young fans. Unfortunately, after the opening theme, some sort of show had to be added. And they just couldn't show anything more interesting than people arguing aloud whose cards are better than the others' cards. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I can't imagine why any kids want to go through a show where the dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes 98% of the running time. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your virgin Pyramid Diamond Animal into a single strike! Can't you see you have no chance of winning this battle, fool you? ! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! " <br /> <br /> "Oh yeah, well, watch it! I'm going to use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card that erases each of your Power Munchers and your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature from Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond All Significance Attack useless! bet, you haven't seen one come! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, it's all they ever do in this show. While I'm in another baby show I warned, namely the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (every soccer mom's pet), the monsters have the least to say, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is Just in the silent words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange Review, "plain talky and drilling". Not to say, I've been wondering for a long time (I realize I'm hypocritical about that, considering the sentence I just wrote.) <br /> <br /> This show goes on forever. I do not know if there is a plot, and the static samples do not have any of the character of Pokémon. Even when it is not compared to my fave cartoon as a child, this performance sucks. It's unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. Goodbye, sleep now, dream wet dreams.
