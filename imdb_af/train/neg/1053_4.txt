Bizarre takes on the Cinderella story. Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent evil step-mother performance. <br /> <br /> Visually amazing in some parts, but it's about it. The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Fast forward until you see something interesting, and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drift. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story, I suggest: "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "The Glass Slipper".
