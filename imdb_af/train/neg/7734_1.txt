This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak - I couldn't even follow it. The acting is high school. The soundtrack is irritating. The attempts at humor are not. The editing is terrible. The credits are even slow - I would be ashamed to have my name on this waste of film. Don't waste your time, even think of this attempt to act.
