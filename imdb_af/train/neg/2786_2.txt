Well, I'm not going to criticize this film in depth. I notice the many elogic reviews of mine before, and as I usually like Maria de Medeiros, I have long been reluctant to make a deviant comment - and nearly a year has come so far. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner groan. Anyway, the elogic voices let me down! But for other cinephiles like me, beware. <br /> <br /> Expressed in simplest and softest terms, here's my point of view: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and overthrow that sets the scene for this movie also served as a backdrop for " a certain period of my life - via newspapers I read daily in my local middle-European pub. At that time I followed the news reports, but I never fully understood what the cutter was. The reporters also tended to report either partisanly, or with a conservatism that had plagued any group to disrupt peace or to establish rebellion against the settlement. These were times when other winds of turmoil swung through Paris, Berlin, Prague and several places in the US, all of whose problems I clearly understood - but dictatorship or not, simply treated my newspapers to the government of Portugal as the establishment - not as an evil rich evil empire, to use a flickering star war. <br /> <br /> So every week after week I read about disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial version that might not provide the history behind them, or the practices and socio-economic impact of the dictatorship. judge. <br /> <br /> So, at the time of purchasing this movie, I had at least two hopes: to finally understand the details of social unrest and to enjoy a benevolent drama. This movie didn't give me either. <br /> <br /> The film assumes viewers already have the necessary knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts. And the drama, as I said, I would like to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but it was solid and level. <br /> <br /> I got my copy of the DVD from France - Choice Official Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard "The box shows laughing clean-cut actors, the head who gives the victory sign in a way that more of me Remembering the Playboy Bunny After seeing the work, I wondered what the French could think of it - but as a plain 'cinema verite' with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to do it for her. praise "honesty" but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Remember Chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm view? Try to describe Allende's overthrow and murder with " a "warm respect"! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the whole series of overthrows and civil rebellions! <br /> <br /> Another review: Maria de Medeiros, a new boy, pays " a boy, a boy, a boy. "Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish! least to me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal. All over Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities. But my love for a city and a country doesn't make a nice movie. I will stick to my antique VHS tapes from Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile, I'm stuck with a zone 2 with the above title that can go so well in the trash.
