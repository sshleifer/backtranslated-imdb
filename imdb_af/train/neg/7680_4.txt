Snowy is, in my opinion, a bad movie at the artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotyped, the editing too exaggerated. In any case, the film does not look like many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think it's a straight commercial thing. Including a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor IS the leader of the group he is mentioned with the film - SENS UNIK). It looks like a bigger audience. A straight German-Swiss movie would not have sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really was on my nerves was the product placements across the movie. Sometines scenes remember from ad clips! <br /> <br /> I also think the topic "young people who use drugs without any other targets in their lives" is a wide spread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be worked out with more care. I hope Samir has enough money with Snow White so his next film will show his true artistic skills.
