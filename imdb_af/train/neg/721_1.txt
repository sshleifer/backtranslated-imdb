This movie has several important flaws. The first and most important is the clear lack of a good plot! Unfortunately, it does not only make the movie difficult to watch, but also sends the keeper some feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting his valuable time of their short life. This means that the movie cannot captivate its audience, but it encourages the viewing audience to get contempt for the film and all that goes with it! In short, it's really very, very, very, very, very, very much BAD! Do yourself a favor and chew on big rubber shoes, you'll find it much more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
