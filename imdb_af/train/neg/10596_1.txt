Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. THERE ARE WE going. Now we know this movie is really terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But I didn't even think this would be bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme gets old (eventually), but unlike Arnold, his movies are too. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. Don't see it. Ever. I won't even be paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in his heart lies a wonderful, action-packed excitement ride. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe, but the marketers will sure we should think so, wouldn't it? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
