I saw it in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday I saw it again on the cable. It was my ability to remind myself with the sense of how rebellious this movie is. The whole lot of characters are self-absorbed narcissistic princes. Worst of all, it strengthens every negative stereotype about 20-something dating, even if it claims people are "themselves". The cute guys finish last, the rough guys are doing well, the toughest guys do the best. The girls are all boys toy pushovers. Only one character ("Wendy") is seen to be extremely useful to society, and with her long-saved virginity in a disposable one-night stand with a scumbag, in a lazy-filmed scene we suppose is to think, is romantic. What it really is is Hollywood's concept of young America: permissive, detached, debauchery, arrogant.
