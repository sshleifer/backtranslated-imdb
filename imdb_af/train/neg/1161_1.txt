As a member of the film, I was a member of the group at all the basketball games. I wanted to let the world know when I was in the movie, that we didn't allow it to be seen, as it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and the director who broke the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. Looks like the U of O sign is shown. While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat various meals at the casting and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was pretty unforgettable because he was one of the worst men I ever met. Totally a time for a young 20-year-old. Certainly not what campus life really was in the late 60's and early 70's, despite what Hollywood might think. Oregon Trombone Player
