It just seems bizarre that someone reads this script and thought, "It's funny! I mean, it's so hilarious, it just has to be made!" Who was this person? Is he or she really the person responsible for this? Are they the one who owes me time, more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in the most possible terms. There is not one of the good dialogue, and not one nice character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the very worst movie ever, Hulk Hogan's "No Hold's Barred". It almost looks like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The end is poured out with a few minutes of outings, and it's still less than 80 minutes. The outtakes include the role-players who laugh at the 'hilarious' mistakes they made, and things that went wrong on the set of this 'comedy'. Stay tuned to someone who's laughing somewhere, with a bit of connection with this 'movie'. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing. It just goes on and on. It's really that lamb. I love movies that are so bad they are good. It's so bad it's ... something, but I don't know what and hopefully never will. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet doesn't suck straight and is actually the only half good thing about this wannabe movie. But this really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
