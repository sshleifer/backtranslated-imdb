In short, the film had a bit of a bad 1st action with some forced acting and somewhat unfounded rhythm and pacing, a bit of a decent 2nd act that managed to build tension and plot despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the throw, and the third act ... there was virtually no third action! <br /> <br /> Regarding the 3rd action, the movie does not end suddenly. There is no resolution and no way off the climax of the 2nd act, so there wasn't much of a 3rd action. The bad guys die and that's it; the end credits role. There is nothing to show about the protagonist and the supporting characters, and so on. The audience would probably have left the theater behind the movie and asked "this is it?" A real eavesdropping. <br /> <br /> Music was compiled by David Bell, enough to serve the movie most of the time, but it is definitely not outstanding. It is only functional, but it is achieved by being generic and derivatives. It is also clear that the score is very outdated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. What impressed me at least is that some tension moments sound like musical tests as they were ripped off by James Horner of 48 HRS. and "Commando", especially the buyer. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film had potential as the basic story itself was good, but the performance was slender with mediocre direction, poorly acting and somewhat inconsistent pacing. br /> <br /> There was virtually no third action to complete the story properly, and this failure is huge and unforgivable, as it does not allow the movie to end satisfactorily. This could be either the script or possibly the production had to eliminate the filming or editing of the 3rd act in the final movie due to budget constraints (but I wonder why there is no third action). Whatever the reason, the sudden end makes the movie totally hurt. <br /> <br /> It's great for a show if you're curious and you can get the movie for LOT cheap as well as learn the reason WHY you should have the 3 actions (start, middle and end) than you write screens and make movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to laugh at least.
