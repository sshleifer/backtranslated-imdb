After Disney's witty living action, George of the Jungle, I had great hope for this movie. Great disappointment. Wire-based plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This movie relied on lame one-liners, idiotic (and useless) product placement, and the most annoying silk speed in that little thing. I took two young children to see it and they got bored. The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby or when one needed a laugh, a man showed it in the groin!
