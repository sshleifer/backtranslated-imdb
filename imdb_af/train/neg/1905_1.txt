I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and has probably reviewed more Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. Every movie he made from the beginning of his career to early 30's with just two exceptions, I reviewed so you can say I'm a big fan. This is because I found this episode so painful and difficult to watch. I loved this man's movies and thought "Buster, how can you?" Well, now that I think about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton played in this divine episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He lost much of his fortune in the early 1930s after having had a rough divorce in the early 1930s, and his film career as a leader has long been over. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his revival in popularity. So he excited him to anyone who was willing to pay - which appeared in Strandfilms and this mess of a huge series episode. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserves much better. The show is supposed to be funny, but it is not and instead of a tribute to silent movies, it is just painful to watch - especially with Keaton who puts the deadly travel helmet on the badly slapstick. Do yourself a favor, CREATE THIS ONE - this is a pale imitation of the greatness that once was Keaton's career !!!
