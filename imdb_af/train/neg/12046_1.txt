I had High Hope for Troy and I'm so bitterly disappointed. The film was so badly directed that it made my stomach ache. The pacing was so slow, the dialogue was laughing and the movie - and apart from a nice battle scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana). The rest was level. <br /> <br /> And why, oh why Hollywood always strives to rewrite stories to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was murdered by Paris, outside the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It irritates me that such a classic story as it has changed into a soap. <br /> <br /> Not even starting with the "lack of chemistry" between Helen and Paris. She was the woman over which the war was fought and it didn't even seem like the two of them cared much. No sparks, no emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say in the movie defense, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole dealt very well with a bad manuscript, but it's not enough to save this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the Â£ 200m budget goes? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral - where did they find all the trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed that it hurts.
