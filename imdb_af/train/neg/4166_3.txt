Full time wasting .... This movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not novels ... not even teenage comedy !!! Story ... it has to be one side a few times ... but it's so disappointing! When the movie turns out in the end, I expect the conversion to make the movie even better (exp. "Fight Club"), but this cover makes film even worse. If I watch teenage comedy, and I don't do it very often, I expect lousy jokes and a lot of sobriety ... Jokes are mean and there's no nudity. You only have one .... very good, I have to admit ... girl, and that's it! And she's got full movie! Acting is bad ... like soap series ... Don't waste your time! There are pornography with a better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
