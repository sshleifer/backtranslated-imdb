I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs offered Monster at TNT. Even he can't make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched it to the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never did that badly. But it needs all my guts to go through it. It's like watching your grandmother thrive with a 15-year-old boy ... unnecessarily painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the real movie, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the bakkie at S-Mart, it is back as if it were a rattlesnake.
