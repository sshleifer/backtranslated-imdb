I think the young people involved in making "Necromancy" ("The Witching" plus a bunch of other titles) had to feel a little strange being on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated in John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play ("The Cradle Will Rock"); frightened people to think that strangers have come in ("The World War"); and director and die in the biggest movie of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles went into a third-flash movie about a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is basically nothing creative about this movie. Very nudity, but the background music always proves really distracting. Even if the movie wasn't very predictable, it wasn't worth seeing. How low Welles sank. Fortunately, over the past thirteen years of his life, he told the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros cartoons of the 1940s) and presented the documentary "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend the two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also with Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
