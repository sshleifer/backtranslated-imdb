SLIP SPOILERS (but it doesn't matter). <br /> <br /> An exercise in gobbling of catastrophic relationships, not even worth the l0 lines, I have to put on the net waves. This is the only worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first to qualify for the absent Mystery Science Theater treatment. Even though it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very lame debris. Its only value lies in the perspective of forcing it to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks, the genre only succeeds when using classical films of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master. Period. And no solid analysis of the easy social commentary in this will change it. Strangely, Carpenter was never anything more than a B-director, but at least such films as 'Mist' and 'The Thing' had a great atmosphere (the latter being one of my cultural favorites). <br /> <br /> Horrible acting. Camera angles fixed in cement. Stressless rhythm. However, perhaps the most unpleasant element of the episode is the storyline that can of course not be regretted (unless the authors were friends of Cody.) The initial two-minute slo-mo of a girl just walking through a forest to almost be Scully-Mulder duo is the first and last thing to work in the movie. But come on, a girl coming through an abandoned forest, especially after a desperate need for an abortion regretted by the screen of a women's chief, whose clinic is just at the end of the road remains the corner. Oh, and I won't even nipple on how the doctor whips the car accident and moves at 0 to 60 in six seconds. Must wonder for possible broken ribs or concussion. <br /> <br /> Then things fall apart, really fast. The turbulent dialogue "I just want to help you", the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like the telephone line (in the age of mobile phones?), Followed by the shootings: a born Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen break for a few kicks during Easter. Another beautiful line: "So, what are we going to do?" of the child who was just sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the bus. There is no, it's not yet a phantom season. So who needs the teenage boys anyway. How about the good, old, proven method of lonely male that spoils its way through the gate with its all-American SUV? <br /> <br /> As for the bullet exchange itself, the cuts were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comic strip. All that was missing was the Wham, Bam and Whiz of the balloon titles. And all that a soundtrack is worthy of an old Mannix episode. <br /> <br /> At one point, we learn that Dad isn't really the father, but at this point we aren't led to much caring anymore. This story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is just grateful that she doesn't have twins. Yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are actually ever found together. They remain bare abstracts throughout. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the gatekeeper, each one of these characters is absolutely unwell. Mix, hysterical, dull head, macho. As completely flat as human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. And there is that scary Dad who sends his pregnant daughter as if he were the stressed guy himself. Fortunately, he had his. There are two great MST-worthy comic moments: the gouser when Angelica's plumber goes out and later the newborn lobster with a glue on the baby's head. Also cute was Angelica's rugby ball belly before finally beating the right-to-life little monster out of hell. As for that brave male abortion scene ... they had to keep Miike's episode and banned instead. <br /> <br /> In short, a 3rd prize Rosemary's Baby meets Alien on the grass of a M.A.S.H. episode. This stinker alone, worthy of only today 's 16 - year permissive, will surely, as anyone else has said here, not be renewed for a third season. A real shame as there are a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs like Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee's wonderfully quirky 'Sick Girl'. Not to mention the wonderful images of Malone's 'Fairhaired Child'. <br /> <br /> Sorry John Carpenter, I believe your government days are over. It's time to run for president.
