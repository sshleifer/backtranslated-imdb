OK, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is never, never and will never be a funny man as long as we point posteriorly in the south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, undoubtedly because of the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team-working characters in the series who perfectly contributed to one of the funniest and most useless situations America ever produced. How anyone can have the audacity to even repeat the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. For compounding, the exercise was repeated in Martin's careless attempt to be Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to restore a demonstrable unfunny career. Some of your contributors say 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character' because I will say 'balderdash', his depictions will long be forgotten than those of Silvers and Sellars for future generations will be appreciated.
