I saw this movie on a 'preview' and I must honestly admit that I do not like films with Meryl Streep. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the break halfway through the film. I couldn't blame them. If it wasn't a real story, there was absolutely no need for the second half of the picture. Just before the film goes forward in ten years, I myself expected the credits to appear.
