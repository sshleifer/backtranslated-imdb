If it wasn't for the bad dialogues and writing. I mean, the direction was really in touch with his subject. The actors did well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, the thing that was really missing was a solid scrip to keep all the pieces together. I would highly recommend not seeing it. Unless you're an All Pacino enthusiast, I'll see everything he plays. Even though the rash has been quite poor lately. It is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
