This movie is the worst I've seen in the past 5 years. It is amazing how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie have accepted to act in such a worthless resting place. The film is rape / beat and revenge genre. Couple went to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it if a jeep full of bad guys came. He didn't go to their car, but instead he was kicked and beaten as she tried to seduce the car's engine and betrayed her and she was raped. Then she's somehow in her father's house and one of the bad guys is her neighbor, so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenario! Under Hollywood! He was against that revenge, but "she is raped." "They laughed at her" so she had to kill them all ... But once in the house she was content by pushing the gun's top into the guys and going away while he was mad and out of bad guys. Personally, I think the director runs out of money before it's finished because the movie ends before they execute someone else involved in this gang rape. This is not a big surprise, as the sponsor obviously saw it and wanted to withdraw his money. LoL This movie is not even for people who like to watch rape, because they will see nothing they are looking for. This director must be banned. This is upset by the fact that British peace-of-mind animation made this peace-of-mind. I personally like it and that's why I watched it. Don't do it yourself, you have better things to do that watch dull movie scenes.
