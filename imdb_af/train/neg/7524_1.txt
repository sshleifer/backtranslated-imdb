A handful of critics have given this film positive comments. I don't want to argue with their opinion, but I disagree completely. When I first watched this movie, I was slightly impressed. But after comparing with other films, especially with the late master, Bruce Lee quickly changed me. In fact, if it wasn't for the title of the movie, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 does not relate to the original game of death, except that it shares one character, Billy Lo. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see similar game of death 2 being compared to the dragon. The images have striking similarities: Both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two places are similar, in which they are both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent two guest rooms in both films.) Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's handler were missing a hand. They are an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon, the director used his imagination and granted Lewis with a pet monkey! The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Concerning other aspects of the film, such as the writing and the play, I felt it was very poor. It was for me the director was looking for a group of martial artists to die in the film and pray that they could act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can't deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the battle order has strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are nevertheless skillfully executed. However, since the plot is insufficient, I could not relate to the characters. Therefore, the battle order was more exhibited rather than having a meaning for the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would say this movie is recommended to any martial arts fans, but for those who enjoy a solid action movie, with a good story and strong characters, I would not recommend this movie seriously. no. . My views on this film may seem biased and unilateral, but when Bruce Lee made a new standard in the martial arts theater, especially to his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film did not rise to these standards. As something they emulate a truly brilliant martial arts movie, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> With regard to my evaluation, the awarding of this movie a very hard 1 out of 10, the movie barley is viewable, and should be grateful that it has the battle order it did.
