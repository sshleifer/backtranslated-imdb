<br /> <br /> Cheap and ugly, this movie doesn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience except for a pretty amusing toilet ghost. Christopher Lloyd is beyond his prime and is actually very tiring in this role, though the sorry excuse for jokes by the authors does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassing amateur in a so-called comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this movie, especially since it is inevitable to compare it with Robin Williams's often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
