I'm usually disappointed by network movies. Even those big-name actors are often spoiled by TV people. However, this one is the worst of the worst. The script is weak and the acting, especially that of Tracey Pollan, is horrible. I trusted to see and treat my children's high school games. Pollan pretends to read the script while she is speaking. When she tries to express fear, anger or sadness, it is extremely hollow. Due to the overall quality of the production I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to be brave, just be prepared for a great disappointment. Scary things won't scare you, sad things won't make you sad, romance won't make you feel hot and vague, and you'll probably be as anxious as I see the end coming. "First to die" says a lot about this movie.
