Just what we need! Another remake of cute Hollywood theater, with Eddie Murphy again in his second time, after the USEFUL PROFESSOR (1996). It shows why we no longer have special ideas for making a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its similar and beautiful images of animals that can act and speak to humans. Unfortunately, things can only get worse. Bathroom jokes and sexual references murder this piece of "family" funfare instantly. Even parents and children saw the trailer's ad on The Family Channel, which was followed by heavy anxiety and horror in the movie. Sad to say it's the more progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it's expensive, because things can only get worse over time. More went wrong with the all-new DR. Dolittle. It is absolutely unpleasant, too flat. I also hate that annoying voice from Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voice surplus than a lot of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy. I will have to agree on my local newspaper that gives it among the top five worst movies of 1998. Then the original version wasn't good either. Murphy's next project can be PATTON if he's not careful!
