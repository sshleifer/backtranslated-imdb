I have nothing more to say, but it was terrible. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this humiliating mess. And if some actors don't want people to question their sexuality, they may have to refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one who left me curious. Just my opinion. SHOULD to think about what was cut from the film. VIEW to wonder what went on by the minds of the actors who made this film. Shake to think about the thought process and voyeurism that goes on in the director's mind. As I said before, it's a humiliating mess. It's not even funny. As Ebert told Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
