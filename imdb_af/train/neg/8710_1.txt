I didn't see the first two - just this one called Primal Species in England. I don't think I'll bother it. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible movie. Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber samples. Everything about it is so nasty. The most sympathetic characters die very quickly and leave you with the annoying kids, especially one called Polchak, which is an incredible push. Nobody like it would survive in the army for 5 minutes. He lasted for centuries, but I was happy when he finally chewed his head - I had nightmares that he was going to survive. The colonel was also garbage - all minds and screams. And the specky doctor looked and acted like she was from a porn. I waited for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and make a vamp, but she didn't. Too bad that, as it would have been, the movie didn't go up. <br /> <br /> Didn't Roger Corman ever make half a decent movie?
