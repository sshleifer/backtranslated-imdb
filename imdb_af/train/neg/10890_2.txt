I thought this movie was pretty lame. If you are looking for cheese, you may like it. I, myself, don't care about a good amount of cheese, but it was ridiculous. The course of the movie bored me and the storyline was very poor. <br /> <br /> The only thing entertaining about this movie was the day-to-day zombies, but even that is not reason enough to see this movie.
