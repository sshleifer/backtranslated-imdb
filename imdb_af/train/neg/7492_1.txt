Apparently, most viewers do not know about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Hitler and Stalin era. Nuremberg (and many forgotten trials across Europe) was a vengeance and injustice of the winners. What do you think was why there were no US, British, French or Soviet defendants after World War II? There were no American, British etc. War Crimes? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not really a consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (It was also a book title in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible, inexorable US brainwashing instrument, full of error, lie, propaganda, bias and injustice. And in the first place: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why wasn't the Nuremberg process enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the true cause of the massacre in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would be jealous of this ...
