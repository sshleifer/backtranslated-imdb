Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but it was really bad. The kind of bad thing that makes you wish can get back into your life that time, the kind of bad thing that makes you think "what on earth they think of it in the first place", the kind of bad thing that makes you wish 50 minutes when you flew into the kitchen to get a snack during the movie. The kind of leprosy bad looks nice, the kind of bad thing that makes you suspect you have hired a Pauly Shore movie. Certainly, I can't explain how bad it was. <br /> <br /> It said .... there were some semi-amusing laughs, but they were all so much FUN funny than Anchorman. Sure, they were trying to make it entertaining and fun, but the whole subplot left from Anchorman who made it here was really left out. It wasn't even good. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in the US, a favor) and don't look at this DVD ... it will blur the good movie that Anchorman is and doesn't want to do. <br /> <br /> Well ... I'm fine now.
