was the kind of this movie to the editions of Ed Norton's face. Without revealing any plot details - one afternoon he had a light beard, but by the same night the beard was gone and a very luxurious mustache was in place. It was much fuller than the mustache that went with the beard. Later, in the dark night in the open, the mustache was gone and he appeared in the beauty house. It was on an occasion where it would not be shaving. These continuity differences completely distracted me from the rest of the movie and destroyed any credibility it had before. I also found the long scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom, and it was also reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Even if it was a tribute, it was too thick for this viewer.
