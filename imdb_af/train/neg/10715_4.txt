What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and credible point of departure and with a decent and talented role, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really did. There was a little excitement as we found out that Angie wasn't really pregnant, and found out she was, but it is. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually produces a movie, was terrific and his whole character was not even close to the importance of this movie, except for making it longer. I'd love to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe I'm not trying for a pure comedy that unfortunately wasn't, but maybe a drama with comic elements. I think if the film did it, it could have been very funny, as both actresses are funny in their own ways and here are many scenarios that would be a riot.
