Currently this movie is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made. That's exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am sad to report that the movie, while it is bad, is not nearly enough to earn in the bottom 100 movies ever made. I saw at least 100 movies worse than this one. Hardly a glowing endorsement, but it just didn't meet the expected level of fear to be included in this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their delayed honeymoon (en route, they are also married in real life). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very silly (hallmark of a bad movie) and are soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the US - both are not true at all. <br /> <br /> Strange, after being bitten, the man doesn't even stop going to hospital !! The first thing on someone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help right away, but not this boob. Soon he has attacks - but he is still not interested in seeking help! Again and again you think it must be the stupid couple in film history !! <br /> <br /> After a while he eventually goes to the doctor and is sent to hospital. But by the time it is too late and its attacks become more violent and it kills people to suck their blood. When it is clear to everyone that the man is a crazy murder machine, the woman (who had a grapefruit for her brain like her husband) refused to believe that he was dangerous - even after he attacked people. an ambulance steal and a police car off the road !! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, Moss goes through these episodes, his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. Strange, but a few times he developed bat-like hands and at the end they used some nice prostheses on him to make him look. If it were really cheese, the movie would earn a 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, in a twist that made no sense at all, the woman inexplicably turned into a mad bat lady and killed a swarm of bats the evil sheriff. How it all was arranged was a mystery such as Moss and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their career - both had fairly long careers on TV, which played a role since 1974. <br /> <br /> Overall, very stupid. The plot is stupid and makes no sense and strongly relies on people who are stupid to be real. Not a good movie, but not one of the worst movies. <br /> <br /> NOTE: IMDb somehow shows the graphics for the three DVD sets for IT'S ALIVE and these are two successors to the BAT PEOPLE website. While the BAT people were seen with the title "It's Alive", the two movies are not related at all. It's easy to understand the mistake - especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie I just checked was standing by Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew. The other movie was John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
