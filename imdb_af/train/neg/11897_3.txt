William Lustig's succession of "Maniac" certainly proves that without Tom Savini's spectacular effects and Spinell's convincing performance, "Maniac" never became the cult hit that did it. "Vigilante" is badly targeted, with simple thoughts that spell everything out for you and predictable at every turn, and also mediocre performances by all actors. To judge by the deja vu that this movie gave me, Lustig watched a couple of times "Death Wish" before it was made! (* 1/2)
