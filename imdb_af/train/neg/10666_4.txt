I'm a big movie from 1930 and will see most of everything I see on Turner Classic Movies. So I gave it a shot, it's the great Harold Lloyd who competed Chaplin as a big silent movie comedian. I watched many of Lloyd's silent movies, then of Chaplins, but I have to say I'm a much larger Chaplin fan. Anyway, this movie became so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his good career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgotten. I was also interested to watch Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths of Glory, but his role here has not done anything special to me. Maybe they had to get into the box earlier, because at least half of the film (at least it was) looked before coming into a ring. I can say there are many Lloyd fans here and it won't be a popular review, but I have to compare it to what else was out there, 4 out of 10. Don't see it with anyone you're trying to get like old movies as they might not look another one with you, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked or was looking for more well-known comedies in general, I recommend Kelly The Second was made a few years earlier, and no one becomes a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and in " a supporting role. Charles Chase. It's both shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
