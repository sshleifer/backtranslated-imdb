Beautiful poor Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad movie. How disappointing it is from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government contractors do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy born from the experiment is constantly running a 100-degree fever, and if he is an adult, people in his life start spontaneously burning. He's trying to figure out why. <br /> <br /> The people who are completely on fire are well done, but when they come to the point that they are well done in a different sense, they are naturally changed to dummies. When fireflies shoot out of characters' arms, it looks stupid, rather than the way it should offend. Also ridiculous is fire that apparently moves through telephone lines and breaks out into large appliances from the receiver's earpiece. How should this happen? <br /> <br /> Something else that struck me as stupid about the movie is when a character has visions of his old parents. We see exactly the same shots of those visions in home movies.
