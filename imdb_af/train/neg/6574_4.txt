I got the tape from my local library, which kept a copy for clear reasons. <br /> <br /> Once I went to the village of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there I saw the schedule for the city theater citra in May 1954. Movies will change every day at the theater. Since there had not been a decade or so in those parts, it was much of the entertainment available in the town. "The Raid" seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950s. Although not listed for that month, I certainly showed up there yesterday afternoon or Tuesday night for an audience that probably wasn't too demanding. The historic attacks - daring and remarkably successful - don't look very well researched, so the movie is full of Hollywood decorations, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice Liberty Valance. And St Albans apparently had more Yankee soldiers going through town and going to Washington DC. <br /> <br /> What made me really nicer was when the raiders turned into their Confederate uniforms. Only in sticky Civil War paintings, Rebel uniforms look so pristine. When Anne Bancroft's son caught up in his uniform just before the attack, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then there is Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I actually watched the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The actress in the studio contract does not look like her later movies, and has nothing of the presence she later in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God", and of course "The Graduate." <br /> <br /> Appreciate as just 1). you live in St Albans and 2). you have a few hours to kill on a Hollywood fictionalization of your hometown's biggest news story.
