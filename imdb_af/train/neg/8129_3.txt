Sometimes I try and try to be charitable for all the B to Z grade movies out there, but at some point a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to hit everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I saw under the title "It Lives By Night") is just such a movie. You can't see it without thinking that it really should have been an episode on Night Gallery, and not one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> The movie has something to do with a doctor bitten by a bat and, consequently, begins to morph into a Were-Bat that drinks human blood. (Actually you would think if he became a real bat, he would eat mosquitoes at the gallon bucket, but because it is a cheap, tricky horror movie, the word is the blood.) Despite the fact that he has a big abuse at the drop of a hat, and almost every night his friend and co-doctor, dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, an "allergic reaction" to the rabies shots. Meanwhile, the world's most unpleasant and stereotypical county sheriff suspects the doctor to be responsible for the cruel murder and postponement of several local girls (and one wino). Meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in Egypt and alternately protects and seduces him. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that the acting is bad - you can say that the actors make professional levels and try to put juice and life into writing, even the man who plays the sheriff. (Well, it's pretty bad, but it's bad in a clichéd, wood, professional way). It's just about everything about the acting, the way the screens fit, the costumes, the dialogue, the writing and the story line in general put your teeth on the edge and make you want it. <br /> I think the movie had an outside chance to be a haunting, disturbingly small culture favorite, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director had to be Michael Pataki, an experienced character actor, with defeat a chair until Pataki agreed to WET, not just Dennis Weaver's channel. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense about the whole "Bat Bites Human, then in a bat" situation. <br /> <br /> 3) He also needs the actor who played the doctor to get a little more physically credible little stage business for his "episodes", instead of going to the Man's A Seizure page of The Small Golden Book Clichéd Acting Mannerisms. <br /> <br /> 4) He had to recreate the whole woman's character, make her both more intelligent, less scary and fanatic. <br /> <br /> I'll never watch this movie again, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a stupid, humorous or interesting way. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld", though.
