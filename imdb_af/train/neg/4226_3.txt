Wow ... I can't believe just how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I heard the rumors, read the reviews - but had to make up for myself. Well, let me tell you - it blows up !!! The worst actor of any movie ever made, double that should have been done while everyone was involved, was completely messed up, indifferent and ridiculous, Gore FX, no observable plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandmother filmed it with her camcorder, weapon props No joke - made of tin foil - the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three guys are stranded on an island where a lot of weirdos roam with plastic and tin foil swords . Two of the inmates are freed with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's start before being hunted by the rest of the "tribe" ... it's pretty much ... <br /> < Honestly - this is one of the WORST movies I've ever had the accident to subject myself to. The budget had to be about $ 200 and was totally spent on the Gore FX (which might not be a bad idea ...). There is nothing but ZOMBIE DOOM except to be teamed up. This film makes other non-budget excursions like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD looks like TITANIES. Some may arrange ZD in the "so-bad-stuff" category - and I think you are really drunk or tall and consider it with some friends MST3K style - I think it can be looked at like that. But not by me. I pretty much hated everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally frightening and included as a "bonus" on the Shock-O-Rama release of ZD) indicates Andreas Schnaas's other works, then he must be banned from ever doing anything with making a movie ever again under the death penalty. There is an amusing kung-fu battle in the last half of the movie, and lots of blood - so I'll give this one a LARGE generous 3/10. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
