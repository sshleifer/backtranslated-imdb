Best of the best 4, is better than 3, but only rare. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (as they do) (ie, they do not refer to Tommy Lee with brothers and sisters). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I shared the Russian plot plot of the story, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen's bit as Boris. Apart from that and some fighting tones, the movie is nothing special. The limited budget is also very conspicuous (especially in the airplane inflatable scene). <br /> <br /> Also part 4 doesn't really have a moral or say something like part 3, there are a few more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). Alas, it looks like the best of the best the Rhee show, and to be true, he can't carry a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw on tape, Rating: 4
