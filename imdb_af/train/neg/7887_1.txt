... then they will have a proper place to file this crap. Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is religious mumbo jumbo. I was waiting for the "unthinkable evil" that promised me, but the "evil" in this movie would only be unimaginable by a five-year-old with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can't believe they actually managed to find some big name actors willing to get involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, it has always changed my opinion of them, and I will probably avoid anything they do in the future. I am also a little cute that I now have a writer's name and director's name to remember, because from now on I will avoid anything they do like the plague. <br /> <br /> It is really a pity that all the religious fanatics put here and say that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will leave their reviews first. This can lead to more people being deceived, as I believe this movie was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it goes to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. They couldn't give me the 105 minutes I wasted, and I thought it was a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
