Although I rated this movie, a 2 for a complete lack of effort to create a quality horror movie. It was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were, but I didn't mind, because I knew every scene had something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the film, but I believe it is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from start to finish, or if you watch it, you'll be confused with pleasure. I especially like the scene in which the prisoners take turns to knock outside with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius!
