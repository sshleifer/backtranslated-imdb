While it is not exactly offensive, the 1967 version of "The Perils of Pauline" is surely moronous. The title will lead you to a tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in the 1914 silent 20 episode series), but you'll be better served by the 1947 version with Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like a mix of "Casino Royale" and the worst of the Elvis movies. Worst of all, it's not a mix of these, but more like someone who cuts together segments so that the thing shifts back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> Which unit of production comes from Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a great game, as both lacked even the most basic acting ability (think Mandy Moore towards Dan Quayle) . <br /> <br /> Austin will later play John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade", with the talent gap between them actually painful to watch. In the mid-60s, she was the "Dodge Rebellion" girl, so she was in a similar set of dangerous situations. Imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jersey. When the agency's advertising agency replaced her with the "Dodge Fever" girl, someone had the bright idea to show her in a feature film. <br /> <br /> What story is there, starting with Pauline who grows up in the Baskerville Foundling Home who is acting by Ms. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. played on "Dobie Gillis", managed. George falls in love with her (Pauline-not Mrs Osborne) and sabotage several opportunities she must adopt. George leaves his fortune and 19-year-old Pauline gets a job to teach a young oily oriental prince. When he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem, she walks away and goes from danger to danger. It includes African pygmies, a 99Â½-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, the movie industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is It is meant to be stupid and charming but only manages the stupid part. There are a few attempts to take a silent movie to the action sequences by simulating the undercurrents of a camera (which accelerates the action). Unfortunately, everything else (movie inventory, production design, editing) was depressed in the 1960s. Nothing here even comes closer to the images of Pearl White stuck to a log moving to a bend or tied to the railroad waiting for the approaching train. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
