The Rainmaker, released in 1956, has some of the best actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. Not even can they completely save it from active melodrama. First, Hepburn is terribly disgusted as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, even though she can't pull it off. She is too strong to be credible if much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. Lancaster's actions to the limit, and Earl Holliman is much too hammy and comes more like Jethro Clampett. Just Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey look a bit above the saucepan - but even they can do just that. It looks like the 1950's was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings like an actress, and that's fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately, she didn't make too many of them for her supporters (among them). Despite an A list thrown and good production values, it doesn't work.
