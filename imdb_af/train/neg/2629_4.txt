Hollow is a good movie worth paying a half price or if nothing else is at a good time, with no thought needed. There are the necessary explosions and hammy acting and beautiful ladies. A fun throw with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow, and the beautiful Tia Carrere. This cast plus a light heart makes for a not a good movie, but a fun one. On a scale of one to ten ..a 4
