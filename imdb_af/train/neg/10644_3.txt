Well, here's another roll reversal movie. It was very worth looking at, despite the fatigue of gender reversal. However, this one is not. In previous reviews, I think, I made my point about the general decline in enjoyment for Haim movies that followed in the late 80s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Only one of the girls' is about a high school child (Corey Haim) trying to avoid his bulls by wearing a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading group and makes friends with fellow cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously he can't keep up with the charade for much longer. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was completely crap, and it wasn't even funny. But, according to a majority of reviews, Alanis Morrisette's or teen sex queen, Nicole Eggert, seems to be the only one who wants to see it. If you're looking for a good Haim feature (or rollover competition), look no further than 1989. It's about the point Haim's career thought.
