As others have noted, this movie is criminally inaccurate in the portrayal of the artist's life and I was a very annoyed and insulted ... by transforming her rape into a tragic love affair by the implication of her rapist was for 'awakening her talent', by his complete disregard for her work, by the way it changed her into a sex object, the idea is awakened. I also find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi will see this movie and go away with that kind of impression of her.
