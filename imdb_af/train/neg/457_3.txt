Sure, I like short cartoons, but I didn't like this one. Of course, children will love it. But then I am no longer a child (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I'll tell you nothing about the story, for the simple reason there's no story. How is it possible to name this dragon of a cartoon for an Oscar?! Well, I think it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now. In the present where we live, everything must happen quickly. Look at the movies these days and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. It's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30's because it looked so peaceful. But every time she gets up and down, I think ... <br /> <br /> To conclude: If you like music (and frogs), you should see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it.
