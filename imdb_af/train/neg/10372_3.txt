I enjoyed the first reviewer's comments much more than I did the movie when I saw it in a second race in the early 80s. I was then impressed with the care taken to make the costumes so modeled after the Tenniel drawings. But for me, the scroll hole was largely squandered, their personalities were muted by the masks, while the direction I considered was unusually static, and the photography dark. The rating that came down at that time was zero, which means it's not worth it to put through once. <br /> <br /> However, I would also get a chance to get a second look.
