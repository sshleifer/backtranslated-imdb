I really watched this movie late last night and usually when it's late, I'm pretty forgiving of movies. Although I tried, I couldn't stand this movie at all. It got worse and worse when the movie went on. Although I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and exuberant depiction of rural life. If that is what any of you think is the country's life, it's definitely not. However, I have to agree that some of the old members were nice, but the French man was really fake. However, I have to agree that this was a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one looks at eight, it's just too irritating.
