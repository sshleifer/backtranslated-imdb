<br /> <br /> Back in his youth, the old man with his first cousin wanted to marry, but his family banned it. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon the sister is bored with brother # 1, and jumps in the bed of brother # 2. <br /> <br /> One might think that the three brothers and sisters were trapped somewhere on a remote island.

We never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated man and one sister.

If movie is your cup of tea, SUNSHINE will slow you down
