However, awarding the budget and time constraints of serial production, Batman and ROBIN, deserve a place near the bottom of a "cliffhanger" list, without the style, imagination and atmosphere of its predecessor, BATMAN, in 1943. <br /> <br /> Producer, Sam Katzman, was known as "King of the Quickies" and, like his director, Spencer Bennett, was more concerned with speed and efficiency than with excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also produced the two Superman series, with Kirk Alyn, with a rocky flying animation, can of music and dull supporting players.) The opening of each chapter gives a taste of the following things: Rescue Batman, " Batman vs Wizard "), mechanical music drone, and our two heroes stumble down to look at the camera, either confused or difficult to see through their cheap Halloween masks. Batman's cow, with his devil's horns and eagle's jawbone, fits so badly that the stuntman must adjust it during the battle tones. Its "nut belt" is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, after which it can still pull a blowing force and an oxygen tube at critical moments! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the main players are ignored. Robert Lowery shows little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne, and doesn't cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman. He creates the impression that he is rather somewhere, nowhere else! John Duncan, as Robin, has major problems dealing with his limited dialogue. He is too old for the part, with an even older stuntman filling in for him. Out of costume, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen going out for a drink, without one of our chemistry occurring between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 series. <br /> <br /> Although magazines were not known For character development, the former BATMAN managed to give a more energetic role. This one offers a group through the movements, not that the filmmakers offer much support. None of the hoodlums stand out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, "The Wizard." (Great name!) Actually they are led by someone wearing a curtain, a scarf and a bag over his head, with a pinched voice trying to threaten desperately. The "main suspects" - an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster - are simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Even the established comic book "ordinary" is superfluous. It is difficult to distinguish many novels between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the dangers she faces, Vicki shows virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not too clear. Unlike the previous series, Alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose main line is "Mr Wayne's residence." They are props for a protracted, clumsy-loaded, incoherent plot, further seeded with uninspired, repetitive music and amateur production design. The Wayne Manor exterior looks like a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interiors of a cheap gorge. The Batcave is an office that desperately needs refurbishment. (The costumes are rolled up in a filing box!) <br /> <br /> Sorry, the filmmakers can no longer make an effort to create an exciting adventure. While the availability of the two series on DVD is a plus for any serious "Batfan", don't be fooled by the excellent boxing illustrations. They take more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined. <br /> <br /> Now for the good news - it's not the 1997 version!
