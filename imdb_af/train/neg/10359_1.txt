The "Wrinkle in Time" series is my favorite series from childhood. I read and read them more times than I can count the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and defects, are near and dear to my heart. This adaptation contains very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this movie would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you've never read the book (s), I think you'll enjoy the movie. The acting is over, the special effects are well done for a TV movie, and the story is interesting. But if you like the books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said of the movie," I expected it to be bad and that is. '<br /> <br /> I, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to drive this movie out of my mind.
