I argued with myself whether to rent it or not. I am always afraid to rent something I have never heard (do not remember in theaters). Great throw ... that's what the scales typed. For 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. It just gets worse. The authors of this movie can do some research on future projects if they want to make their movies a little better. Or they can just try to write something, just a little credible. I give it a 3 .... a 1 for writing (just because there are words) and a 2 to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite reading the script . Oh my god, this movie sucks.
