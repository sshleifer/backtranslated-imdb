I always wrote this series off as a complete feast because Jim Belushi was involved, and heavy. But then one day a tragic event took place. After a White Sox game ended, I realized that the remote control was somehow the other side of the room. Now I could just get up and walk over the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then, don't come straight up and walk across the country to watch television in another state? "Nuts to that," I said. So I decided to just hang on the couch and take what the lot was for me in the store. What was the fate of the store was an episode of this show, an episode of which I remember very little, except that I again made a very broad, general dirty blanket judgment on the basis of no objective or experiential evidence with nothing about me to give opinions back With, and again I was completely right! This show is a total mint! Belushi has all the comic deliveries of a hairy lighthouse hedge. The women are physically attractive but also Stepford is to provoke any real sense of the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running to the local TV station with a can of petrol and a flame maker and sending every copy of this mutt back to hell. <br /> <br /> Apart from the great comics by Larry Joe Campbell, America's largest comic character actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he's gold. How good is he really? Well, except to be funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. It's like trying to make the warts look. But Campbell pulls it off with style. Someone should find a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe, this show would consist of a slightly vacant search, Courtney Thorne-Smith, who hit Belushi over the head with a frying pan while beating his chest alternately and playing with the straw on the floor of his loft. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell named Comedic Bacon, because he is improving the smell of everything he does!
