Dialogue: stilted, clichéd; Acting: hammy, clichéd; Plot: predictable, clichéd. <br /> <br /> What does Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski do in this "B" waste? Plummer was well-established decades before this movie was made, and Kinski had masterpieces like Tess and Cat People behind her. Must be desperate. The bad guys all have bad old accents - * bad * bad old accents! (Plummer especially! Where * did he learn to do "German"?) And most of them also have bad guys. The innocent bystanders make them too panicky to make you laugh. The good guy survives, among other things: * A 5 "throw knife buried deep in his shoulder - just pull it out and seconds later use the arm effortlessly; * marines' machine gun fire (I think someone is referring to a. 50) in the bone he sortes out by a bandage to secure his leg and then he barely has a limb; * several fist fights in which he maintains various bumps on the face, as well as cranium in a door frame; * a falls backwards from what looks like the third floor, on paving, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other kind of discomfort.The writing has exactly 3 smart lines, the rest of the time it is so boring and boring. /> <br /> OK, it's not bad, Plummer brings a certain class off his side, and this is undoubtedly the best actor in this movie, but of course not much, but he can do the rogue without to apply the ham techniques Most of the villains use here Deliver his "ve haff vays and meance" type of lines with some threat, but you're always aware that you're watching Christopher Plummer doing the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The play, as it is, is kind of 70's 007 movies, with a timeline delivery, with Bruce Lee's distinctly fake battle scenes, but it's not as good as a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee movie no. Don't bother.
