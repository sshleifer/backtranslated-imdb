Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) mission is to strike a Middle Eastern oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the Turakistan country run by US interests. Hauser, as Trade Show producer, enables him to reach Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be overhauled, it becomes most annoying. Here it is too much: government, politics, music, war, people not generally accepted by society, and I called "war". And that's what we've got here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare. I still ask why I continue with the DVD. There are so many Cusak family members in it that John Cusak is embarrassed because the family is just there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> Previously, it was a John Cusak movie, while a little was ultimately pretty good in the end. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and manufacturing this mess. Make it what you want. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on in the movie, accompanied by constant firearms, bombs and screams that you really can't focus on or was it the point? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the hit, which has been largely forgotten for the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have a meaningless villain among all the role-players. And, chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don't think so, but you know: the boy ?? girl thing ???? and they need something to take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, what they were supposed to be (boring and annoying) was the performances of Duff and Kingsley. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character at the start of the show, sat down on a toilet, I knew that the rest of the show was going to the tank as well. I wasn't wrong. I'm sure some will praise this effort, but if a rose is another rose with any other name, it's also a mess. remember why I continued with the DVD. I was hoping the story would somehow flow out and save itself. Never did. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Necessity: No. Language: Yes.
