There is a big difference between the release of an original, intense, edge of your seat, scary, gore-fest, and like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team, he did with "Cabin Fever" and acted just like that. The film follows five college graduates in a bush cabin that is fatally proven, one after the other, to admit to this mysterious, fast-acting, carnivorous disease. It is not long before the friends turn on each other and can barely see each other's eyes, much less in the same environment than they are. So gross as it all sounds, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that worked, in the hands of a less crap movie maker. Unfortunately, what we are ultimately, poorly drawn characters whose only purpose is to look beautiful in the beginning, to make the inevitable dissolution more contrasting, a chopped script so troublesome to leave the dialogue and some incomprehensible subplots little more than (in one case) motivate is a screen appearance by director Roth. It's messy movie making in different ways! Avoid this time waster.
