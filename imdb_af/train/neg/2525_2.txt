This film was, as Homer Simpson put it, "more boring than the church." Maybe I don't understand it well enough, and I thought it started well, but after (STARTING SPOILER) Hermann Braun was sent to jail and Maria started working / sleeping with her boss. It just started dragging and I struggled. to stay awake. Again, it might symbolize something, but the explosion at the end was very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). Eventually, I can't see why others think it's so good, because I found it very boring. By the way, I didn't see this movie by my own free will, as I had to see it for a movie class.
