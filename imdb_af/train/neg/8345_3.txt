This movie could have been so much better, especially in the light of the talent. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He did not synchronize his lips well and his stage methods were Larenz Tate when he had to be Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of women as a bunch of gold diggers wrote to Hollywood about it. The forces that pushed it of course, but it just made the characters more unrealistic. The positive of the movie was Miguel Nunez's portrayal of Little Richard, and the comedy of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is an eyecatcher, as usual, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox's talents were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this movie was a wasteful opportunity.
