They changed the title of this cruelty to an unexpected love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script contains dialogue that will be laughed from a third-degree game review. At one stage when the woman leaves the man, a bad cover from All at Myself plays over the soundtrack! Seriously. The actors try, but are defeated by the unclear, incredibly terrible writing. Direction is staggeringly bad. No wonder Life has such a bad reputation. How to make things like this. I turn the television off before it's over!
