A smile, greetings, is a pathetic comedy that doesn't really make sense. I don't mean the story was complicated, but the whole plot is based on one thing: a couple's desperate and costly unsuccessful attempts to conceive children. People who have tried so hard should not be forgotten about the option of adopting this movie. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a complete contradiction with anything the woman's liberation movement offers. , virtually no sense of independence. She is a very boring character than the dreamy housewife, with nothing but having her, but having children. Like a stupid 50's romance comedy, Greg Kinnear is her husband who also shows no personality, no independence, and any of us. <br /> <br /> They are the two most boring and often annoying characters, and they barely make up for topics of a comedy that have to deal with many accidents, arising from a few who do everything to conceive . Besides, they really do nothing except to a fertility clinic and spend a lot of money doing what they can do in the privacy of their own (except the in vitro fertilization number). The plot makes virtually no inconvenience possible, because, the couple do nothing to create any bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. Approximately? <br /> <br /> The subplots are meant to test the fidelity of the couple, an essential moral element of the story, as the couple plans to conceive children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend (played by Joan Cusak), and they are in the process of developing aphrodisiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays the interested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a great prize for her and her friend's product. The subplot hardly interests you (although Joan Cusak is quite funny in the restaurants). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect who has the opportunity to earn extra money to take the clinic accounts, by a job in Seattle, where his boss is the murderer (another hopeless, helpless female character trying to influence Danny (as silly as he is) to have a relationship with her, when things are conveniently stony with him and his wife (for reasons I don't give away) . Jill Hennesy is good at the role, but her character is too predictable and formulated as an essential element to create conflict for Danny. This is stupid and again, hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> The overall movie itself is completely boring, and almost funny (except the restaraunt scene and the plane flight). The plot offers nothing that really attention. Even if the story was about two people trying to conceive, the authors had discovered several hilarious accidents to develop. Secondly, the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silhouettes of stupid 1950's comedies with a happy woman and clueless man. So, even without accidents occurring in the plot, the characters offer nothing interesting, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusak had to be in the offing and someone else had to take Kinnear's part. Cusak would have even made a bad story surprisingly funny (as she sometimes plays in her co-starring role). It is definitely one to succeed.
