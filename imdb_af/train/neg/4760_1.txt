This reworking of Anthony Shaffer's classic play did not last long in theater. After recently dragging along the cable, I still congratulate myself on not wasting money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star / producer Jude Law have deceived themselves that their prestige can only maintain this transvestite by an interminant 93 minutes without the fun or class of the longer original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine strengthens his reputation as the second lead in the wonderful 1972 movie. He now looks to destroy it by trying to play the head, in this version played by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Oscar for best actors, but lost to Marlon Brando in the Godfather.) Looking for puffy and washed out, Caine slips through the section with less depth than he does as Batman's butler. He has already dropped him off in the horrifying re-recording of GET CARTER. What are the next - ALFIE II, or SON OF MAN WHO WILL BE KING? <br /> <br /> But no one benefits from this inability adjustment by Pinter, who thinks that regular curses and an extra sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's witty character play. Branagh's direction is based on blue lighting and a sleek set design that won't be in a two-day nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight, crowded close-ups can help overcome his dim screen persona. The result is a failure, as well as a direct drama and as a thriller, and almost make you the goal behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and the Olivier / Caine film will do well to consider this venture as a bad dream. The late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must be in his grave and wish he could plan a real murder or two!
