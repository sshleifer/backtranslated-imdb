Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) killed his child and his wife attacked in a house attack. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him by post traumatic stress. Then Archer confronts himself with a man (Til Schweiger) who is bound and clapped on a chair. He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes. And there is a great variety of tools to help him ... <br /> <br /> Initially, film is interesting (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore), but at least gets thinner and has very unlikely plot rotation and turns. It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked who would actually think of using it any more. How such talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer got involved with the crap like this, is outside me. It gets three stars for the acting, but the stupid plot and really amazing twists make it an attempt to go through.
