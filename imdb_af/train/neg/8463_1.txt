No scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Bekk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give such a budget to make it ... In Belgium, we make ten films that are all priced in Cannes wins. with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director was a graduate in school movie or a cop? <br /> <br /> The better things in this movie were the word "End". <br /> <br /> Why authorize it to sell? 1รง is too expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy it. <br /> <br /> To me it was my big mistake of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time I'll break my arm, but buy this type of sh * t.
