Well, the writing was very sloppy, the direction was scruffy, and the editing made it worse (at least I hope it was the editing). The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. Almost none of the characters were nice. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. It was a good idea, but another wasted good idea is over. It could have ended 3 different places, but it just continued to a mostly predictable Hollywood ending. and what was not predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the end was not worth looking at at all. sandra bull was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. The movie also looks rushed. the movie was just not really to be seen, and if i paid for it, i would be very angry. Maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a very good movie and had a bad one. the movie about everything was not terribly bad, but i would not recommend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c, I liked the idea so much and I had one character (only I believe, the super smart). and it also has some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it wasn't nice. Anyway, if you see it, wait for the $ 1.50 theater or video, unless you almost love every movie you see, then I think you'll love this one.
