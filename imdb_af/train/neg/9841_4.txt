I really wanted Julian Po. I think Slater is underestimated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are in this movie. I realize it's based on a short story I didn't read. So, I don't know if I see if the film's mistakes came with the story, or it was imposed by the director / screenwriter. The point of departure is wonderful, and I stole the voting rights, confession of the opening narrative. But then ...? Nothing! Several of the cleaved local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One can argue that he does not answer, because that is not one of their issues. But Julian is the one who, under pressure, flushed his intentions publicly. Then, neither Julian, nor the director / writer, despite the fact that the Julian character remembers a record for God's sake, seems likely to provide anything beyond the scant initial information about Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family was walking when he was a child because of his father's work. Approximately? There are several interactions with the local population that seem to be Julian's aim to relieve. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian looks like all these dull locals as if they were strangers from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) healthy one among them. It can work as an allegory, if Julian Po has any definition traits, or something that brings forth wisdom. The closest he comes to reveal anything about himself is in the scene in which he deliberately humiliates the mechanic's na√Øve wife. And what this scene reveals is nothing that will inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character - as rendered - as selfish, small, and completely condescending. Similar to the attitude of the director of this half-baked, confronted film. And armor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise, gets nothing to do with working together.
