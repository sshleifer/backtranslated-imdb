Please, be warned: this movie, although a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most horrible movies I saw ... EVER. Just remember that before you sit down on your sofa to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So start with a party. Just your average party, but there's a guy there. He's beautiful in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Memorize his face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Kate George will find Clooney (didn't I say the plot is bad?) and so take the tube. It's in the middle of the night underground in London, but she's just as stupid. So the grid says the following, and last the train will come in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, stupid party girl she is, decides she can have a nap in the free 7 minutes. She typically misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Only. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie is just from there. Blood, intestines, limbs, even certain parts of the body I will not call are cut off and chopped and eventually amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a typical horror; nice but thick girl in emergency-type women and sick, strange psycho. Or, as the case may be, Creep. <br /> <br /> I want to say, give it a go if you're in Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, scream with satisfaction. Horror must thank you.
