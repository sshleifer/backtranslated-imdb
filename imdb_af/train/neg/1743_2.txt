Contrary to its title, this film offers no spices and is therefore subject to a tasteless dish. All Humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, educated, reminiscent of those Pakistani plays on video available, including even the ways. Everyone screams, shouts and does strange things for no reason. The look is interesting, as it is a straight lift from Hollywood's Boeing Boeing. John Abraham, who is so natural in all his films, is a complete misfit here. If we keep aside the morality factor, the bizarre events look even at the same time. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts, are trying hard to lift the film by being, of course, in vain. At least the three girls' characters must be made contrasting to bring interesting elements, but unfortunately they also seem to be brainless. Speaking, acting and even shouting bobbles (3Bs). The main hole in the plot is what made the main character to keep the three girls at the same house as if they would never get to know each other? To do some sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore, so many drama bazi are not something that the audience will easily digest for no reason. But surely, great meat shows and seductive promotions always give you movies is a good start. For those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor from such a cinema audience is surely corrupted and demented to the extent that they commit to a sadistic, strange and crazy kind of humor, where it is not the characters they laugh at, but rather themselves and on theirs own frustrations that seem to have become so insane that we can laugh at such things to laugh?
