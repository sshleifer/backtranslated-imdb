Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on the Elm Street series and again a bad sequel. I think it's tied up with the last successor of the Dream Child. I was fortunate to get the Nightmare on the Elm Street series DVD set for my birthday so I got all the prosecutions. May I say that I am increasingly disappointed with these successors, at least the last two, Freddy seems to have lost his rand. It's almost like the authors try to give Freddy a soul and they just destroy it instead of rediscovering the story. It was a follow-up that was not necessary, sorry for Robert Englund, but it was much below what Freddy Krueger represented. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but he has something we don't know, a daughter. Maggie, she is not aware that he is her father, but soon finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants to help her. She must do her best to resist his strength, but it is difficult with all the good memories she has of her lovely father. Ekronies, isn't it? But Freddy didn't give up without manipulating her in his ways. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Watch the sarcasm. It's one of the worst successors, it's tied with the fifth successor to the Nightmare on the Elm Street series. I'd rather see the second nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. It only had bad acting, stupid editing and just a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept of it and it just the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger was really devastated, the death master of nightmares, not Father knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
