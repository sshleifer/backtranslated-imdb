Unlike my principles, let me first make a conclusion, because I only saw this piece of art and still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and I will never bother to write a single word about it, if not for the fact that "44 minutes" made me sick to death , that seldom happens to me. The fact that I paid for it doesn't really make me better, as well as the fact that the movie has earned the high user rating here. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". The first one thinks of "15 minutes", which is incidentally a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and the two can indeed be compared. But, as luck would have, the things they share are their worst traits. They both have Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who, with his strong Russian accent, naturally meets the popular expectations and prejudices. His aim is to appeal to the Cold War mind. Oh, we miss the good old times. Now I do not imply that he is a bad actor, but to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual, he is more like an archetype. How anyone can still enjoy such things is completely beyond my understanding. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. The point in the film when Taktarov explains to his companion that the Romans are not Germans, and that they are in America, is really laughable. Must we accept that the greatest desire of the miserable duo is to become true Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there's the media edition. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director had to make us feel the rhythm of the supposed 44 minutes. Instead, he entertains us with interviews throughout the movie as in a cheap TV program, which tries to rediscover the wheel. In 15 minutes, the issue of the media is the central one. The point is presented in a way that a teacher addresses a blunt student, but it deserves a separate comment. We are now focusing on 44 minutes. So, I tried to identify the purpose of this movie. What is it? To provide good time for the audience? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Reflecting on violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the minor criminal. So must it promote peace and understanding? I don't think so, but don't ask me. I just know I didn't enjoy these things. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit I'm a big fan. I was hoping he would be a bright point, but I went wrong. However, this is not his fault. <br /> <br /> As the final note, it was one or the worst lines I've ever heard, to compare "firepower" to "willpower" at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> To sum up, on Scale 1-10, I give it a pure, inexorable one.
