This movie looks completely useless. There is no reason why anything that happens to it, as if written by a small child half-bored and thought "how can I upload it?". And what was Jared Harris and Christopher Walken thinking? Did they do it for a bet? I couldn't tell you the plot, I'm not quite sure there is one to be honest, but if it is, it didn't register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland when she falls under the stairs as they jab, as you do. They went to a house with a very annoying little girl in it, met Christopher Walken who dug an old old woman in custody. He brings her back to nothing but the story continues, and she shows her gratitude by immediately decorating him. From then on it becomes a bit stupid. A few hours of my life I would like!
