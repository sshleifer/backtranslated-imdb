"This story is dedicated to women," said the introduction, "who has been fighting the loose-leaf system since Adam and Eve." When "Politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, which was the right to vote for women, was only a decade old. And the film deals with the use of political power by women as a voting group. A ban on the ban and the conclusion of speakeasies was a major concern for women at that time. <br /> <br /> Good scenery Marie Dressler (like Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after a young woman is shot dead and killed. from a speakeasy. She wants the liquor sales joints closed; and set up in a Mayor run after a powerful speech at a women's rally. Me. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (like Peter Higgins). Dressler's Mayor of Lake City draws opposition from men in town; So, Dressler ordered the women to strike, deny them, "everything" in the "salon, bedroom and bath." <br /> <br /> The movie sounds much better than it turned out. The humor, honestly, is not too good; and it contains some unknown and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to an Amos and Andy character). And the blending of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well, this time. Producers could consider making the movie more dramatic, exclusively on Dressler and the characters William Bakewell (such as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns) played. <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
