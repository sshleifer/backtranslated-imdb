I knew it would be, but I gave it a hassle for a few laughs and maybe a little meaningful fun. Anyone who has read some of my reviews can see that I am pretty easy to please. I really didn't think I'd feel negative about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is about an old army of dragons led by a big snake that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can? become one with ?? a good dragon ?? or something ?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I didn't bother to do much to keep it. <br /> <br /> It features a very dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts. So many of the events just felt completely random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I suppose there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story looks like it's so big and epic, but everything happens so fast and go through so fast. I feel like I have only been hit with one million plot points and action rows in one big ball. The film is like a punch in the face. It doesn't take much time to draw characters or drama. Imagine the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings in 90 minutes? You can have most of the epic battle order, but there will be absolutely no buildup and you will hardly care about the outcome of that battle. This was the case with Dragon Wars ?? 90 minutes from me don't give a shit and wait for it to be over. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with some good directing, but horrible acting, fast pacing and dumb story made it very difficult to enjoy on any terrain. I would probably have loved it when I was 6.
