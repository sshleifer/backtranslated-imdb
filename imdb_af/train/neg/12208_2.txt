As an army veteran, I was deeply insulted by this movie. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offensive to this shit is an understatement. If the movie is presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But it's taken seriously many people, especially overseas. Foolish as it sounds, after which I went to Europe in the late 80's, people generally judged me and Americans through this movie. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's look. A monosillabic, muscle bound cheat is being pulled from a prison gang to go to SE Asia to free some US POWs on a secret mission. In a running battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammunition and never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held with one arm. I could go on, but I have a headache. I only gave it 2/10 because it is slightly better than Rambo III.
