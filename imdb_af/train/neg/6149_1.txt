I will spend a few days at Ron Howard before I completely abolish his work. Unfortunately, after dealing with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is caught up in so many Lucas traits. How else do you explain its disasters? Of course, his only useful movie is 'Willow'. Everything else, including this one, is too dependent on superficial junk. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can't even focus semi-intelligently like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard stuck to his Spielberg's knockoff qualities that he would soon forget. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old adage: "love conquers everything, even the disease." It's a pity for Howard that Lynch got more and more skills throughout the subtitle. Heck, even Disney did better than that. Ron even discusses the possibilities offered by imagined realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's commentary is just awful. Don't even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud
