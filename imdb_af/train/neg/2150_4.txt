You will immediately recognize the plot. Girls from a divorced couple are trying to get their mother and father together again. Yes, it was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60's, 80's and 90's. But here's the haunting thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills while playing the doting girl roles, Durbin looks much older, as in the adult. And so do all her so-called brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child goes through the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits, but look ridiculous in them, as the director suffers from showing off their spaces and interludes throughout the film. So you are constantly torn to think of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start hitting on them, you feel like they're pedophiles, and you can also be one to notice those guys and tops pointing to the director. Teens or tempting, little girls or little foxes, you're never quite sure what to think of them. <br /> <br /> The parents also look very old and the whole movie looks very dated. <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of the Staircase and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.
