If it wasn't for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the unspoken stoners, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot centers around a 10-year high school reunion, which takes place in a supposed high school (looks more like a backing of a low budget cricket of the 1950s), and the qualified student , the class, had a very traumatic prank. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters too, as only one student is murdered as well as the lunch lady (Goies Anne Ramsey). We are led to believe that the horny linked are killed, but never see an exploded thing! It is a terrible movie that continues the National Lampoon's negligent spiral throughout the 80s and 90s.
