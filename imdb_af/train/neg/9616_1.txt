First of all, I had my doubts about just watching the DVD box and reading it and saying it was a lot of teenagers coming to a lake where they got something. Any movie that has such a performance failed, even as a treasure movie, except for the first Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just thought it should get a little better. It didn't. Usually I think every movie has something you can take from it. It has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself paper cuts, or eat dirty.
