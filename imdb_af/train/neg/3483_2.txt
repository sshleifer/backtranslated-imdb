Survival Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. With his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie doesn't want to be left alone at Christmas, so he decides to return to his youth home. He sets up the dysfunctional family who now lives and bribes there as his family. An obnoxious and one-dimensional display by Affleck, which deals mainly with a flashing smile, makes its character a mentally unbalanced crawl, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe a little into this mess. Even for farce, his folly is asleep, not much from scene to scene, and his sentimental messages are as filthy as Affleck's grin. 91 min., Graded PG-13. * Â½
