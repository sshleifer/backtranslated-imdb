*** One Out of Ten Stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it was, it got a F. Holy Mother Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave it every reasonable accommodation because it was a straight film video, but it dropped me every turn. Like so many other B movies, the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers had a fair amount of resources, but the performance was ridiculous. It is a pity that they have attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise surrounds some frat shower bags offering their annual Halloween haunted house fundraiser, when a satanic playbook comes out of nowhere and throws the freak boys into a living hell. Well, that is the idea anyway, but most of the films are dedicated to the performance of this frat's relationship flights, in abundance with an outrageous lesbian subplot. Very little of the real story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious book. It actually hurts me that the filmmakers thought they could get away with such dribbles. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially about frat boy relationships. This is NOT where the movie is billed as. I am requested to locate the producers and at least threaten them with bodily harm. The acting is about as bad as it gets, it's scary! The writing is inadvertently funny. The cinematography is just lazy. The whole movie is amateur night. This movie actually makes the SyFy channel movie productions such as masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie felt that the filmmakers realized they hadn't made a soap opera and somehow had to throw horror rows. The evil game book finally comes into play and turns everyone into the haunted house in the character they drew. I almost feel like crying if I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was a thoughtless, chopped disaster.
