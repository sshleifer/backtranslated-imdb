Leave it to Paul "sex on the brain" Verhoeven to make an unrelenting and youthful version of the Unknown Man story. If he directs a Pok√©mon movie, he is sure he will turn it into a massive orgy of all sorts. I don't care for sex or even sleaze (watch my other reviews) on film, but frankly, it's clear the director has a one-track thought and he couldn't see interesting aspects of an invisible man's tale as the kinky implications that goes with it. . This is a pity, as it could have been good if the movie didn't spend much time with an invisible Kevin Bacon woman. <br /> <br /> The spell of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who was totally wasted here. <br /> <br /> But then, what did I expect from the SHOWGIRLS director, what, VAT, is much more entertaining than this stilted & bath movie.
