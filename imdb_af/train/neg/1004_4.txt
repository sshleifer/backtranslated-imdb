Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (like Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is surprised when a court soldier announces "thank you" to the witness officer, LL Cool J (as Rafe actor), leaving the witness leave. The explanation is given in the opening series of this film. You will see Mr. Cool J's devious detective partner Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decides not to kill Damien Dante Wayans (like Isaiah Charles). The policemen in the city of Edison are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and sniff their drop. Whether he wants to impress his girlfriend or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption is NOT good with the noble Mr. Timberlake not. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption that reaches both unexpected levels and life-threatening levels of danger. Author / director David J. Burke keeps the film above water, but only scarce. LL Cool J hits Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" sweep (also known as the "rapper to actor" progression). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. Gravitas lending for the proceedings is soft supporting actors Morgan Freeman (such as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who are lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
