The Night of the Prom: The most important night for any level girl is almost plastic. And so the characters reminded us every ten minutes when the trivial lives of a spectacular minute happen. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for Prom Night. There was less than nothing original about it and I would have given it really zero or less stars if it was possible on IMDb. The only part of my performance that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a ghost game. It was much more exciting than what happened on the screen before they happened. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically a guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Perhaps if the man was a little frightening rather than an easy-going Robbie Williams look-alike with a baseball cap, I might have been a little anxious there. The fact that I looked less at the characters I did about the color of the theater mat didn't really contribute either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and unaware. The hotel staff apparently did not notice that one of their maids had disappeared and was further proof that a murderer was unrecognizable after having had a shave. I was very surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to see who he was. She realized this and then went on to fall down the stairs, trapped herself in a plastic sheet and then knocked over a heap of paint pans. Nice one. <br /> <br /> The worst was, I believe, the director is trying his utmost hardest. He pushed all the boundaries completely by not showing deadly deeds. Shocking! And the music doesn't even get me started. It was almost as fitting as a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really wish Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and silly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this movie. Mainstream theater seems to go down and movies like this aggravate the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely horrible movie, hear my plea. Don't do this. There are better things to spend six pounds. Like a sheet to play spokes.
