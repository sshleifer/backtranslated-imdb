I just watched the amazing melting man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first looked at it. I don't understand why it has become such a cult classic if it's so boring. The open scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the blood tube and runs for her dear life. After all this really happens to melt man stalks around some bushes and homes, while having as an astronaut flashbacks of his life. The makeup is pretty good, and its melting face looks pretty realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a man's head into a river, and drives it until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. There isn't much to leave yourself, but most scenes are shot in the dark and you can't really see what happens. There isn't much gore, at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. <br /> <br /> No, the incredibly melting man is not that good at all. I'll give it points for the cheese factor, but it's about it. If you want a TRUE sci-fi / horror cult classic, watch the Deadly Spawn instead!
