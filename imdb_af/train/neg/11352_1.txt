This is what you would get if you allowed a 10-year-old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Perhaps it has a little fascinated in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it didn't matter to make half an hour worthwhile. Save your time and money and look at BOLT <br /> <br /> Damn. Not enough lines, but I feel it does it. Well, I agree with a review above - it's like a propaganda story of the Cold War. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they made it over the flies that exposed the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies were dead in the first minute. VAT - why were all the main characters deformed? No one had the full compliment of limbs!
