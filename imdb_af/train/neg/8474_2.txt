The opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velvet. The attempted dramatic dialogue only allowed me to have better control over the quick forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or very disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. I usually count a body number, so there was a cat (not counting) a baby, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword (whatever it was) and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound to bite an apple to assist a vampire in a victim is simply stupid. I love Warlock, but this movie looks just so bad we turned it off, and it was so forgotten that we rented it a year later to just shut it down.
