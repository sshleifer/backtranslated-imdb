From reading all the comments posted on IMDb, this movie looks a lot, but I didn't think it was that bad. I've seen much worse. <br /> <br /> "The home where evil lives" is a ghost story about a man and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who is in an old home in Japan. Little do they know, a Japanese ninja cruelly killed his wife and her lover, killing him 100 years earlier with a Samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghost of the previous residents begins to possess the bodies of life and plans to reinvent the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, the cover looks like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was wheat-like, but I got worse in my day. The ghost sequence was a bit over, we saw the translucent blue figures randomly appearing randomly across the family, and taking over their bodies. To be honest, the spirits in this movie kind of remind me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. I can be mistaken, but after that it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of the movie ripped it a bit. The old Japanese house where a brutal murder took place, haunted ghost activities, curses on the house, etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, it's a nice, funny ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this thing and it happens on TV, you can give it a shot. 10/04.
