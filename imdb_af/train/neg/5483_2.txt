I just rented four dollars to rent this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a movie is beyond me. But even more surprising were the fairly good reviews some Canadian newspaper critics gave this movie. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian and low budget. It's as if they expect the Canadian movies to be nice, so they give it a good review, regardless. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: The acting was below average (with the exception of the main male character, which was actually quite good). The quality of the film was poor, which I think can be expected from the extremely low budget. The writing was absolutely terrible. An example is the story that revolves around one of the main characters, a female drug dealer, who thrives with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to find and steal bicycles for her gang. The only purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs. Many of her gang members are presumably destroyed in these activities (I don't know how she can afford to buy only new ones, as she has to be this great drug connection from Vancouver to Toronto). <Br /> <br /> Anyway, the point of the story (which is not made far beyond half the film) is that the drug dealer is planning to make buildings in the Toronto area more homes affordable - like no one wants to stay in the area. <br /> <br /> - I have to say more. <br /> <br /> Shame on the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, Telefilm for its support, and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers for giving such bias reviews. <br /> <br /> A movie shouldn't get special treatment just because it's Canadian !!
