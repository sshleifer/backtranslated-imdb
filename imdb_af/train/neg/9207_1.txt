This movie is sold at Wal-Mart on a DVD for one dollar and so I don't feel that I have lost anything to watch this movie except my time. Enjoy the play by Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and gave an excellent performance as it was a terrible writing. The story is about students who have decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, just in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has experienced problems with other colleges in the past and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic flight with her and once he starts playing the game, he stops loving her and acts like a monk. There are a few scenes in the film being performed around the former World Trade Center and also in the Observation floor and Roof area. It is quite sad to see this part of the movie where so many people have died because of evil in the world. It's not a very good movie, except that Tom Hanks is trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment.
