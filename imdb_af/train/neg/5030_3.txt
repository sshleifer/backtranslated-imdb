What's up in the air? Is this a plane? Is it Superman ?? Errr, no ?? It's a TURTEL!?! Look, that's what the Cold War does! Nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans shoot somewhere a Russian fighter plane over the Artistic territory and thaw the subsequent explosion and literally awaken the giant prehistoric tortoise creature called Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly guy, as it immediately destroys everything and everyone on his way. The ruling governments eventually decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in the store? The damn turtle can fly! The first time it happens in an amazingly grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera lies on his back and looks defeated when he suddenly blows his armpits, and he blows himself into the air. How can you not love it? Then there's a dull subplot about an annoying child who can communicate telepathically with the monster, but that's just not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is very little to write about this Japanese (and American refurbished) scientific effort, apart from being a clear and completely shameless rip-off of such classics as the original Godzilla and the Beast out of 20,000 Vathes. The effects and sample designs are extremely hokey and, unlike the aforementioned films, they never succeed in creating an apocalyptic atmosphere. Respective actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") are unaware of what movie show they are on and even the original Japanese outburst screens are not very convincing. Gammera's own and personal theme song is pretty cool, but it gets one extra point for it.
