Who did the research for this movie? It was in Baghdad in 2004, but all the soldiers carry ACUs and have all the Universal Camouflage Pattern equipment. No one wore those things in 04. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie while it was deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming sense of the audience was WTF? This movie did not make sense, characters come without explanation, and people do ridiculous things that will never happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but of course it tries to portray something realistic. It fails, but it tries. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone has gotten a bunch of random ideas, chewed them and swallowed them and then wiped out a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm not sure why I put the whole thing through. GI Joe was one that really made you think about this. STAY AWAY!
