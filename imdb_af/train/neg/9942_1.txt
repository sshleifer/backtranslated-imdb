At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the popcorn as hard as possible to drown the inferior dialogue. It is absolutely not a girl picture. Any blocks that like it is the one our ladies can surely stay far away from. Mute story, mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap movie. I have seen many, many movies, but this one is the new winner in the bad category. If you see it, the one thing you will look forward to is the end. So you can run from the theater as soon as possible.
