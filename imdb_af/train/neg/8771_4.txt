All right, I was bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the most important thing that brought this movie was that there would be an hour of footage, and basically the same time four times the same time. It consists of 1. The troops gather and discuss the attack plan. 2. Flashbacks to the men's wives. 3. The troops' approach in a long line. 4. Men who shoot and shoot on the hill, usually the first to be shot in the head. then three other men save him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call to base the story of success. 6. Men looking back at women and singing 10 minutes songs. It was the basic movie, and the same sequence of events happened about 4 or 5 times. And every time it made a blow to the women, it would show the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a jump back, so it took a lot of time. Other than that, the men could not kill their enemy except with bayonets or grenades. I like the music and there was a lot of action, though the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably won't see it again, but it wasn't too terrible.
