Number murder is one of those movies you expected to be made for TV, but it's not. Due to the only actor of any note, Bullock (although Michael Pitt looks at bigger and better things), is not a big surprise that this movie quickly disappears from memory to be replaced by more important things. Like ... remember to close your front door when you go out. Or to put on clothes again when you come out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a policeman with personal problems (not all). Together with her new partner (a wet look Ben Chaplin) she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except the perps are a few teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills between Cassie and the chief suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling) is emerging. <br /> <br /> The paralyzing problem here is that the two leaders are hopeless. Bullock, although very beautiful to look at, is about as credible in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield (actually he would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least, Gosling and Pitt, as the shaky suspected suspects, freed themselves sufficiently. As if dodgy leaders were not bad enough, a story that would make someone sleep and make a highly predictable (but illogical) end, this movie shoots in the head before it has a chance to run. <br /> <br /> "Murder With Numbers" has done absolutely nothing about it, even a useless naked scene by Bullock will not leave it. Well, just a little bit, but still not enough to save it. Forgetful, predictable and redundant - it's a movie that won't move the cop genre forward. As Cassie probably says in her next case, there's nothing to see people here. Stay along, keep moving ...
