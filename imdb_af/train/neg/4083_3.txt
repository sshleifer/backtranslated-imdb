I saw this movie when it was released, and my dislike for it has been sticking to me for years. <br /> <br /> That's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal is to take every literary image into the Tempest and make it literally. If a character were to say, "My heart is fleeing," we would be shown a real human heart, with pigeon wings attached, slamming across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes for lush lush tableaux, but ultimately it's a healthy exercise. And it gets deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the pleasure that other viewers have found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience is surprised.
