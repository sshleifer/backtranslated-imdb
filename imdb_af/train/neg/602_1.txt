Another example of the complete waste of British lottery money. How commercially this film proved. The Film Council, which funded this unfortunate rubbish, has to be stranded on one of London's underground stations, as it makes the clich√©d, a foolish monster dedicated to film, a half-mutant thing consisting of all the horror movies the director saw. and feel fit to imitate, especially Deathline. Among his many sins, the fairly obvious failure to make the main character to the last minute is extremely sympathetic. It's a little too late then! Certainly, all the development managers at the British Film Council could have seen it at the stage of writing. Add to that the horrible acting and the ridiculous appearance of the creature and you get an excellent example of how not to be scared.
