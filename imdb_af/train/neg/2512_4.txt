Tim Robbins is strangely good here, throwing a car mechanic in the 1950s New Jersey falling in love with a shining blonde who apparently is Albert Einstein's cousin! Although much of the time on the screen, Robbins cancels the inner working of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Some romantic comedy with a gimmick, it's Walter Matthau who plays Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoon witness). Otherwise, it is struggling and sunny, targeted, sleepy by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no white or brain. Meg Ryan is her usual sweet self and the chemistry between her and Robbins is beautiful, like that of a loving sister and her big brother. ** of ****
