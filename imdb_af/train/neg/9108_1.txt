This so-called prequel is just a bad remake for a better version of Dangerous Lungs. The plots are identical to most of the writing. I loved the book, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to struggle with the 3rd movie. The relentless trigger between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and untouchable, and ... I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says "If you like the first one, you'll have the second one." The only reason is because it's the exact same movie! Although the plot is not even that good. They took so many lines from the first movie. It's hard to see what movie you're watching.
