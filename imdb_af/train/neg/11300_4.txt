1st Looked 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The 3rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result of the viewer's perspective. The story is similar and the results are high. This time, the location of the story, as the Egyptian priest's new follower, sends a mummy to our country, hoping to revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not being asked to do much for this character). The new priest becomes a mortuary in the village and sends out the mummy to do his dirty acts after he has given him the tannic juice. Once again, a girl gets in the way, as the priest falls for one of the descendants' fianc√© and wants her, yes --- to be immortal with him (haven't we heard it yet?). The plan is obviously weakened if the townspeople with the torches with the torches (similar to the Frankenstein monster) hunt and the burning of the creature ends the story ... how do they get a sequel? I think you will find out with the next one in the series ?? or not .....
