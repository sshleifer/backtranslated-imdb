Although the film takes place at an "Ivy League" college, it was actually shot in Northern Arizona, mostly at the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater section there and most of the extras In the film are then members of the theater section. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely ridiculous scene in this movie (if you know your Arizona geography), which shows several members of college movie bikes to a creek. We know that the campus and the creek (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles apart, and while the trip is down, it will literally NOT be possible to drive a bike back on the same road!
