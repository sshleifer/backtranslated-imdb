Oh man, bite this movie ever! If you were ever scared to see a slash of the slasher genre, done as cheaply as possible and so carefully at the same time (computer friendly, no nudity means a classic element of slasher movies). Cut it. Every click is rectified without an indication of self-awareness and the acting. Oh, the scene redefines the word horror. I needed to know better, because the direct Dutch translation of the title would have cut me off.
