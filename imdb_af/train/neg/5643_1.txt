I own 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad it forced me to register and comment on it. How bad was that? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola earned an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande's in this movie. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. Her lover died just one month before her arrival at the Rubber House he gave her. As soon as she discovered, he cheated on her by her fianc√©, but nothing seemed to register with her. Within a day she started a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the caretaker of the house. Even though she was married to Dafoe's screen, her screens were cold and emotional. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe can beat this movie from the amateur movie.
