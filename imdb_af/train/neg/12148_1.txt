Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie an 8.1 score? I think the people who actually made or died in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. I am a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but here was nothing literally here. The story and acting were the worst I have ever seen. The props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. I'm all for a bad language in movies, but the F-bomb has fallen over every third word and I think we can ever have a winner for the most use of the F-bomb in any movie. The film also appears to be filmed using cheap video cameras and not real film. I expect it will receive awards for an amateur movie that is only displayed on public access stations across the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. It is valuable time that you will never come back. Unfortunately for me that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider my warning.
