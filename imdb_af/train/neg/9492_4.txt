One star for the "plot". One star for the play. One star for doubling in the squeaky-spoken Americans. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their tendency to take off all their clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Beart, two years before she made 'Manon des sources'. BÃ©art also pulls out a few times, but even at her presence, it is enough to make this film equally viewable. Beware of the scene where she tells her girlfriend about the three "first time" for a girl. It is slick, but still much more erotic than the rather choreographed "love stories" with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, the movies are not big; The silence for the closing credits is a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
