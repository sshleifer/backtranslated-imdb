I am a current A.S.L. Student and was forced to watch this movie in class, and what I got from it was the blatant prejudice involved in the film. The film is naturally leaning on P.O.V. Of the "general deaf perception" they are not a middle ground. Also, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also discussed in this topic. That is, Deaf People who have been heard and later become deaf. Is that right or wrong in that case? The film is biased and virtually everything according to the Deaf with a capital "D". Not that it is bad, but that it must be a true documentary film, should try to be a bit unbiased.
