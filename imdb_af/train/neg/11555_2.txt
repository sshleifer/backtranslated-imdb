A big slasher movie - too bad, it was the producers and not part of the screenplay. Basic Plot Summary - A man with a redhead fetish just goes to such women just to go to some freakish coma and continue to bring them to different degrees of success. Only the cutting staff behind the scenes had thought the movie was such an advertisement as I did and cut the shit out of the movie. Nothing flows, you get lost on what redhead he is at the time (didn't he earlier?) And most of the time the camera man seems to have gone out and resumed to film when he wakes up. Not that I could blame him, I passed 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume trying to recover the small plot that exists. Warning when you see the end, don't try to link it to anything that happened before - you'll just get an aneurysm. Not the time, worth it, or God forbids money. Just a reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the slight chance of hacking happening between movie loss and the horrible version I watched.
