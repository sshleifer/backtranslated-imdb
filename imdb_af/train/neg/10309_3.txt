"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolute horrible rip off of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The movie is basically about a woman being captured and trained by the CIA and forced to do a secret mission for them. (Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson may be the worst in theater history. Lamas's "acting" is merely a bad Steven Segal imitation. Performing Orenthal in this movie is a turbulent experience. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting are sometimes poor in this movie. It is sometimes nice. There are so many action movies in the movie that are ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, poor ponies, etc. The musical score looks like David Michael Frank's score for Hard to Kill (1990), which promotes the Steven Segal theme of this movie. There is a lot of martial arts in the movie, and it's done pretty well for a low budget US production. The sensible action and about the top acting never stopped, and I must admit I was generously entertained. <br /> <br /> In the early 90's, Lorenzo Lamas regained the appearance of an action star, but he is definitely not an action star. That's why he does soap operas and not action block busters. My recommendation is that you hit "CIA Codename: Alexa" and look "La Femme Nikita" instead.
