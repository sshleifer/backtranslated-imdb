It's a very confusing movie. The movie is very difficult to follow and the plot doesn't seem meaningful. The wrath of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when a movie is baptized from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was intended. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but I doubt it can count on all the problems with this movie. The dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't fit well with the characters. The screens are sloppy, there are a variety of strange and irrelevant characters who do little more than the viewer even more confused. What I had about this movie was the appearance of the wolfman himself and the screens he was attacking. Now if they could put it all together and make it meaningful, they might have had something. Don't waste your time on this one.
