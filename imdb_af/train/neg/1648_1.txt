Personally, while I really appreciate good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy anything, even the crappiest of crap. You know, those times when you just want to sit there watch a horrible cookie cutter action movie to kill time. This is the only movie I can remember, actually in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of going back to completing it. The plot was so predictable and predictable, I asked what the next scene would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at it). The actors were horrible, I performed better in middle school plays. Even the scene cuts were bad, the flow was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that has forgotten the funny.
