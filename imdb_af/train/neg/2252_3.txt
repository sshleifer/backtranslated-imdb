So I heard from a few people that this movie brought them to the tears in the theater. As I watched it for the first time, I expected another romantic, tearful Barbra Streisand movie; Something like the way we were. I was probably wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was inconsistent, making it impossible to hold onto the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell to an alcoholic drug addict who could not sing a single note without letting me hit the quick button. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a dead-end rock star and a woman who can't realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the movie looked as though it was dragging on, and I asked myself when it was going to end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was a clear advance of his reckless behavior in the film well in advance, and when he died, I had no feeling. It wasn't a tragic accident, it was basically an idiot. Not to mention the movie completely, I was distracted by his spectacular beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this movie are worth seeing, the Streisand songs. The end of the movie when she sings "With One More Look At You / Now Look, Now" was my reason to give this movie 3/10. The 7 minutes was the only part of the movie. I actually felt a different emotion than irritation and anger.
