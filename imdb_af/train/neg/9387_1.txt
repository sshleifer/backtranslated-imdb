I saw this movie when it was first released. The memory of how bad it was, stayed with me for almost forty years. I didn't want my own sentiments about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted a movie review the next day in a large metropolitan newspaper. Sentiment confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, impenetrable and uninspiring. A little research shows that producer stars Leslie Caron's husband was, so the nose of nepotism is the beginning of this horrible movie. The movie's roster of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame, and James Sikking among others - suggests that it contains a promise. But the death of this movie is due to his horrible script. The mystery inspected by them is so obscure and so little revealed by the film that the viewer is confused from scene to scene. The movie looks like it's a detective trial and a spy thriller, but never settles on one or the other. The feeling of tension is completely absent. The main characters rely on playing dry, emotional types in a way that inspires no empathy whatsoever. Cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the unlucky viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and eventually the movie itself. I'm not surprised that there isn't a version of this pathetic movie available to buy. I hope that if TCM finds some pressure from this movie and it needs to air it, it's safely dragged to the 4: 00 lock.
