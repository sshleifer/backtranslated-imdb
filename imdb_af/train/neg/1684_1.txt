So is the case with Columbia Pictures' The Grudge. "This film-like cruelty began when another American made a Japanese Japanese TV movie" Ju-on "and was inspired to retrieve the film in English. It launched a virtual tsunami of bad decisions that bypassed the world until it was washed in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise, and I use the word loosely, involves a house in Tokyo run by a Skinny Momma ghost that looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her cruel sidekick a chubby, rambunious but evil second grader. Is there anything scarce than a creepy 8-year-old Japanese boy? Certainly there! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this whimsical bunch we have to add a mysterious black cat that I have lovingly named Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you have already touched, they are murdered in this domicile of punishment and you want to kill anyone entering the premises. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage, they seek revenge on everyone who stretches on the property lines as defined by the commissioner or something, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently with well-known Thespian Bill Pullman who jumps from a balcony after his death. My guess is that Bill Pullman got this job because his children asked him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we endure the gently interesting saga of Nurse Yoko, "Oh no, don't go in there," the audience screams, but unfortunately, she doesn't like the serious warnings and is predictably outputted like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see his American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar could be a skilled actress, but I couldn't help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that it was distracting. This is similar to the fact that Jennifer Anniston is in a movie about the adventures of six New York friends. Try as you please, you just can't stop thinking about the other project that made her known. But I bid farewell, Karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original caretaker who jumped with us. <br /> <br /> Its snoops, ghosts, comedians, and other things meet. I look at the fair harbor vixen looking for clues I expected half of her to find the ghost and pull off his mask to reveal that it was actually old man Gower who owns the deserted amusement park! "I would also get away with it if it wasn't for you to interfere with the children and the dog!" <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who is the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions in terms of sound. First, he chooses to use only a soundtrack when someone dies. It's an excellent design to wipe out any tension because the audience gets a two-minute warning to prepare for another miserable predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a greedy gopher. After the movie I heard that several people were leaving the scene that made the sound and laugh. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends the only survivor. And of course, we learn that the fire she set to burn home is eliminated in time for the next chapter. Due to the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a prosecution, but an excuse. "The Grudge" can easily be processed into a comedy, perhaps it will be appreciated for its camp value. By barring it, it's going to be the biggest movie maker since 'Godzilla vs Megalon.' I suggest waiting until the movie arrives at your local discount theater where it can ridicule the public that so deserves it.
