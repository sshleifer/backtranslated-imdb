This movie was bad to say the least !!! The abundance of wonderful cars is ashamed to be featured in this LAME movie. It starts with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... in a Ferrari F430. I put it in 1HR 50min in a small 4-cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie is not right on these cars. Obviously, these writers are just as likely to drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 hours. I remember seeing the news how Eddie Griffin is going to run a 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest sale! He brings shame to his own race. I just wonder how many people he is orally just breaking into Hollywood. He participated in a film depicting Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women >> cheap money red whores. Asian men >> lose compulsive gamblers and thugs who defeat all the time. What is the fear of all anxiety about Asians? Why should you always portray it in such a negative connotation? I'm so sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS always portrays ASIA in such a negative and false pretense.
