Surely the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful movie attacked by Republicans? Why don't they learn. The Dixie chicks don't. These Lefties live in their own elite bubble interaction between each other; Unaware of the fact that most of America is much more right than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely politics. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's imitation of Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I thought Cussack could have landed better movies. <br /> <br /> It wasn't funny.
