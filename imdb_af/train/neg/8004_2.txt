First of all, let me say the first 20 minutes are good, the monster looks great and the CGI is pretty much done. It is a pity that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment. <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> The opening scene we can see is anti-American. Normally this kind of stereotyping won't bother me (our Brits get enough of Hollywood), but here it is not subtle to make Americans brain-dead morons. It goes beyond the point of realism and your left wondering if Yank raped the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The sad scene was very poor and the part of the movie where it started running. <br /> <br /> Here we are introduced to the Olympic medal Tannie and drunk uncle who walks in the anniversary and starts blaming the father for the death of his daughters and then hitting him before they all start on the floor role. Hardly realistic bonding in a time of crisis! <br /> <br /> The entire virus's margin is ridiculous. If the Americans know there isn't a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources? The American government agent ordered the brain to drill an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look angry (or stupid), not being helped by the fact that this man was cut for the comic effect. <br /> <br /> The movie is about hunting the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to find the creature, though it is invisible by the film. The only people hunting the monster throughout Korea are the main family and some random bumps that end up saving the day! Of course, some American / Korean agents are trying to stop them on the way. <br /> <br /> The sister was just included in the movie so she could finally make the important shot. It was clich√©d, you knew it was going to happen, but to make it worse, she made it all that part! and my last annoyance, how the hell did the child survive at the end? The sample swam with the head under water for about 5 minutes! Why didn't the monster eat the children in the first place?
