Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a terrible movie. It's just a superposition of scenes without a clear link. Action is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor such as Ezzat El allayli. But something is really amazing in this movie, talking about sexuality, emancipation of women, nude screens are very scarce in Arabic theater, even in these days. I congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian movies, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote this movie as a terrible one are not just scenario and acting, but also the lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur one. We can see many errors in the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie, Ziab la ta'kol is not the one recommended. But if you want to encourage the uncensored movies in all the Arab world, watch it and make your friends and family the same.
