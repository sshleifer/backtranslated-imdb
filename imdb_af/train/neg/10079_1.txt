When I was 11, Grease 2 was like cracking. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric and powerful addictive experience. My sister and I will see it, rinse it back, and watch it again and again and again until we have gone out or become too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you're an 11-year-old girl, and you've seen this movie as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original fat," you have to blame your adolescent adolescent hormones and you can be sure that this unworthy If you are not a little girl, however, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Smear 2 was nothing but an obscene, artless, shoddy embarrassment to all who participated. in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I would appreciate the movie now by explaining why it is blowing ?? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should promote the story or develop the characters. In Smeer 2, with some debatable exceptions, the music is insignificantly useless. Most of the songs appear in an excessive and general way to have a brand new insinuation about sex ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin") without a concrete statement about any of the movie characters or themes. Plus, all the music is uncomfortable and no one in the role-playing show even the cruelest view of the ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. The T-birds should be bad, and if not, it's not a bit nice, but instead everyone is an annoying dirty dufus loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the holy T-bird jacket and initiates him in the gang, Michael should kick it on the ground, spit it on, and duck to scrub any part of his body touched by it. But of course he accepts it as being gold, because despite being a bunch of pounding meat heads, there is no greater honor than being one with the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. However, since Michael is beautiful, smart, friendly and resourceful, and above all in its entirety (his musical impotence is impossible), it is feasible that Stephanie will eventually embrace him when he announces him as the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a messy, slack-jawed, bubble gum smear, dirty sweater wear, grasless rude and trashy dingbat. So, besides being beautiful, she has no peculiar characteristics, so the audience is not justified for the depth of Michael's appeal to her. <br /> <br /> I can go on and off, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to his predecessor, as there are so many stools out there that seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I would say to those of you who think you want to return this mess because of the old time: Fat 2 is an experience related to the revival of your first kiss. Only you are now 32 and kiss a 13-year-old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you stay dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
