The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP member of parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his relationship with the Amelia Earhart character Katherine Hepburn played. Until they met, he was a very dedicated man, but when he met the strange but fascinating Hepburn, he couldn't help him "and they fell in love. You could say, because they are very much in space and Speaking endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is, honestly, it's a very dated and virtually impossible movie to watch.A part of the problem is that in the Pre-Code days movies glamorous adultery was very common. , even if you accept this morally suspicious subject, it becomes clear as a novel from the 19th century ... and a very bad one, sticky and hard to keep characters (in fact, Clive's wife is a good lady and no one did any harm) make this one a great waste of time.On the only interesting aspect of this movie is the Hepburn costume in an early scene, where she is dressed in a mantle costume! You have to see it to believe it - and she looks like one of the Bugaloos (a clear but fitting vein) rwysing).
