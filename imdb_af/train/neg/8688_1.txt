If the only sex you've ever had is at a farm animal, the tagline for this movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> It's by far one of the most boring movies I've had. pleasure to watch lately. I found the DVD lying at my friend's house and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can't tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details about it. Movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-team. Only the fiction movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring c-team debate. <br /> <br /> I think there's a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I couldn't figure out exactly what it was after I threw out my eyeballs and threw it at Richard Gere.
