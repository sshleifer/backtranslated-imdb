Has anyone changed this movie? Or was it just the DVD edition that had big thirty second gaps between scenes? It is, though, I fell asleep and saw it for the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's close. The acting is not the worst I have ever seen ... but it's close. The production .... well, I can honestly say it was the worst I have ever seen in my life! I'm not trying to regret it, but Unhinged could have used even more production. <br /> <br /> Don't think I'm a hater of horror movies, or even that I didn't enjoy this movie. I just felt I was laughing much more at the movie than I felt I was laughing at it. The horrific moments were not done too badly, but could be done better, even with a shocking budget. Characters developed uncomfortably, or they all ignored, the end of the turn was pretty bad, and the exposition went on forever. without much exposure. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
