Just finished this movie ... watch it on the video rack and be a Nick Stahl fan. I just had to rent it. In all honesty, it probably had to stay on the shelf. The concept was an interesting one and there were several pretty clever turns and turns, but somehow I said almost all of them before they came together. And the movie has, in my opinion, gone a little too far ... if you have to suffer from it, you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to do). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same kind of character. Too much Paul Finch from American Pie comes to my mind. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie should be Jan Jones's emotional performance ... I think a pretty face is really all that matters in Hollywood.
