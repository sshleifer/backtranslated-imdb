So, where are the cannibals? Those who are inspired by the title and the "real cannibal" appeal of this film are dropped. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his visit to a village of Papua New Guinea, full of natives, one decade before which was his lover. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is Jewish in New York as they come and somehow it is interwoven with the documentary as he appears in various scenes in his yamika. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: only stories conveyed by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and good cinematography. Schneebaum remains highly enjoyable throughout and offers us a fascinating look at a life that is so far from Western civilization as one can get. <br /> <br /> It's just not what it claims to be on the front page and in the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, kids.
