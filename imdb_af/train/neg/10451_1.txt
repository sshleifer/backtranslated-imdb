I'm sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie is rocked. It's pure CG overworked CRAP! Don't send an Assassin, it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored, aggressive, poisonous snakes on a plane! The only reason people feel like this movie is because they feel they need to. It's not that bad, it's good. It's so bad, I'd rather be caught up with a sharp stick. I honestly thought was a KOMEDIE like AIRPLANE! A spoof! I was wrong. This is the whole "It sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson shouted "Snakes on the plane!". It's a pity, I don't get it. A lot of lashes seem to have given the film industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you spend money buying a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung's CD, they still live in their mommies basement, and stink plastic chair sweaty days on the computer playing online games and watching porn, then rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt you have a girl) tickets for snakes on a stupid knob. Up to hell with movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. No irony to watch good movies. The true decline of Western civilization. It's an insult to true cult classics like Repo man or even Orgazmo. I said enough here.
