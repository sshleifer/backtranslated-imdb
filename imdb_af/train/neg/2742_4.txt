I just happened to stumble upon this movie channel. My first reaction was, "Oh God not again!". It's so hip to play a retard. It has become pretentious and honestly despised. However, for some reason I stayed and watched it to the end. Maybe it was my belief in the actors, hoping they would give me something to encourage. <br /> <br /> and sure, Ken and Helena can act. Also, the movie progresses to something better to the end and actually makes a point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has an average side that she uses to keep her away and sorry. then she again has a soft side that only seeks love. The only thing that surprised me even more was Branagh's character. It was a triumph of acting. The movie itself is nothing unique. <br /> <br /> See if you are an acting student ... if you are looking for pure entertainment you can hit this one. this is sean penn serious! Oh me, it was a bit difficult, but it contains some jokes ... not for the escapists.
