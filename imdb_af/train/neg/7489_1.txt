American movies about war and Nazis simply can't be good. They can't stop being idiot and following an agenda. All Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest yet so capable and meaningful and human. Come on, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like "at this trial our aggressive war must make a crime." Is America a peaceful nation with its world # 1 $ 420bn "defense" budget (# 2 China with only $ 51b)? Is it just spent here without any ROI? Why does America portray as a peaceful nation when it is not? I don't like movies with an agenda - they throw art at hell and try to convince us to believe something. Hollywood has to put a label on movies, just as the record companies have that "parenting" tag. We must have a "bullshit advisory", "propaganda advice" or a "politically correct" label on some movies. This is one of them.
