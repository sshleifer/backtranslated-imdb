Whilst disagreeing with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny, he is definitely in this movie. It's a pity, because I suspect the other reviewer had just seen a few Charley Chase Duds and assume the man wasn't funny. Movies Like POWERS AS A MOOSE AND WHAT PRICES GOOF? are very good chase movies, so he can be really funny, good material provided. Unfortunately, in this film he was given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil is no help, because the basic premise (son wants to marry girl, but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a pity, because I wanted to love this movie, but couldn't. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who are looking to find Charley from the mid-1920s, you'll be pretty surprised. such as chasing no glasses or mustache - and looks very little like you would expect.
