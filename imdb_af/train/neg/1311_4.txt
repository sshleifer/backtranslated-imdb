Jerry Spies Tom listens to a creepy story on the radio and grabs the opportunity to scare his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I didn't find this episode so funny: the humor was quite limited and the whole set up (Jerry is essentially the "bad guy" in this one, and bad Tom becomes for no specific reason <br /> <br /> Occasionally there is a flash of inspiration (like Tom's literal 'heart in the mouth' experience, and the moment his nine lives are poured out of his body), but In general, this effort lacks the frenetic pacing, excellent animation and pure white of most of T & J's other cartoons.
