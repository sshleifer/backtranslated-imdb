This movie is one reason why IMDB should allow a 0/10 voice. The acting is terrible, even what some have praised here, the Karpathia character! The writing looks like it was written in rabbit. In one scene, the black preacher left behind when he was asked by Buck what "then7" meant in the computer graphics, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER * 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers missed this glamor. Perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is biblical. While many Christians used the film's interpretation of end-time events, I believe that such an interpretation is erroneous. To understand these mistakes, read "Christians go through the tribulation" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, a Bible Study of the Second Coming and the Rapture" by George E. Ladd.
