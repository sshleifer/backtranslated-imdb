I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a submarine on patrol in the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the evening. We all rose to the second line. They didn't even try to show it. Rather choose a repetition ...... This is all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comments should contain ten lines. I'm not supposed to place the comments randomly, so I'll just keep running until I get my 10 lines of BS. I couldn't get George Goble on the credits, but I remember him in the movie. Sin was terrible and the songs worse.
