I only saw this movie on TV and I have to admit, I was a little surprised it was even up. There were so many goofs, mess-ups, and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street was better to watch. The acting was OK, but you can really feel the "Straight to Video" feel. The cast / crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait ten minutes before the end to hear it. Trust me, you won't even tell the difference.
