In 2004 I liked it. Then it became very stupid. This indicates that children are brainless. It insults children. Cartoon Network was great. One of the shows I held was Hamtaro. It has managed to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to child programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like placing 20 spoons of sugar in your sprite. The television producers seem to be interested in making money today, rather than making the imagination of children and making money! Lately my kids are adapting to the old shows (60's) to see something that is interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television to watch the past and reuse children's programming from passing days.
