This is one of the worst written movies I've ever had to go through. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so what cares, as long as it's nice and fun? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go as deep as the characterizations, or I'll be all day (except to say there isn't any; the characters change personality when it's convenient for the plot) But whoever wrote the writing and visual direction should be allowed access to as much as pencil and paper. Thumbs up? I will vote to cut off their thumbs. <br /> <br /> "Restrict on an object / prop. Cut back to character closeness. Character gives a knowledge that the audience doesn't even understand. Repeat it several times, using different objects / props. "<br /> <br />" Do not pay attention to the characters. All the big cliffs of rock drift around, fall apart, usually dominate in general. They can all kill them at any moment - but stop them fear if they see a harmless, almost pastoral green rock in the distance. "<br /> <br /> The whole thing is a long sequence of events, actions, and behaviors just for the convenience of the writer. to save him to think or to make any effort to write the story correctly. . <br /> <br /> This is the Plan 9 of CG cartoons, except that it doesn't have Ed Wood's green factor to make it fun. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor: spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies.
