Looking at the other comments, I am surprised that there are no warnings for potential viewers of what to look for when renting this garbage. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a skillfully delivered Indiana Jones knock. What I got was one of the most offensive movies I can remember trying to go through, and it shocks me through the movie's relatively high production values. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's a spoiler, but if that's the case, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your entertainment idea, Bimbo is hit by Fearsome Tribal Chief, as she stares in the dead eyes of her significant other's cut head, it means, rent this movie. If not, I will advise you to have fun elsewhere elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Think about it, the scene so briefly the movie that there is nothing else I really need to say about it.
