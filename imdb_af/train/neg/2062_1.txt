I read all the reviews here after watching this piece of film garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone else didn't think this terrible unfunny montage was the mood in the 70's, or even in any other era! If it's not the least funny set of sketch * comedy *, I've ever seen it do it until it comes. Half of the sketch was already done (and infinitely better) by acts like Monty Python and Woody Allen. If I were to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds, it's the highlight of this movie. Don't get up briefly, but how senseless and drunk this 75 minute waste is. Seminal comedy? Only in the world where seminal really means semen. Scatological humor? Only in a world where scat is actually faeces. Forerunner jokes? Just if that means it is a manual of how not to do comedy. Tits and bums and the strange beaver. Nice ... if you're a frizzy boy with at least one hand free and didn't notice that Playboy exists. Does it give a break because it was the early 70's? Not at all. There was a sketch comedy going back at least ten years ago. The only way I can even forgive even this movie is if it was on rifle. Retro? Rare. Subtle tolerant sketch sketches can be the forefront in some circles (and it might have been funny), but it just comes out as really sad. What kept me going for 75 minutes? Simply convinced that they can save a really funny slit for the end. I gave the movie a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients ... or maybe people who suffer from lockjaw ... their jaws will eventually open in disbelief.
