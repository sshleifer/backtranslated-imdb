It is somewhat to say that most of the great reviews for the movie on IMDb all come from people who have just reviewed one movie in their entire IMDb career and yes, you guessed it, the movie is "Parasomnia". I supposedly suspiciously think good reviews on IMDb for what seems to be just good movies as well as private marketing, but it seems pretty transparent in this case. It is not to say Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops very short of the good or good movie that has the potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it has a great bath in Patrick Kilpatrick doing a brilliant job that portrays threatening and angry, I could easily see what it takes to have a memorable bath on a playing equally with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful footage in the dream sequence, actually if the movie has decided to explore that site more, it could have been something better. The real concept of devastating abuse of hypnosis is also wonderful. Although I understand that suspension of unbelief is needed for immersion in any good story, it is the sign of a good story that succeeds in doing so. . If you find yourself irritated by what you find illogical or simply stupid, then the story loses you and that's what happened to me with this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned it here, and I don't want to be in the spoiler area, but I would say the set-up was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not the changing mental age of a character who is only supposed to experience a few years of life. <br /> <br /> All in all, the germ of a good idea here in diabolically abused hypnotism, but unfortunately this film is not realizing it in anything special.
