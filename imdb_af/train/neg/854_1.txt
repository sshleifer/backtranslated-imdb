Ladies and gentlemen, don't be fooled by a Stanley Kubrick movie marker. This is a very bad movie that was unfortunately regarded as one of the deadliest horror movies ever made. Horror movies should be so frightening that during nights people should snatch their hearts while thinking of a real horror movie. In Shining there is no real horror, but what we find rather is a naive, foolish attempt to create chilling horror. Everyone knows how good the efforts are. is if they differ from reality. All that is good in the movie is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were filed also appears good. A word from actors, Jack Nicholson, looks like a lost lazy soul that is never really sure of what he is supposed to do. Not much is said of a naked. , a colored actor who, for the most part, is pampering a child actor. No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. It can't be avoided if the film is made and poor Kubrick doesn't live to make any changes.
