I have not yet decided if it will replace Anaconda as the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the dodgy accent, work low production values ​​and horrible camera, this movie is absolutely nothing for it. I just went to see it as I read the book and wanted to see how they would work the intricate plot in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they don't. Characters appear with little or no explanation about who they are and continue to play no valuable part in the story. Even the main characters work without reason, so by the time the movie reaches its peak, you don't care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can assume that books should sometimes be rewritten to fit in movies and that it may be unfair to judge this film against the book it is adapted to. But after my friends and I came out of the theater, I had to spend most of the trip, explaining what was supposed to happen. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the book title "Rancid Aluminum" by pushing it into another piece of senseless voice so they can give the movie a cool title. <br /> <br /> A real mess of a movie from start to finish.
