A little worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script. Ants become mysterious in killer ants near a hotel. I think it's out of the hotel because the hotel sewer drains directly into the ant bed. There is a lack of tension in this movie and it is not scary either. Seeing a lot of ants hiding their victims is not very scary. <br /> <br /> Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is almost incredible. He is told that the health inspector says the ants cannot be the hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector said this, the hero took his bulldozer and wrecked the great ant colony. It disturbs the millions of ants and falls to the people of the hotel. <br /> <br /> End spoilers Overall, this movie is extremely lame. I don't understand why it has a DVD release if so many deserving movies have nothing. My only suggestion for the DVD edition is that Suzanne Summers appears in the movie. It's a movie to avoid.
