Completely forgotten. Special because of the poor acting. This is the first movie I saw at Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he has been around since the late 90's. I thought he was a newcomer, as his play was so tiring. I can say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw her well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character, a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton could, but it was quite strange to see her say her lines whisper. It seems that there really is not a very good chemistry between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton also felt it. She is a fantastic actress, but just looks a bit at the top of this movie. It felt like she wanted this movie as soon as possible. I won't blame her.
