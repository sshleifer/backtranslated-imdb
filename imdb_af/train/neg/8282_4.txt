By now, you should already know about this movie, the Jessica Simpson bomb that goes pretty much directly to the video (limited anemic theater circles). Basically, me. Simpson's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, just to get him in bed with another woman. She is stranded, but has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I wish we had seen more often in film), which allowed her to stay. Katie ends with a job by two fine-tuned co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick) who only uses Katie to get the firm's president (Larry Miller). It's strictly a b-movie, it's not meant to be deep. Jessica Simpson is by no means a great actress, but she is very beautiful and never really annoying. The movie is viewable because it's not an abomination, but its cast fluff. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle in-joke about Milwaukee has hurt me), and there's a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (don't read too much in it). So, not terrible, but easy to skip. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever happens. Again, not good, but not a major disaster.
