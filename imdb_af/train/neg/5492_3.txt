The people at Disney have a lot to explain. First, why anyone thought this less-sitcom material would ever make a half-decent movie. In the kooky 60's teleplay, the unique idea of ​​Martians among us has not yet been given the sophisticated X-Files treatment. Beautiful visions of small green men have long been driven by the ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> Any charm that the property had was mainly due to the close relationship between the late Bill Bixby and Tim and Ray Walston as the worldly visitor. The expectation of Martians having antennas seemed to be dull. Now it looks positive idiot. Yet, Christopher Lloyd's uncle Martin sports the metal attachments. In an early shot, the antenna on a board for the TV station that Tim works is supposed to make us think "martian"! When is the last time you've seen a TV with rabbit ears, among other things? <br /> <br /> Disney doesn't trust beautifully or relatives and stomp this movie with special welfare species that includes a talk pack called Zoot! Yes, you read it correctly - Uncle Martin's silver space suit speaks. He's supposed to be a real hilarious cut! Figure again. I have stretch socks that are worse than Zoot. When the action loads (and it gets constantly), computer graphics are put into play to get things done. Tim is played here by the beloved Jeff Daniels, who can not (or does not) do to save this fluffy mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings a funny fervor to her closest lady role. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully dragged into the procedures - all in vain. This stranger is dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> Constant talk of sitcoms turning to the screen just makes me hope that the I DREAM OF JEANNIE movie won't have a harem outfit. I pray that Samantha's cat in the movie does NOT have lines. I live in fear that I love LUCY. The film will be proud of a CG Conga Drum called Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - Take me to your leader.
