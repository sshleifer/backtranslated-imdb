We are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. We can confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confessing that this view is in many ways incomprehensible and that it is clear that much of it is created from pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, many people like such things. I don't. I prefer well thought and planned performances. And I also confess that the show is far too serious for my taste and boring ... those love and drug stories ... There are so many exciting soaps with a lot of tension (Dallas eg), but Twin Peaks can't catch up. my attention. I don't care for those people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
