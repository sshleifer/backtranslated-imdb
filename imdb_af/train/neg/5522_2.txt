I searched for the right words to describe this movie. Initially, I tended to simply move on to more significant issues, as the film did not rise to a level-worthy comment. <br /> <br /> Yet, I stopped, amazed at how to describe such things and somewhat irrigated by the challenge posed by the question: "What can one say about such a movie?" Litter? No, it's not junk, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gases? No, it is not greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants to grow large and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally I touched on "Not even bad", a review of the phrase "Not even wrong" sometimes used in theoretical physics To describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed is not even correct. This is Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
