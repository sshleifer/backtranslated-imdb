The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent, and I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost from revenge against a group of friends. The story is stupid, mixes two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night, a sprinkler I know you did last Saturday, and add a small line of Single White Female - now blend in to completely nonsense. There is nothing new on this plot, and the repetition of the clich√©s that I have grown so much was not even entertained this time. This movie has gone too far from the past, and as soon as I realized it all, it still didn't make much sense. Characters go from healthy to psycho-murderer in the eye of the eye. To speak of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish attorney, the egocent actress, the popular baseball player, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the ghostly silent chick, the 'nicer than nice' pretty girl, a freakin 'black cat ... and i didn't care about any of them. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall this movie was a mess. I also need to mention a certain "video tape" that would be impossible to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror to offer, but it's pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to scream aloud for some on top of the scene, or just want to shout: "You're stupid!" on a movie screen, or just want to make another Asian horror flash on your sleeve when someone asks you how much you saw - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plot look elsewhere.
