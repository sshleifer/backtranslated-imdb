I usually only comment on movies I like, to "determine everyone to his own taste", but here I want to make an exception. The prospect of this movie, lost in some way in the shuffle, is that these two self-centered adults have a perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry and unpredictable suffering on their respective breads. of children. Even for the culturally sinned intimidation, they do not have the courage or responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have implemented. After all, "love" is all that matters, isn't it? To hell with everyone else. Whether things finally work out "is really not the point; in fact, it is rather irrelevant. The point is that disrespect for others, especially when they are young, and especially when they are in a position of dependence, is made lightly and thus reinforced by this movie, there are many more harmless behaviors that these "parents" could do that would break down an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat.
