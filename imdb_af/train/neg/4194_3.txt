This film has a lot of promise with the story of a director who loses his face and a blind woman who will help him. But somewhere in the middle it seemed as if the authors didn't know where to go. <br /> <br /> An incredible event has the following (Russia must be very small because they all bump into each other all the time), the motivation of the female main character understandable (why she still follows him after they why not try to borrow a phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mom and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? And what was the story with the younger sister?). Still with all this apparent randomness of the plot, the movie managed to be completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the movie was good, the footage and the score were very nice and the actors of the main characters were also good. So it could have been a very good movie ... but it wasn't.
