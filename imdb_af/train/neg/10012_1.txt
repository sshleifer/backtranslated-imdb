This movie should be for the most boring movie during the year. Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from zinc to below. <br /> <br /> The murder in this movie is supposed to be the interest in this movie, but nothing is important. The movie is not bad, but the writing is just awful, I just sat amazed at this movie and thought how on earth someone could entertain this movie. <br /> <br /> The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie, but it hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their role. People will go to the heretic and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe, it must be good and rent this movie. (Son puts them in for a terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you want to get rid of this movie, some people actually enjoy this movie, but I like to watch a movie with meaning
