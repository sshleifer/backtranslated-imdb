"True" story of three girls going into the wilds of Connecticut and eventually being driven by a maniac in the woods. This is the kind of film that has been playing in America 30 years ago thirty years ago. Not much of everything, the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is viewable, but not terrifying (blaming some of the screens for that). It's the kind of movie you're likely to forget when you're done with it. Chances are you will never think of seeing it unless it has been handed over to you and said, "Look over here", what happened to me. If you hand over a copy, give it back, the movie is not worth seeing, even if it is visible.
