A Slasher movie made in the early 80's has a curse that kills anyone trying to finish it. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the movie - also the film's deadly curse. Great idea for a movie, but unfortunately, 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia didn't have the world's best record when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (1984) was an out and out dud like 'Holwing III' (1987), which was a half American movie anyway. As for our counterfeit in the comedy horror, 'Body Melt' (1993) is best forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that the creators are trying to create a smart horror satire a la 'Scream' (1996), but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. And although it's strange to me to say about a slasher movie, but what 'Cut' really lacks, is a "heart". It certainly follows the basic rules set by 'Scream', but it doesn't want to play with the formula. Instead, it goes for a cardboard copy from the previous one. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncarismatic villains in horror movie history. His endless barrage uncomfortable, lame one-liners would make the dialogue of a porn like Shakespeare look. The role-play never looks as if they are completely involved and looks as if they are just waiting for a shot to be over, so they can pick up their paycheck. And the feeling of the movie is as it deliberately tries not to be dirty; look more like an episode of 'Bure' or 'Heartbreak High'. Incidentally, the efforts of MTV style, hyperbiography during the "research" series, seem just lame, dated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia ever gets a chance to do horrors (which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf out of the "Mad Max" (1979) book. Instead of trying to copy the US, we must try our own approach to the genre.
