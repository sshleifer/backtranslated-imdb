I've been climbing on these shelves for years because of the lack of intelligence communicated by the reviews that regularly appear on the IMDb space of this movie. I watched this movie with the movie of the New York Asian Film Festival (which had an otherwise select choice of movies, see this year's key snake of June, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and regret every day scene from that movie I'm sure you can read a laudatory summary of the movie from the Subway Cinema. That's probably why I made the mistake. to drag my friend to the movie. The description built up the kind of horror movie that I longed for, one that relied on pure terror rather than cheap scarce. P was actually different. It was based on cheap laughter. <br /> <br /> The incredibly annoying expert described this movie as "Lesbians team to fight monsters." Absolutely false. There is a subplot built into this movie to make it look as if the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This movie looks like a short made for "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and has only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally see their attempt to see this film with any serious feelings and try to forget about the $ 9 they wasted at the door. . I wish Paul was in the audience so I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in Thailand to make a bad soft-horror-cum porn that belongs to the spice channel, which just manages to to get the actress out of her family, and caused a slight stir on the Belgian film festival. The only rudder it caused was a gargle in the small intestine, as it couldn't extract itself from the k * it is. Anyway, I hope I can upset someone to make the serious mistake of seeing this movie. It was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences and broke the soul plane for number 2.
