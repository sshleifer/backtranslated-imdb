The 1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same title has been condemned because it is bad special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked for this horror comedy, they are positively staggering. The killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam and his arms look like excessive oven gauge. What they probably were. The film is immense in this parody of decades of (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the city doctor is especially memorable in a small but hilarious role.
