I never finished this movie for a reason, it was terrible and it's just the play. I wasn't even sure what the movie was about tbh, it didn't make much sense and the violence was terrible. I mean ususally, I like a nude in a movie (lol), but it was just sick because of what happened. All the characters irritated me and it was just full of loud screaming and the camera shook on parts and it looked like a sequel to the project's leaf, but without any good features. This is one of the worst movies I've seen long ago and would like to return my time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, or even consider it. (N)
