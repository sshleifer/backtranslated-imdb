I think this one sucked on ice because it left the cube and we gave too much information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube, and it all imagined it. This crap fest however gives you everything. and I didn't like it. Although the play is solid, I think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers, if they did Vincenzo Natali this prequel, or even the sequel I think would do better and would have been more to the source. so I recommend staying far, far from this one, and HYPERCUBE, another movie I don't even want to discuss ... (I just gave it a 2 for the play)
