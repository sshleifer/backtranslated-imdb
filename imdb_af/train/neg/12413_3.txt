I'm not going to say this movie is horrible, because I've seen it worse, but it's not even half-way. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I couldn't really figure out what was going on and where things were going. When the movie was over, I scratched my head. I watched until the end of the credits to see if they had anything to do with them that could solve things, but once the credits were over, it was. I felt that I was thrown from one bad plot to another through the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> Character development is very level. I couldn't figure out when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I couldn't tell if half of the characters were just drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or just had a bad actor to portray them. This movie seems to be based on stereotypes (it's credit, it's hard to avoid when you make a movie about a singer in a rock group), which should facilitate the development of character, as so many other films are illustrated. already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to clean. Stereotypes are easy to portray, which would explain why so many bad movies tend to use stereotypical characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they are discharged without any explanation. I think it's OK because so little time has been spent developing the characters that I really didn't have the chance to get to know any of them, so I never really missed one of them. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Sadie's song was. It's terrible. The music that supports her is not the prize winner, but it is usually drowned by the screams released from Sadie's vocal chords. I swear that there is one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I should turn it off during this boost. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing. Characters are poorly developed, Georgia's acting is wood and stiff. Sadie's character is chased from one bad situation to another, with no recourse or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can't think of any good reason to watch this movie unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.
