This comedy has some tolerant funny things in it, surrounded by a lot of indecent things. Almost every scene in which the castle's servants are involved and their stupid antiques is a waste of time. And the plot is so sloppy it makes you wonder if they actually had a script before they started filming, or they simply made it while they went along. (* 1/2)
