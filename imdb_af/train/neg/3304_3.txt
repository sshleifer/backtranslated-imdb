Greenthumb Grace was left inexorably after the death of her husband, so she changed Ganja's bills to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the always reliable Brenda Blethyn set doesn't disappoint, but the material is sitcom thin. There is actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" (a rope) and he thinks she is asking for sex and doing everything uncomfortable. Yes, it's humor so two, a nun, will be bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what it wants to be: the spectacular cinematography and stately tempo evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter while the lighthearted clumsy of the townspeople could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but it is too short to care. The climax succeeds in just being unpredictable by introducing the most shameful Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.
