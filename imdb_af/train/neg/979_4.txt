Anyone who has a distant interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies to start. It's good, but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is much better choice than this series. SOYLENT is probably scientists best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest but most forgotten movies, but the impact of its environment is becoming more and more real with every day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most of SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and touches his final scenes. <br /> <br /> This is Manhattan in 2022, the world is crowded and food is an incredible fortune (a small bottle of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A major executive for the Soylent company is being murdered and police detective, Thorn, is on the point. <br /> <br /> The secret of greenery is not a mystery if you do research on the film. SOYLENT is nice to watch, but the whole script is a joke. It's just as cheap as the whole production. The screenplay and the plays of the actors made the movie, but was completely hilarious. Everybody seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically Cop Thorn who just likes to make waltz in people's apartments, look shameless and steal everything he wants. The character's interactions keep your attention on the movie, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. An enjoyable piece if you have the time, but expect nothing more.
