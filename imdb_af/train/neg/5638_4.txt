Only one thing could have saved this sketch. A healthy rifle battle between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicacies and the motel's old counter (that would have been) looked out of the bush and the guys aged at the guys when they shared the rubber house. <br /> <br /> In the process, they could have blown the freezing hut for smithereens, most of the nights solved; like the "harder bitch" owls on the windshield, the reason why the protagonist "had no friends" and also explained his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, ceaseless calls. . . And it's a gazebo, the green thumb, and its appeal to the simpler life. Completely the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue servant? A little heartbeat would have been nice. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see if these people were moving around, I think, but Eleanora's stupid Italian games were choked stereotypically while the caretaker was too many yoga classes. Dick, a thought and a bakkie summed it up for him. I also wished they could have a little more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after she puts a black lingerie in her bare red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard cardboard box at the motel. <br /> <br /> Trifling case, you can say. I agree, though, the niggling just hasn't done well in this rush. Good owl wrangling, and I really feel cold all the way through.
