After growing up in Texas and being less than 15 miles from Gilley's, I can tell you this movie is tempting. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie suggests. The plot is poor, and the false accent is amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans beer drinks, base tonkin, rednecks. The terribly fake Texas accent is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang for most Texans accents, but these people surpass it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta had to hold onto disco-dancing or the 50's. Debra Winger was more convincing than Wonder Girl as she was a Texan.
