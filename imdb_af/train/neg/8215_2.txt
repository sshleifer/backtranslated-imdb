I actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. A high school drama class can undoubtedly do a better job or at least a job. The actors must have thought it would be their great chance to work in a movie, it was definitely not. In addition to the horrific acting, the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. The one about the remote didn't even make sense. For the bad reason it had the best assumption in the crowd. <br /> <br /> I'm all for supporting low-budget movies and giving new movie makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I just watched it because there were good comments posted. They had to be planted by people with ties to the film. You can mislead people to look at them, but you can't deceive them to keep what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 instead of 1, because at least the goat server tried trying warmth. Sure it failed, but it did try. I keep 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. I wish I had.
