This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was stupid, all the way to the end. This reminded me of something that was put to the home video market in the 1980s. I would have given it one, but there were short moments when you could see that the actors really really wanted to make it worth it. I think the worst was the underwater scene that was kept from the cabin. The underwater lighting apparently came from no creatures, and when someone we were supposed to give was close to the air, this air tank would look like it. I will avoid it unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
