Anyone who thinks this film is not appreciated because his comic genius had to smoke with the two stoners in the film. This movie is NOT underestimated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane, as the latter two films are well written and funny. Class reunion is not one of those things. The sad thing is that it has such a potential (good throw, good story lines), but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny became more annoying than amusing. The stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl ... NOT FUNNIES. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has made some great movies (Animal House, Vacation), but it's not one of them. I expected more from John Hughes.
