The reason I was planning to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was just 35 minutes) was my wish to understand the Indian theater and hopefully appreciate it. All I have ever seen was a few older films by S.Ray. <br /> <br /> Browsing IMDb, I looked at this one and looked at the rating of 8,7, I concluded, it must be the one that opens the doors of unknown. and bring artistic pleasure. Oh how wrong was I? The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of 970 people who voted were Indians and their only venture outside Bolliwood production was Adam Sandler movies. <br /> <br /> With this rating, this movie will be ranked 9th. on IMDb List of 250 best movies above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas or Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to revisit and criticize, because there's simply nothing I remembered to remember about this painful experience. My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindu who, like me, finds this movie as it is - simply silly, with plenty of kitsch and cheese music.
