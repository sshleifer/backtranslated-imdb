This movie makes several mistakes. A few American actors in Spain and the Spanish actors who speak English. The "Spaniards" English is good, but the way the acting is performed makes it all very annoying. the dialogue throughout the writing is very poor; It may have been a Spanish script, but incorrectly translated, who knows and cares. I can only assume that these well-known Spanish actors are forced into the English language, they may be good, but not in this flop. you will find out the movie within the first 5 minutes, that's how pathetic it is. then the rest is just bad. many waste of time, many UN essential plots. Oh, I mentioned that one of the Baldwins is here.
