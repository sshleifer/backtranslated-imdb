I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to see it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from NYC to LA to get her recent upset loss. Shortly after she came to a guy who fell in love with her, it became clear that she had an evil twin gangster, who focused on her. <br /> <br /> The movie is very poor and mean. Both the dialogues and actors do not really make the movie worth seeing. Summary is just something for Drew Barrymore supporters.
