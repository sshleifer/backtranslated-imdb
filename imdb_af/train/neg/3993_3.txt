This movie was exactly what I expected, not good, but not so bad either. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not scary, so I knew I was going to be bored throughout the film. Sure, there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we've all seen yet. I think I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns; It has become old and repetitive. I also didn't understand if all the things that Cusack experienced in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie just goes on and when it finally comes to an end, you want to keep it going, because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie is about. What I liked was the special effects. Other than that, there wasn't much enjoyment from it. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
