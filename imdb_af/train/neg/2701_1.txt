First of all yes I am white, so I try to tread lightly in the distinctive subject of race ... anyway ... White People Hating Black people = BAD but Black people Hate white people = OK (because we apparently earned it . !!). where do I start? I wish I had something good to say about this movie as well as unintentional comedy scenes: The notorious scene was Ice Cube and co. come in battle with some very big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking Neo-Nazis and win! the neo-Nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! the chase is priceless. It is not a film about race, tolerance and understanding. It's not a racist movie that confirms all the clich√© stereotypes. The white wimpy man being treated by his husband's black roommate automatically changes into a skinhead ... just plain awful, I'm sorry to ever see it. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the awful experience of a poorly written, poorly educated, boring and clearly biased picture, if you are in the subject, go and hire American History X, now a movie
