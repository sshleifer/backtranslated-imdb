In fact, the 80's trend of disgusting violence is considered a horror movie. I was the target audience for this apostate piece of garbage and I was as disgusting as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where do we start? Let's see the setup: You can bring people back to life if they died a violent death. So that legally poor premise is the excuse to have butchers people in terrible ways, because it is necessary to bring them back! It could have been played over it because black is a la-re-animator or something. But no, it's played straight. There is a very scared family in a wagon being cut off, one of the few scenes where their downfall is out of the screen. But just about everything is on the screen. There is actually a scene where a young girl walks, beats and kills by zombie villagers, who are all filmed and grabbed with various cameras. Then there is a close-up of her face as the filmmakers reveal lovingly and time-consuming over time. Her worn face is cut into a skull and rebuilt to look normal again. Of course, this happened by a slumbering Jack Albertson as the mortar behind it all. He likes to drive around in an ambulance / elevator that plays old Tommy Dorcey tunes. It's supposed to be cute. <br /> <br /> Eventually even the Sheriff even walks and the doctor kindly offers. to tie his rotting hands. Not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other townspeople who are killing children and cutting off their faces, needles in burnt eyes, etc. Don't post. <br /> <br /> I really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give a rating at all. It's not scary, the twists are laughing and overall it's sick. It's not even good enough to "see it on a fool" or to enjoy on a level you might see a bad HG Lewis movie. It's just God-fearing trash that is made for people who come across this kind of relentless gore, and are slumbered by people for a salary. <br /> <br /> Sad that Albertson was even involved.
