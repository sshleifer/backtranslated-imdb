Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first lead, shows her real rebellious nature in this slow moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is it a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> To be a strong feminist in real life, she must have cherished this script. No wonder left-wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; It is also right on its political rise. <br /> <br /> Unlike the judges here, I'm glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in entertaining movies and not preaching the heavy-handed liberal agenda.
