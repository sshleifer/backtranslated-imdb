This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a wonderful movie. Nothing new or original is added, except Perry's flashbacks, which are of marginal importance. It lacks the documentary feelings of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added a lot to the original movie. I can't understand any high ratings for this. It's pretty bad. Why doesn't someone waste time or money making such a shit and why did I waste time looking at it?
