I have an advice for the people who made this movie. If you are going to make such a movie, make sure you have the f / x to make it back. Also, don't get a lot of z-list players to play in it. Another thing, all of us, saw Jurassic Park, so don't copy it in a blatant way. All in all, this movie was sucked, f / x sucked, acting sucked, story original. Let's talk about the play for just a second, the Carradine guy whose career appeared in 1984 when he did "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). He's not exactly, he can act. He just had to say no to this bag. He had to do what Mark Hamill did after "Returning the Jedi" and going quiet at night. He made his mark as a "Nerd" and it had to be. I understand he has bills to pay, but it doesn't excuse such a bag. Did I mention this movie? O.K. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2 hours of my life. I could have spent doing something productive, like peeling paint, and I feel cheated. I'll close that note. Thank you for your time.
