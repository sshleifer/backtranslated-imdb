I tried twice to get through this movie, to follow it up for the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and the second time failed despite a good DVD transfer. The problem? This is not too boring. <br /> <br /> When you get to the dramatic courtroom scene, recording most of the second half of the movie, you've made it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting conversations by Abraham Lincoln (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The end is touching as Lincoln walks down and they put his memorial image over the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a nice story, well done and so .... but it sparked in the first half and discouraged the viewer hanging in there. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
