This movie is not only badly written and directed, but is just unpleasant. A beautiful novel is terribly wrong in this movie. Many changes were made to the storyline, presumably to simplify the time frame. But what results are simply confusing. The acting may not overcome the writing that removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to Patriarch Esteban as ESteban. Horrible. Please read the wonderful novel, if possible, in Spanish. Don't see this movie. It will ruin you, which can be a wonderful experience.
