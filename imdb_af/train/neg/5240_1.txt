Once it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms! But on behalf of its producers, I have to say that it does not fall into a well-known movie category, it deserves a brand new denomination of its own! It's a "neurological drama"! It is sad and pressure every single neuron in a human's brain. <br /> <br /> It's the closest thing you'll ever get without suffering one. It makes you speechless, all your members become numb, your mouth falls open and remains so, and the most strange symptom of all is that you become blind and want deaf people. <br /> <br /> No small thing for such a movie. <br /> <br /> The only word that comes into my mind after completing my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
