For all the hype about this movie, I kept an open mind about what I would eventually think. And although it's a bit slow, the first 90% of the movie is pretty good, with more than a few "old time" alarmists making one exciting. I actually thought the cinematography was excellent in many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is at its peak. The end of the film and the unbundling is what MILES APART seems to be from his body. The storyline falls entirely on its face with an illogical conclusion and the answer I was most seeking - what actually happened to Emma? - is not elucidated! The reason for the negative energy was at best ridiculous, and ultimately I was very deceived. What could have been an excellent horror movie was finally haunted by a terrible end.
