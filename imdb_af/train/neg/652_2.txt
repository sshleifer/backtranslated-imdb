I think it was an over-rated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were also good, but some other teenagers in the prom like the top friends were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and looked so stupid. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginal. The movie was also very boring and overstated. It wasn't stress at all, I almost fell asleep. It's another bad PG-13 remake, it's really a horrible movie IMO. The end was so stupid and the climax was very rushing and boring. The movie is also quite slow. Overall, the only good thing about this crap party is maybe BRITTANY SNOW, I think she also provided a good show and IDRIS ELBA, but besides, it was a totally horrible movie and horrible remake. Well that's just my opinion. I gave it a 2/10.
