Well, OK, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I have to say, I actually think this movie is good. This movie caught a buzz as the bootleg I know what you did last summer 3, like Final Stab, was screaming 4, and now this movie is not that bad. I mean it was a mistake and of course, it would be ridiculous to release it in the theaters, but still for a midnight popcorn movie. This movie is not half bad. It has some sweets, and some very hot women I can add. In addition, it appears from Joey Lawrence's new, delicate look, but of course he didn't win a big Hollywood role either. ...... I feel bad for the man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90's blooming, some Disney movies and the eternal Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a little player in the sitcom scene, but when he was in a 360 degree turn, his career went south, but low budget movies like this. <br /> <br /> The movie also throws you in, it reminds you of the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, first to be disappointed to find out the secret. It also throws you at who the murderer is, I have an idea, but still don't think the murderer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret was a great fall. Now, was there a secret left out? This movie could have been one of the better b rated movies. But I'm also struggling for college themes and I have a spring break in college in a cottage with a large beach house, similar to the one here, so it just makes me feel sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> A so-so slasher flick. Good for a midnight movie.
