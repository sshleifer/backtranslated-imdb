I have to admit that I've stuck this one, think something should happen, except the dead body in the first screens ... and her disposal over him. I was wrong. It was a movie story by Betty enclosing the beach for Mordant Morven for the first part. I really don't care what young wads from Scotland are doing these days, who is your screw, what drugs they take. Visually, the walk through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and certainly the highlight for me. The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend. When the movie came to an end, I had two thoughts. 1. It's all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Bokkie Boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm such a sucker to stick these things out.
