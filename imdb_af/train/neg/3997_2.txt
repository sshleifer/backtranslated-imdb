After I noticed the high rating on IMDb, I decided to watch this movie. Besides the high score, I deliberately avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate without knowing the plot or with predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my rating, you can see I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager tried to get him out of the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary stuff. <br /> <br /> First chocolate appears on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin respond to credible manner. He's freaked out. I am encouraged and thought of myself, it will be fine. The people who made this movie understand that is less. <br /> <br /> But that's what happened, which was a big gap. The subtlety is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach ... Shoot the audience with every Hollywood ugly trick in the book and hope something works. Let's see, a clock radio that switches on itself? Well, it's always scary. Objects moving around the room? Well, you can not complain about it. Blood drips from the walls and sink? Great. Ghost who commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, shakes, fire, more shaking, wasting the room, more blood, etc. Etc. It's all good. And it's been done before. Switch our Attention Deficit. Obey with all kinds of goods in a quick succession, and they will not be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it didn't work for me. And you know what else? Looking at a horror movie in a theater, it is typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience screaming in fear of scary moments. But this movie didn't have scary moments. The audience was quiet and uninteresting. I didn't feel like cooling my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x trying to be this movie. <br /> <br /> So, who are these people who say it's one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I get it just does not.
