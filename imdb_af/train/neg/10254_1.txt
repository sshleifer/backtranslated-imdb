Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a unique underworld movie experience. <br /> <br /> Here is the full story: a scientist gets messages from space (a la Independent Day). The messages say things like a massive disaster will soon happen and then the scientist later hears on the radio that a major earthquake has just happened in China. He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world, so he tries to find out who receives the messages (and who also sends messages in space). He and his wife eventually find out that the messages come from a monastery. They visit it. Everything looks normal, including the priest who is played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is lenient and really believes the messages come from and go to that monastery. So he and his wife go secretly back to the monastery where they are trapped by strangers, disguised as priests and nuns. They are being held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need to return them to their planet. As soon as the stranger gets the special element, the aliens all leave one by one to their home planet in a sort of packaged transport platform. Lee, who is the last stranger, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed due to a kind of hokey decision by strangers. Lee walks into the carrier and he is gone. The couple, watching the monitors showing footage of natural disasters around the world, decide to follow the strangers. Because the earth is doomed, the couple see no point to stay behind, so they run into the carrier and disappear. The last shot of the movie is a planet earth that explodes. The end. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a dim movie in my life. This is the most underworld movie I've ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are two of the worst heroes or protagonists ever to appear on the screen. They don't care about it. They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide "what is the heck, who needs the earth anyway?" They don't even try to stop or do anything to make things better. This kind of story would have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of punishment for everything, but the action and atmosphere was inconsistent. The actors and the people behind this dull movie go through their steps, so much so that you can almost feel when they hit their cards when they left and returned to work. I didn't expect much from this movie because it's a Charles Band production, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. <br /> <br /> Once asked what was his worst movie ever made, Christopher Lee calls STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining. END OF THE WORLD is very, very, very worst: it is beyond dull and inert, with no entertainment value whatsoever.
