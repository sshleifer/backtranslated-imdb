A horrible movie! It must have acted against some real stinkers nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first known female Renaissance painter and made it unrecognizable. My complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts; If the story was good, it would be perfectly good. But it's simply bizarre. The true story of this artist would have made a much better movie anyway, so why did they show up on this dishwater-dull script? I think there were not enough naked people in the factual version. It ended in a hurry with a summary of the artist's life - we could have saved ourselves for a few hours if they benefited the rest of the movie with the same shortness.
