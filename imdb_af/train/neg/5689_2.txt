Over the past year, your Boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker who is the capable "In the Name of the King" (a "Lord of the Rings" clone) and the proud vulgar, post-9/11 satire "Postal. "But then came" Seed "and the counter was reset to Zero, keeping its bid for legitimacy and reaching it far beyond. And I'm a fan of the man? His films show a unique screw vision, and never sow. <br /> <br /> From his wilderness frustration, his early films were received, "Seed" is a tremendously wrong attempt to make social commentary, and an even worse jab to create an iconic slasher mythology . (Boll often looks like a page of Rob Zombie's successful Halloween recharge). The antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a stupid killer who killed 666 people and is sitting on the dead row waiting for execution. After he had not fried the animal successfully, he rose from the grave to take revenge on those who settled there ... and so a string of completely bold chaos begins. <br /> <br /> Try a new millennium shooter The Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees bait, Max Seed, is too indescribable and boring to give an impression, ultimately on a succession of equally boring victims Looks like an excited pro wrestler doing the Toolbox Murders. In addition, Seed's character and Boll's "message" run counter to each other: the death penalty is wrong, sure, but are we really expected to sympathize with a sultry killer who has left a few hundred bodies in his aftermath? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts like a lethargic, lost brother of James Remar's character on "Dexter": a policeman who sits at his desk immersed in newspaper cuttings. look at pointless stop scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in Seed's Lair. By the time he and a lot of cardboard cops storm seed's hiding place, the order is so exhausted, poorly understood (the lighting is almost non-existent) and unaware (despite a healthy dose of gore) that it is almost my place to sleep. <br /> <br /> The clumsy movie entertainment is not limited to just that sequence: "Seed" seems to have been shot by a drunk filmographer, as the camera bobs and endlessly weaves, a technique that is more gastric than the gore itself; These protracted tasks of very little attention only pay attention to the winding, almost non-existent story. At 90 minutes, the film is enough to be considered a form of torture, which could have been Boll's intention long ago. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I think the joke is on me.
