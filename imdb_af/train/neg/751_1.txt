I honestly believe that anyone considering the movie will be subject to this staggering failure. Like the films of Edward Wood, Jr. In the '60s and' 70s, this film is a brilliant example of why real filmmakers spend so much energy recognition, reviewing their movies, and reworking their special effects until they finally look right. This movie is also a decent argument for the studio's preliminary process. As Mr. Hines was forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, if he could cut 75% or walk / walk / walk scenes and bring this movie into a more portable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Film students should see this movie as an example of how dangerous their work is, can really be. Each display, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every frame of video, indicates the danger of striving for mere mediocrity. An early film maker may question him / her from time to time to think: "At least I have achieved something" or "It will just be an achievement in itself". This movie will help them understand how bad a movie can come out. <br /> <br /> Critics can also benefit from the movie before being the latest summer entertainment "the worst movie ever made". <br /> <br /> Beginning writers can learn from this movie just how important rewriting is, and perhaps understand the need for rewriting. Also, starting principles can teach the importance of a GOOD script, and some respect for how difficult it is to write a script that forces the audience emotionally through the story. Writers and directors who watch bad piano movies of the week and think "I can do better than that" can get an idea from this movie how hard it really is to produce even mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to start filmmakers. Especially those entering the vessel in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg area. There are reason filmmakers like this are welcomed for their ability with special effects. The World War clearly illustrates that not everyone can pull it. Some may not even come to it.
