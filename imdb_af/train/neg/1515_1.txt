I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the decisive Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. It was one of the WORST movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never posted online before, but this movie was so terrible that I had to do it. I think the problems start with the writing that was so amateurish, it is incredible. The story makes no sense and the dialogue is so urgent that it is misleading. Poor Gears, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere / Danes on the screen matchup, due to the terrible writing, one does not believe some character for a single minute. I bet he could buy the negative, was something possible. It is a pity that talent is so badly wasted, not to speak, I wish I could get back 2 hours. (I know what you think. How do I really feel?)
