Well, I was excited to first download an animated open source movie just to be destroyed by a demo line. The animation is excellent, the lip sync is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on, just to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, just a pity that the creators are wasting their time. I saw short movies with twice the emotion in half the time! It could be an excellent short film if they took the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone at Blender is excited to showcase their software and delivery skills, but sorry guys storytelling is what makes a movie.
