I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's actually funny in a very valuable way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely horrible, I mean he just can't act. He must give up now, since acting is clearly not his thing. His co-stars are about the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do better than anyone! The director must be ashamed to put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this man. <br /> <br /> I've never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad, I was forced to do it. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to watch this movie, don't be 0/10 if there is a 0
