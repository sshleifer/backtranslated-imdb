I'm ashamed to write this review. I say this because those of you reading it will know that I am sitting all over the thing and it is embarrassing to even admit to strangers. But I just had to warn those who read the viewer comment on IMDb before looking at a movie not to watch this one. That's the least I can do. It's a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is goofy. The acting is amateurish. And directing, camera work, sets, costumes, etc. Are all second rate. Let it go.
