Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, come back for this very small Universal Horror offer. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comic sidekick "Babe", we get Fuzzy Knight as a stupid comedy called "Stuff". But the results aren't as charming anywhere, and the fright is almost zero. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of ​​finding a treasure hunt on a remote island in a haunting old castle. Peggy is one of the gangs coming together for the ride. But there is a long and thin John Carradine lookalike in a black cap and a big hat known as the "Phantom" that crashes the party into the pursuit of the buried fortune. <br /> <br /> This "phantom" is not very secretive, and no attempt is made to shade even its formerly average face to create tension or haunting. It is always nice to see Moran, but otherwise you can get it as one of Universal's memorable misconceptions.
