The animation in this remake of Peter and the Wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes the film is sleep-inducing. They had to call it "Peter & the Snails" because everything is moving in the pace of a snail. I couldn't even see the movie in one seat - I had to see it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - don't see this movie - and you'll thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the category Best Animated Short (short!), Voters will have to sit down the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and have to predict that there is no way to win this film close.
