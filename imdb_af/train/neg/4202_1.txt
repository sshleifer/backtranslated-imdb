... did I miss something here? "unexpected plot developments"? "plot turn with subversive glee"? see these viewers the same Arquette vehicle that I have exposed myself (in a now-obvious sub (un) aware of sadomasochism). I just joined this site to make sure nobody else is renting this stinker. .. this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved ... quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before giving the thumb to Kate C? If so, it must be the same Spielberg that made the "howard the duck" green ... don't give it to me, "it was a hit", I advise Mssr. Reddin is not too satisfied ... the DVD cover promised "surprising angles" and a "twisted story ..." Story !! Story ?? It's such a bit as Bobby McKee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like brilliant ... Sundance ?? Berlin ?? Toronto? I have a home video of my cat flight that causes more interest than Arquette's negative-dimensional depiction of anxiety loss ... and talks about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T .; Thank you, just in time he thought Dave called the police! and thank you Shiva that the police just caught the real killer ... what !!! To the credits I still waited for it to be a kind of grift against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you don't escape unharmed: what was the kitchen scene with the "athlete's foot in my cross" gag ??? are you worse in this or "just cause" ?? I don't know ... he movie lovers: why don't you make it a firmer night and rent it with 'sweater girl' and 'white chicks' then commit sepukka (or is it seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
