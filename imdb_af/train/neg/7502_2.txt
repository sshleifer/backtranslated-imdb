I always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I expected more from Son from Sam and instead got a movie that has very little to do with the 1977 murders. The talking dog was laughing (you know you're in trouble when all the movie people laughed improperly). The whole movie was very diverse and not very interesting. The sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, but it should have a point (unless it's a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort !!
