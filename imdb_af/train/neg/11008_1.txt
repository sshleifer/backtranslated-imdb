I bought it at tower records after seeing the information merit about fifteen hundred times at the comedy center. I was really looking forward to watching it. My god, where did I go wrong?

With that said, the underground comedy film is up there with the worst movie I've ever seen. I tried to give it a chance, but it wasn't just funny. It didn't make any sense, didn't insult it at all and was stupid everywhere. God who thought of these good thoughts was funny? it goes right to the bottom of the bin ...
