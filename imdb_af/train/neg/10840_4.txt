I happened to grow the show, along with millions more. So I agreed to this movie, think it is not good, it can be at least a little bit spectacular and fun. <br /> <br /> TRAFFIC! I just wonder. In the end, was Charlie's Angels so boring? I can't remember it as such. But this movie, as bad as movies of this type, can be more or less similar to the excitement of that period and show. I saw it all, despite the negatives, it was not unshakable. But it was very thin, which I do not at all blame the artists, especially the women who played the angels, as they really look like them. The movie was just not that interesting. It tried to make every angel a "character". (One angel is dirty, one is the "good girl", one is in her husband ...). All characters are portrayed with one important feature that defines them and a little depth above stereotypes. The excitement of the show was lacking and the dialogue was .... dialogue. It's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not the worst of TV movies. But abusive.
