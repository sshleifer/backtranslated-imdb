I bought this video at Walmart's $ 1 bin. I think I paid too much! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of three-quarter films for small studios (in this case Monogram - those who made most of the Bowry Boys movies). While the misery of most of these films does not reach the level of dreadfulness, his latest films (Ed Wood's "classic" like the Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from outer space) have their poor films and should be avoided by all but the hardest fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie junkie, so I tried it. In addition, some of these smaller films were actually pretty good - just not these. <br /> <br /> What else, Lugosi is a crazy scientist who wants to keep his bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he comes from young brides. They never really explained why they had to be brides, or why they should be women or even the illness that his wife had - so you can see that the plot was never really overlooked. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a very annoying female reporter (a Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to come down to all these apparent murders in which the bodies are stolen! So she follows a few clues to the door of Lugosi. Lugosi's home is complete with his crazy wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hug-face and a dwarf). Of course, this soft reporter disappears repeatedly throughout the film - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Eventually, the maniacs ALL die - mostly because of their own hands and everything is fine. In conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she recently met have decided to marry. And of course, the reporter's dumb cameraman fails when that happens. If you haven't noticed, there is a lot of faint in this movie. Or, perhaps because it was such a slow and tremendous movie, they just fell asleep!
