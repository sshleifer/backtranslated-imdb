Don't waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about some travelers caught in a cave). So, we decided to see it anyway, think it can't be that bad. It was. I can't believe this movie was actually produced and sent out to the public. It was so terrible that it was almost like an accident scene where you wanted to look away, but you just can't make yourself. I feel honestly emotional scars. It's been a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl is assaulted by a boy, who is taking part in an all-out porn movie. And really not a good one. I hated the woman's rapist to feel almost bad for him. Almost. All in all, a horrible movie that definitely was rated NC-17 for a reason. Don't waste your money. And don't let your kids see it.
