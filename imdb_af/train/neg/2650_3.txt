While submitting to this TV mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this garbage? The film uses meaningless, confronted plot lines to deliver garbage to thousands of homes. The film takes a political agenda on a new level. The movie was meaningless, and all creditworthiness was lost for the excessive use of stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton was trying to make this movie worthwhile, but eventually she must remember the old saying that you can't polish a maze. I hope you didn't waste your New Year's Day and watch another thought made for TV movies. I now know why the networks were on the air on Sunday night to escape our garbage!
