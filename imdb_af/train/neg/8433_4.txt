Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts accordingly. His life is completely boring and he doesn't know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He felt completely empty and decided to go out to get drunk. When he comes home, he falls with a girl who places ads. Although she ignores him, he falls in love and begins to follow her obsessively. Well, the beginning of the movie is a bit slow, and can be boring for most people. But if the action starts, it's a little better (not much! Perhaps the best part is the 5 minute sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) you can see in the middle of the movie, it's not good For eroticism, but for the funny and unexpected it is the scene, probably the best of the movie, not the actors or the director is good, and the results are a boring movie that can be funny to some people. me.) All the film is based on absurd situations (idiot, like the movie says), which has something interesting. I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit it's not one of his best movies (maybe his worst!), He knows better to do it.
