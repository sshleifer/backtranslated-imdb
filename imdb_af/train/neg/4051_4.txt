Lindsay Anderson was a European filmmaker, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker made spectacular films in visual scope. Anderson's film is more about social commentary and subtext, so much so that the message ends up over the whole movie whose primary function is to entertain the audience <br /> <br /> What you think of IF comes down to what you think of British filmmakers think. I very much believe that cinema should be a universal medium. (The best Brit movie makers are those who, in my opinion, are trying to emulate Hollywood). If you want to send a message, try pony explicitly, and I find the movie dated, pretentious, and set in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student uprising in France. You can only imagine that every French French left hand worships this film especially the climax. French new wave filmmakers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but a mainstream international will not like it, and many will not like it much.
