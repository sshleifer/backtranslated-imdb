For the love of God, please do not see this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, just like the romantic scenes. Try to build too much with very little, this movie and its evil predictable villain is just lame. The characters are not being developed, and most of the films are expelled with shots from Rome, which is much more interesting than the real film. To top it all off, the play is a shame. I know everyone is trying to find their niche, but it's really a disaster. I can't believe anyone actually paid a lot of pounds to put this movie on the screen. Don't waste money or time on this movie, go see your grandmother or something worth it.
