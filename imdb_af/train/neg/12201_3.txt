The summary summarizes it all. It is nowhere as good as the original. With a writing written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he also writes Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was physically physical as he made it, and Rocky 4 and he looked good or ripped up. to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go for a special mission that can earn him a presidential pardon. He eventually agrees and goes to the information camp played by Charles Napier, and plays a Washington suit to beat him as former ex-powers to bother Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if any missing POWs are still in the camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen because the camp he was checking out was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself. He said it was not a rescue mission, and he was there just to take reconstructions. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt to parachute from an airplane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (which turns out to be a cute woman) and travels along the river with pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He still finds prisoners and saves one. As the 3 half of the Vietnamese army flee on their riverboat, they are betrayed by the pirates, but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to go up to the pick-up point on foot after their boat with Rambo almost ran and inflated . on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is again betrayed and abandoned if Napier commands the revocation of the rescue helicopter. It is clear if Trautman returns to the base to reprimand that no survivors are expected. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as a Russian Spetznatz colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escaped just to be pursued. Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Rambo kills many of them, and Rambo eventually steals a helicopter and saves most prisoners back to his base. <br /> <br /> He resists the urge to kill Napier to abandon him, but destroys the Ops Center. <br /> <br /> A poor plot and very poor end as Rambo leaves as a free man in the sunset.
