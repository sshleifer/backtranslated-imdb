I thought any horror movie with Orson Welles would be strange in it. Necromancy was sure, but it was a bit odd because it was good. The movie does have a terrible feeling when it comes to a covenant of satanists / witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. However, the director intentionally tries to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream series. Against the final, there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse, since the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters. It seems strange that Welles will agree to head this movie, especially because he doesn't have much to do. Perhaps one day they will bring out a band of outtakes and bloopers from this movie. Now it would be really fun!
