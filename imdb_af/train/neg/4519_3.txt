Three Stooges - Got Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film to die for the Stooges and it's pretty bad. It makes the THREE STUDIES THAT WORLD IN A DAZE (from 1963) look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Stooges is a clover on a rocket. They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus. They meet a few things there, including a unicorn they call "Uni" that brings them to Earth with them. "Uni" talks like an average, pleasant person - "Oh, hello. How are you? Beautiful planet here. Hope you like it. " Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many screens just go on and on and on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges come back from space and the film is gone as far as The Story goes, but no one told the filmmakers that the picture lasts another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much does not happen. The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over. <br /> <br /> High point of the movie - the end where the Stooges sing a brave song about their journey. The Larry and Kruller Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another author mentioned the fine musical score. Huh? The only music I even noticed was two classic songs. I will take romance and both are played at the party. And * it's really the highlight of the picture - music from old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The tall, sexy blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 cents store.
