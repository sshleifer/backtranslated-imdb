Really bad shot at video "movie" made by none, not two, but three amateur video makers. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a bad horror movie, throw in some blood, gore and nudity. There is a bit of latex cut blood, and drugs are bought at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex. The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but just talk. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no machining effects, fading, wiping, etc. A bit of black sometimes appears a bit off the scene. <Br /> <br /> Terrible music by poor heavy metal tires whose websites take up most of the end credits. The werewolves are represented by rubber masks attached to the "actors" face. They didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee a 10-year-old with a video camera, can bring a better movie. No need to buy, rent or watch this movie except as an example of how not to make a low budget video.
