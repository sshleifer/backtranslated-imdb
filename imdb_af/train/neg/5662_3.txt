When I read most of the other comments, I felt they were too glowing for this movie. I have found that it has completely lost the spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just proves that after a long absence of screen, it is often best to leave things alone. I totally agreed with the Star Trek analog of another reviewer comparing the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series --- millions of excited fans are waiting and waiting for the return of the show and had to be forced to A mere and sterile look approach of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly greedy (though the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much more bloody) and the heart of the original shortcoming. I did not see the blood at all, but some can be switched off (especially the cut off nose and cut heads). In addition, the time was not good for Ichi - he looks like a broken and sad man in this movie (much more than usual) - and that is something that fans of the series may not really want to see. <br /> <br /> It was a very unfortunate return for Zatoichi. Unless you're like me and want to see every Zatoichi movie, this one is very easy to hit. See one of the previous versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version.
