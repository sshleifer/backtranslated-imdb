This movie is not only bad, not just corny, it is repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the creepy call girl, across the damn (and I use the word literally) film radiates a grotesque query that would offend a brothel mistress. This film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bother me most about this movie is that they have used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the Clich√© Worst Nightmare and the exaggerated Wrewed Wish, is a truly fascinating movie idea. Think: The reason why hobgoblins should be murdered before that day is that they are attracted to bright lights. During the day, bright lights are not well displayed, so they can go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Count the Hobgoblins: Four hobboblins ride from the movie studio, and at least nine of the harmful plush toys are killed during the movie. <br /> <br /> Discussion Question: If you had an avid, demanding, unpleasant girl, would you enter into a tumbling-line battle with a military lump? Explain.
