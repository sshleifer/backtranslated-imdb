After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to sleep, I decided that I could have fun while sleeping. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here's the plot (potential spoilers, if you even care): A neurotic man with an addiction to candy (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp to a ridiculous company. Suddenly he is given the chance to "go perm", which seems to be the favorite catch of this movie. But with a safe job and a secure income within his grasp, Josh decides for any stupid reason he doesn't want to. He hopefully hopes several small tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send a few "very important" letters within a given time is supposed to be hilarious, but is just stupid. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer's wife and they hit in bed together (of course Josh's fantasy in real life, because such a thing will never happen). A lot of other things are happening, but it's too foolish and going in to go. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie is being charged as a comedy, I just laughed twice there; The first time was Josh Kornbluth's opening shot (my initial reaction was one of the choking of fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the handsome woman (yes right). Josh Kornbluth may be the scariest person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, naked Jewish man I'm supposed to believe, having sex with beautiful women. I have no sympathy with Josh's character. He is lazy and unmotivated and I do not appreciate the failed attempts to appreciate humor. Save it, even if your life depends on it.
