I really can't believe this movie is not in the IMDB worst 250, it's absolutely horrible. When I originally saw it, I remember about it in a college class and two other people also saw it. We all told other class members not to see it, because it was so terrible. By the time we were finished, others just wanted to see it because they couldn't believe it, as bad as we said. Don't be like them, just adjust it. I'm sure everyone involved in this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie.
