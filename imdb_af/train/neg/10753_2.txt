Del - "You're the dumbest smart person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in writing." <br /> <br /> I think what I find the most turbulent about this bastardization of Asimov's work is how the character of Susan Calvin is portrayed. In the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists to think of her through a problem. Here she is just a girl in need and waiting to be saved by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are references to Asimov's Robots laws, but they are a reminder of CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is nice, as he is in most of his films, but frankly the story isn't that good. You refine it long before these genius characters do.
