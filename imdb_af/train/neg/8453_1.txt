This movie is a turbulent mish-mash clich√©s from recent theater. There are some promising ideas there, but while the director was clearly aiming to make a haunting ambiguous movie, it was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but with no central theme, he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely without scarecrows (though, in fairness, there are a few creepy moments). <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of alienated twin, diabolic librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by anger monkeys, oedipal conflict, offensive stepfathers, subsidized homosexuality and crime gang connections. The only true communality that these elements share is that they express the protagonist with a vague sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this movie is that, although the brother's death by monkeys appears heavily on the DVD cover, the act itself is not portrayed directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror story, watch Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
