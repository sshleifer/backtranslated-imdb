Permitted, it looks like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and you'll find out. <br /> <br /> In truth, Martin, the lead, was displeased. He doesn't do the big slapstick of which he is known, of movies like "The Jerk", but rather plays a kind of character that doesn't work. Hawn, with no one to play, is terrible. Cleese is the only even partially funny member. <br /> <br /> To download it, the plot is pretty stupid. I can't say how much of it could be changed, but the characters seem to have the slightest bit of common sense. They blow through New York, do nothing right, and unfortunately nothing funny. Not only is the whole point of view totally unbelievable, it seems that the message is that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, instead To see it, the original "Odd Couple" will be rented again.
