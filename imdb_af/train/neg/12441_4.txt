Some things need to be explained. The picture of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris that played in this movie. I know this because he was my dad. Please remove the picture. Also, Mark Ferris was the author, at least one of them. I tried a copy or a way to see this movie again. It is years and if anyone can point me towards obtaining a copy, it would be great. The movie was not that bad, and is trying to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other high-tech scientists. If you see it, just enjoy the reasonableness and humor it owns. Lighten up on movie snobs and enjoy less creative and innovative movies.
