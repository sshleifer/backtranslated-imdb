Thomas Clay mixes with the wrong types. It's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and sturdier and ambitions for the drug mad ends as if it is no longer better, as it is director. We are introduced to the main title character who is a little outsider, we see him at school and not quite fit in at home, feeling uncomfortable in himself as so many adolescents do. Robert falls in with bad guys and starts going to school and using drugs and before you know it, he is a psychosocialist. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clay's total failure to understand the links between violence and violent acts. . Clay seems to think that a generation of crazy youths are angry with scenes of war on our TVs. Yet he filmed the most disgusting piece of simulated violence. Is this man the right one? <br /> <br /> If Clay didn't see YouTube, might he be naive and unaware that he's going to do the movie with his brutal climax? Everyone who wants to see is the frightening scene of the end of the movie and I'm sure it will stick to people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is useless because it plays such a violent role in rolling Clay. Not only the young people who are actively involved in the prevention of war, he also condemns him as an offender of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Disgrace to everyone involved.
