How much more of the false "cuts of life" movies should be made? Hopefully not too much. <br /> <br /> Increasing Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious effort by director Peter Solett to draw Hollywood's attention. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is particularly wrong with this film is that it ignores the audience and piles on every click in the book of so-called "edgy" Hollywood independent production. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be "actually" so the camera "documentary style", except that no documentary would shake the camera deliberately. <br /> <br /> It's "edgy" so don't waste any time lighting the movie. <br /> <br /> It's "hip", so let's use the kids to use swords like Al Pacino in Scarface. <br /> <br /> And so on, and so forth. All you have left is a very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood that no one will impress outside of the "rarefied" india crowd that still seems to be on every bad movie.
