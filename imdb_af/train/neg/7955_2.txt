Carrie Fisher said on more than one occasion that she made this movie during her life when she had a serious cocaine problem, and she didn't remember much about it. This will explain why she made this movie, but it doesn't explain why someone else was in the throw or crew; I can't believe everyone has a cola problem. It must be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and it says something. The blame cannot be laid at the feet of director Tim Kincaid or "author" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is clear that this photo was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently it just got spontaneous, because there is little evidence of coherence, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. What is really great is that there were real professionals involved with this glop. Mrs. Robert Joy did good work in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and film maker Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks was also a director and not bad. Why they got involved in this steaming waste stack is sensible. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director", has made quite a few sci-fi and horror movies with low rent, and after seeing most of them, I can tell you that none of them is good. However, this one is by far the worst he has ever done, and that is a great achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is 12th-rate - at its best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughing, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is trite, derivative and stupid. Don't waste your time, even look at the video box cover, let alone rent it. A complete, total, annoying, total dud.
