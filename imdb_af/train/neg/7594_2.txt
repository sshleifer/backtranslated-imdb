Given the history of the director of this movie, it's hard to believe it's such a painful bad movie to go through. I was at the European Premiere last night and one of the Executive Producers was there. He was still watching the movie and, son, he was in a surprise. I did not read the book on which it is based, nor did it know if it was highly rated or valued, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and gave it how bad it was for the screen and how bad this movie was . Just imagine that something similar has happened here. The acting wasn't bad, though there were a few too many Farrell eyebrows. Honestly, I can't believe how little I care about any character in this movie. Situations play on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. Donald Sutherland's part consists of a few scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I watched my watch when I didn't cut the dialogue on the screen. I've never walked out on a movie, but I was tempted to start it. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons that look terribly shallow to me, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoy the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek is naked and looks pretty. I can say something else positive about this movie. Don't ask the dust anything, it can't speak!
