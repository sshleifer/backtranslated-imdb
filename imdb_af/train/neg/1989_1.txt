I'd like to give this movie, but it wasn't an option !! This movie sucks !!! The women can't act. I had to know it was going to suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe I didn't change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as rifle members in Western days is ridiculous. It's not just a race, it's also a generation. the combination of the two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry that some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was terrible. It wasn't credible as a movie. It may be a "group" for a certain group of people, but I'm not in that group. lol. and with a good line of a great, fantastic movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
