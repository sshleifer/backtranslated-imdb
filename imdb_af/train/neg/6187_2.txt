It was a terrible disappointment briefly. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was awfully awkward; I couldn't feel any sense behind the words of the characters. The lines are too fast and feel rather out of place. They can just as well be quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York did not exist and made an American Rochester feel strange. At least he could have tried to do a British accent. I love George C. Scott as an actor, but it just didn't work. I felt like I had Jane Jane's highlights, where the chapters of the story were randomly composed, without looking at the flow of the story. The scenery and music were all very nice, but I couldn't feel the passion and love that was supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the film left me completely uninhabited. <br /> <br /> If you're a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you look at the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these are two brilliant adjustments.
