Typical formula action movie: A good police word is entangled in a mess of crooked police and Japanese gang members. <br /> <br /> The cute result has proper performances, a few brief snicker-inducing moments and some fair action. plus a chance to watch the beautiful Danielle Harris - who makes the most of her eternal typing as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** from ****.
