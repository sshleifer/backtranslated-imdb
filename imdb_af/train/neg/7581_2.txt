I saw this movie in a film school the other day, and I have never seen an Almodovar movie, but believed it would be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a senseless movie with just a few laughs mixed with two hours of pure boredom. High heels are just a collection of random scenes that may have worked in their own separate movies, but do not add to any kind of meaningful whole. <br /> <br /> I thought so. Then my film professor published the next class throughout the day explaining all the hidden details of the movie, such as how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is a kind of commentary on the lack. to identity that Spain developed as a nation among the fascist government. Apparently the whole movie is full of clever, small visual tricks and references like this. <br /> <br /> Big, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. Making a good movie requires more than depth and complexity - you have to give the audience another reason to pay attention, something to interest the viewer to really take care of all the subtle tricks. High heels give us strange characters, but keep them in mostly everyday situations that are recovered from other movies, and Almodovar doesn't seem to use it to make any point. What is the meaning, for example, of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that takes place at the end of the movie? Why is it even there? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is one funny scene dealing with a news broadcast. And that's it, it's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just nonsense cinematic references and visual clues that seem to exist only to show us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than a self-denial for a movie to be good.
