Basic slasher movie premise, 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up with a creepy family. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Look for 36 minutes of OJ's car hunt with a white sedan instead of a bronco. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN <br /> 23 minutes to watch the actors eat - YAWN Try to identify how well they eat ... OK, there may be a drinking game here ... no - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK, I have my interest for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Totally random and uninspired murders ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The end ... oh! that psycho is confused - why can't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes. Unfortunately, this - my advice - is fast after the last five minutes and then looks at something good in the player - for me I go back to sleep.
