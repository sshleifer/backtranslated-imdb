"Darkness" was to some degree entertained, but it never seemed to be a plot, but one less than other films accused of this disadvantage; ie "bad taste". It started very well, with a man running off something. It was very creepy for the first few minutes, but after a while the movie was just gore entertaining. It was difficult to make some points difficult due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality. The movie was hard to believe because of the youthful acting, which seemed most of the time like some friends talking to a video camera, and made lines as they went. This, with no plot whatsoever, made it seem like the movie started without a script. As mentioned earlier, Gore was the only sign of the film, which was hard to figure out much of the time.
