While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. They have taken many freedoms to rearrange events, with the exception of people, and the use of sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30s. There were several times more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in the gang, and the people had so much to do with the facts as included. Buck and Blanche convinced Clyde to go straight ahead much earlier than the one shoot, and was actually withdrawn from crime. Some of the events depicted in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much worse and never properly healed. It was so bad that she had to be turned around until it healed, and even then it stiffened so she walked tight. Clyde also walked with a slack, because in prison he cut off a big tone. I know, I'm picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this "TRUE" story, the movie moves too fast from event to meeting, and it comes across more than different separate snapshots of their lives. rather than being a coherent flowing story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
