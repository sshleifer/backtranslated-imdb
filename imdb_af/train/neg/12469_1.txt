Rarely do I go to a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true if I rented it on DVD. Syria was one I gave up. Halfway I bored it in bored aversion. <br /> <br /> This movie is unpleasant, boring, confusing and dark. The acting was dry and without credible portrayals. The general plot was good, but so developed and so boring it couldn't understand my attention or interest. The multiple sub-graphs often did not link to each other and looked more like random stories than a real connected plot. Badly such a serious topic and such big actors can create such a flop. I can't believe this movie receives any nominations that are much less a grant.
