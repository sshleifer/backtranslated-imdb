The movie and acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job of playing Calito Brigante, but the film forgets it is supposed to be a prelude to a hit. The creators of this prequel clearly did not look at the original Carlito's Way or at least did not deal with continuity. This movie is a prequel which means that the original film has already explained a history to us and this movie must end where the original begins or at least leads. None of Carlito's old old friends from the original are in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but he plays a very different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Since this movie is less than 5 years earlier, wouldn't you think one of Carlito's long-time friends would look like friends? In the original, Carlito is being released from prison after being in jail for five years. It's just a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the start of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in jail, so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending, it is an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original . What happens to Gail? This is the lack of continuity that made this movie go straight to video release.
