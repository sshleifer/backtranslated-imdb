Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly, his son (Luke Perry) has long been working on the antedote. Fill in the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and start the cat and mouse car hunt and gun fire. Also in the cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore suddenly seems to be moving through this mess, certainly not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will be accepted. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.
