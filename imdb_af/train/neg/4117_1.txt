Two days after I saw this thing, I'm still seeing it. It's so bad, you have to wonder how someone can write these trips, much less leave it to the general public. Stilted acting, a leading man who looks as if he is sleeping, and Alison Eastwood confesses herself. The action indicates the low budget film production, which means it is painfully bad. The storyline? Well, if you were 6, then you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic, and just lame.
