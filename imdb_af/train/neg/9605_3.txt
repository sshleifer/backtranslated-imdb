This Italian movie from the 70's is NOT once in class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even the awful American Werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the main actress, a beautiful blonde, running amok in her birthday pack. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity ... it's obvious she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a hoot, the SFX is childish, and the acting (for the most part) stinks. The only redeeming value of this movie is everything (and there is a LOT) the nudity and sex scene. Themed by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you arrive on a Saturday without a date. OK ... HERE IS THE SPOILER ... There is NO werewolf (except in the opening phase of the heroine (?) S ancestor. The girl just imagines that she is a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
