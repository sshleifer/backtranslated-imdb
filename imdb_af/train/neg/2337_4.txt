I don't know what the hype is about this ... It's really a bad movie ... it didn't do anything to me, the only descent scene is where everyone joins the party and plays a nice song, exciting beats and nice movie shots that let you move. This was the best part of the movie. Otherwise, this movie has nothing to suck the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think as some people say, there is no connection between the different stories ... it was more of an attempt to make Anderson's 'Magnolia' again. It was brilliant, but it blatantly slap ... Well, it's light and easy to look at, but it's also movies. Maybe first write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've seen
