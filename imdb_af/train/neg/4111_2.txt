Think of a non-budget version of China Syndrome directed by a film student who disgusts John Woo and gets you Power Play. The idea was good, but the performance, acting and dialogue absolutely killed it, not mentioning ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster rages used to compensate for the lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie. <Br /> <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group, who have mysteriously missed after breaking into the offices of a power station that is thought to be a madness. of earthquake. The rather cavalier reporter, who was against a more ruthless bunch of company executives, is being rushed by the town (with whom he speaks) to "clean" which can prove conclusive evidence of the factory's faults. br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real emergency, because the characters are very hesitant to work with idiotic dialogue and very horrific acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who can only be attracted to the movie for his action genre appeal, is forced to endure increasing body number and ridiculous amounts of violent shooting emotions and earthquake ramtones. All the focus was placed in the wrong place to apologize for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that would drive the story. It might have been much better if the filmmakers focused more on excitement and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those trying to warn the reporter of the wrong thing. These are formulas, but at least they would be entertaining.
