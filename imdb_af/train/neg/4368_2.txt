It was thrown out by Alpha on the DVD market, and it's just for the hard-headed Boris Karloff fans (like Moi). It's not a horror movie, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist who agrees to kill a rich woman's husband to get the fortune needed to continue his work. But as soon as the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It's enough to see Karloff as another selfish sinister type, and some of the plays are inadvertently hilarious (especially from the leading lady Mona Goya who is absolutely a riot as the double-crossed woman) . <br /> <br /> But be very careful.
