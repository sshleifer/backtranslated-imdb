I like to watch early color films - you mean the 40 clothes weren't all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Her "eccentric" clothes are actually quite attractive and yes, she has a wonderful hourglass figure. But I feel she gave her head too much. She probably developed this characterization over many actions, and no one said to her: "If it laughs, let it out." She overcame how she was supposed to be surprisingly to the earth. The Madame Arcati joke is these mediums usually portrayed as wispy women in long drapery. Arcati behaves like a retired maiden (We'll really put our backs in it!). The contrast between her blue, everyday way and her crazy beliefs is not really brought out. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are English (except Cummings), the Americans feel they are the words "Brit", "Stiff", "Lip" and "Top". Oh, give it a rest! The three main characters are constantly losing their pace and making remarks (Did he love you? Yes, but very discreet - he was in the cavalry!).
