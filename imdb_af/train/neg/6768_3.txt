Herbie, the Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now run by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman hoping to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in her way is current champion Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who does everything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love error was not so good. Even as a child, I don't remember much. However, I had hope for the sequel. I mean the throw is pretty good and the trailer makes it look like a nice movie. Unfortunately Herbie is no better than he used to be. The film is definitely poor for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I realize it's a children's movie and everything, but they could have made the movie a little more interesting. . There was very little laughter and it became boring near the end. Most of the actors were also dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was good as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance from everyone. He was very good as the bad man, though he didn't have much to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are actually there and they do nothing special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and she does a good job. She tries to keep the film interesting, but she works with a poor writing. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would it be a surprise to them that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films but they fail to make the stories really interesting or enjoyable. This is not their fault, but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie worth watching if you are a kid. Everyone else is better off beating it. Rating 4/10
