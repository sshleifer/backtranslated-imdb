Normally, I'm a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this movie I have to say it's incredibly bad. I'm amazed at how positive most reviews seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some beautiful shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on these movie corners. It could have been if 'Daggers' was just a movie and not a romance, but unfortunately the film was built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between any of the couples, and all that looks like between May and May is more like love, and the dialogue is mostly silly. It can only be a problem with translation, but the regular use of the word "flirt" especially reminded me of the 8th grade, not overhead heels, forever together, worthy of death; for love; I also felt that we were hit by the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little attention to the characters who really care, and therefore very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted a remote control to go forward, I was stuck in my seat, but I mostly just got a lot of noise. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, add insult to injury. The end was truly one of the most horrible, laughable I've ever seen. The boys shouted and shouted and shouted and hacked at each other. Oh, and then it starts snowing. Randomly. Oh, and then May (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly appears from the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that takes about 5 minutes to reach the destination, even with a comfortable display to hit a small blood drop. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Well, May finally die, I think, because she throws the dagger filed in her chest and bleed dead. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, the screen becomes empty. Me and the people around me cry. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually astonishing, but ultimately a failure.
