I wanted to have this movie, because the critics were insolent <br /> <br /> (to say the least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Bad <br /> <br /> Acted, a whitish script, a handy direction ... Watch this movie was <br /> <br /> like seeing a car accident - you want to look away but you stare <br /> <br /> because you want to see how messy it will get. Well, the car is <br /> <br /> destroyed and there are no survivors. On the positive side, cinematography was <br /> <br /> nice, I decided to go on vacation, rather than cleaning myself from <br /> <br />
