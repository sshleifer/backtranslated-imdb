Slackers are just another teenage movie that is not really worth watching. Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are about to graduate with Holden University honors in fraud, fraud and twilight. The three roommates have been in college for the past four years and now, during the final exams, these adults on campus are disturbed by the most unlikely man in the school. The plot is very stupid and there is no reason why you should see it unless you want to close your brain for a while. Slackers is just a predictable teen movie that really doesn't add anything new to the genre. The comedy in Slackers is either hit or miss, but there is no real real funny or original moment in the movie. It's really just a collection of gags and some are pretty funny. Although for every joke that works, there are at least eight more that do not. The script is full of penis and breasts that some high school and college students can enjoy. Even if they do, they will probably not remember this movie because it is not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman plays the freaky Ethan and, after appearing in some good comedies, bent quite low. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the other main stars, but they do a bit of poor work in this movie. It's directed by Dewey Nicks and it's his first movie so you can't blame him. The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon, but she's not much in the movie. The movie is very short in just 86 minutes, but it may be too long for some people who don't really like this kind of humor. Slackers is not the worst movie of 2002, but is definitely below average. Compared to other movies in the genre, there are far better things like other teen movie, American Pie and its successors, Scary Movie 1 & 2 etc. So if you haven't seen most of them and you're looking for something new then Slackers can fit that account, but it's better if you just look at something else. Rating 4.3 / 10 a below average teenage comedy that is worth jumping.
