I remember being forced (yes - literally CONTINUED) to see this movie by a South Baptist preacher when I was a child, and even then I loved his horror. It is designed to frighten weak suckers to "be saved." The only thing that saved me was the fact that it eventually ended and I could go out and have a real life. <br /> <br /> Look at the chapter on this movie in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of the Christian Law." Fascinating. And definitely more interesting than the movie!
