Back when I was a child and I lived with my sister, she bought every horror movie she could get and that was one of them. VCR'S has just become a household item and we didn't have more than 150 movies and we looked at hell. <br /> <br /> I was sold on the site the previous day and I saw this VHS. copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie I do not have and I knew this movie is known. I thought for a moment and realized it was one that my sister bought. She sold it many years ago in a garden shop I guess. Who knows. <br /> <br /> I didn't recall anything and I watched it the night I bought and it refreshed my memory because of some scenes. I'm not sure how I felt like a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I want to see anything again. <br /> <br /> I'm a horrorfreak, but there are certain requirements to consider well and this one has become very short. It was one of those talk talk and killed me. What deaths you see is done by using the shade on the wall, followed by blood puffs, and if you're lucky you get so much. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I've seen some with similar plots, so I think this one should be buried and forgotten. Don't see these people unless you're hard.
