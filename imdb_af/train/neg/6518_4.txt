The movie is pretty funny and for about four dates, it becomes a blatant commercial for someone you (and even his "friends") really can't stand. This is a pretty interesting concept; film dates to a search for true love in modern LA. The problem is that it is incredibly (and poorly) sometimes proclaimed and blatantly self-promoting. It's hard to care and is recorded in any of the characters, because the author / actor is so selfish, uncool, untrue, and simply unknowable. You feel sorry for his dates.
