Hello, Everyone, If you've seen "Singing in the Rain," remember Gene Kelly's scene dancing in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make 'em Laugh." If you saw "Royal Wedding," you'll dance to Fred Astaire on the roof. If you saw "Jailhouse Rock", you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by The King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. In this performance there could have been some solid dance numbers. The closest was Chuck McGowan's "I can do it." The mere fact that you have talented people on stage does not make a good dance film. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He showed the camera on stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Screaming at people not auditioning for a part in a Broadway production. Michael Douglas would have been as bad as he was in a Western or a comedy. He's OK when he's in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him screaming for someone we'd like to scream. It doesn't work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good except Michael, of course. A good movie could even be made using the songs that were in stage production, but someone had to think how to roll it. <br /> <br /> Next time they do one of these. I hope they call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
