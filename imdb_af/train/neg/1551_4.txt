The Damesman is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (that is, Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury). Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the most beautiful in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the strip is average and there is only to support Meadows. I definitely saw better movies, but I also saw stupid children. Again, it's not really a deep movie, but it's good for some laughs. However, it was cleaner than a shit. But if you're still looking for a funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Do not think too much, or you will hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
