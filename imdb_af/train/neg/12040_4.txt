I don't know anything about the Iliad, so can't comment on its accuracy. However, as a stand-alone movie I found it very boring. The battle scenes were trying to be big and spectacular, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> The acting is poor and undoubtedly Brad Pitt was just thrown to dress the ladies. But he doesn't make a good fighter, too beautiful, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Good points are the design. This movie looks great with the scenery and castle buildings / walls impressive. I do like a movie that at least tries to accent the characters, but this movie just seems to ignore it. We hear American, Scottish English anything but what you can expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not recommend this movie to a family. It's too long and the young will get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults it is okay if you don't mind the lack of realism.
