I don't know why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think he sees on the screen, let me feel that someone working hard can succeed regardless of talent. It is a good feeling for all of us who have talent. Some of the other reviews indicate how stupid the pastor is, but many fail to point out the positives. <br /> <br /> Any movie where at least one annoying teenager is killed cannot be bad. Why should so many movies that have a teenage movie always include the stereotypical teens? Are there no other teenagers? Does any group of teenagers have an evil black man? A brilliant nerd nobody likes? A malicious girl who is very friendly and pregnant (in this movie)? One disturbed anti-social white child from a broken home that everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?). And a left-over black child that matches the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic children trust him. Then add some generic consumable teens of any color. They don't say much, but are shot at some time. <br /> <br /> Detention would have been better if the bad guys blew up the school. Preferably with the authors. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and girls) eventually chop a bus full of drugs, they sit inside the bus. They drive the bus to school because they want to paint the bus at the school's paint shop, but they never go around to paint the bus. By the way, it would have been easier to put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another bus or truck to drive away without painting the Police Road. They never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score. <br /> <br /> For some reason they decide that they should kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren), although when the villains take over, no one is aware of it, because it is after school hours. The handful of people still in school have nothing to do with the painting of vehicles, so why are they going after them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with various machine guns, and they still keep the teens (including a man in a wheelchair) and they keep hundreds of bullets at the shoot. with the teens and usually miss. At the end of the movie there is bloodshed. Every time someone is shot, at least three hundred dots must be fired and miss. The stunts are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews saying that this movie had a $ 10m budget, and I'm surprised. When I watched the movie, I might have done Lundgren as a kind of charity work for a film school where he was the teacher. As perhaps this movie is their end of the year exam. It was a test to see it, but I succeeded.
