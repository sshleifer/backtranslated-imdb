Don't waste your money on this movie. Don't even get into your car and think you can watch this movie if anyone else doesn't sign in to you. If you have to watch a movie this weekend, watch Batman again. <br /> <br /> The writing was terrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in limited spaces, a crazy man with various weapons, a peculiar man who manages to uncover all the clues that honest police officers can't assemble, and an innocent and exaggerated, but beautiful and strong wife with whom many in the audience would like to call their friend. Mix together, add very poorly executed gore, and whatever the hell, let's bring in some freaks there for a little "spin" to the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, and the characters were incredible - Borat was more credible than that. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can someone please tell me how a butcher's jacket can make a ricochet bullet from the person after he was shot without even the person being shot. let flinch ??? I'm in the army. We need those kinds of things for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I'll put it in the decimals of that round to give the lowest possible score I can.
