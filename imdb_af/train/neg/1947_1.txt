I'm 17, and I still love most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990's movies, and recently we've been treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo trips of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I didn't expect so well. Anyway, back to get an idea! I watched a few episodes, and expected something very good, but from what I saw it, I was not at all impressed. First, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and many Saturday morning cardboard standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even a few shows that I really hate had a little better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like strangers, and I missed Fred, Velma and Daphne because they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positive. I also hated the character changes, as it seemed to have solved puzzles, Shaggy and Scooby were now superhero, something they would never have done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo. Where are you? Show. The theme song was also not very good, I can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and confronted. Although I acknowledge that there is a very talented cast, if they had better material and were not said to sound so different from the original voices as humanly possible, what they did, I might add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was terrible, and I didn't try to discredit it, that's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
