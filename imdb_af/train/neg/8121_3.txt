Time is precious. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who are raving about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater is packed and everyone has had the same reaction. Is this the movie over which the critics overwhelmed? What a crap! <br /> <br /> The hook of this movie is the upward mobile black daughter looking for her white refuse family. <br /> <br /> The production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minute story. The characters are shallow and unintelligible. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not find out about each other blatantly before the audience; The audience mumbled on the screen that the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun doing the laundry.
