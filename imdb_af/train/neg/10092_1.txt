Serious crappy movie. <br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with a policeman and his partner parked outside a warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" policeman takes a girl, who has covered them, in the warehouse's attic, while the newbie is sitting outside thinking what can happen. The "bad" police chief finally came back with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie police didn't think there were any problems, but he was still wondering what was in the bag. He asks, gets a bullshit response, and then he thinks everything is OK (for now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit-scene (made it slightly better). But eventually people started, who took a while because of how f *** ing was obvious. One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her, just as she dies, as you do. Now, the "bad" policeman eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffel bags. <br /> <br /> Ever since she had the oogey boogey magic on her, she comes back with lots of eyeshadow, which is supposed to indicate she can be a zombie ... also causing the magical curse that all the other girls become "eye shadow monsters". Some of the girls meet a man who believes a currency specialist is, and he offers them a ride (they seem to be normal to him). But when the girls see other people, like the one girl man, he freaks because she is scary (some people freak out, but others don't even see) .... massive plot hole. <br /> <br /> To create this, the eye shadow monsters kill the "bad" policeman, who in turn eventually becomes a zombie in the last scene. It was like trying to prepare us for a sequel! As anyone wants to see, part 2 of this cow falls.
