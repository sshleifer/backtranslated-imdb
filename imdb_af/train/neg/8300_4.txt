It's a name-only sequel to "A Christmas Story," originally titled "A Summer Story." In the summer, Ralphie tells his family adventures when they have moved to a small booth in the middle of nowhere.

I was sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is given a bit to do, everything is the formula, and you have to wonder why they even bother. <br /> <br /> And I mean, come on - a competition with spin tops? Unfortunately, this is the best part of the movie ...
