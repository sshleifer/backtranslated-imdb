Well-known writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to overcome old addictions and start a new life for himself, as a publisher of Baltimore, Maryland. But blackouts, delirium and rejection threaten to weaken his efforts. He also wants a romantic revival with an old darling, a considerable flawed prospect, as it turns out. Mr. Redfield also addressed this dramatization of Edgar Allen Poe's mysterious last days. Redfield uses very black and white, color and trick photography to create mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (like Dr. John Moran) performed well, relatively speaking. It is not enough.
