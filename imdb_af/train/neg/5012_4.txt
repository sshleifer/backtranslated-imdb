I watched this movie because Amber Benson rock and Nick Stahl are generally pretty cool. I thought any movie with two actors I love and respect could not be bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the dialogue they got, they both did pretty well. Not good enough to stop the movie from sucking, but you understood it well, but good enough that I could make the 75-year-old movie movie (and that's the main sign of a horrible movie. Pray already that it's over. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start with the problems in "Taboo". The dialogue, as mentioned, is terrible; wood and completely unnatural. January Jones' play is incredibly bad, and since she is the character we spend most of our time, it's an unforgivable mistake. The plot can be so complicated that it doesn't make sense, while at the same time being so clear that it is completely predictable. (Literally, none of the most important "twists" in this movie will surprise anyone other than a toddler). A few interesting shots aside, the director is trying too much success with too much success, awkward tracking and frightening camera work that derives from what little element of the story is there. <br /> <br /> Three of this movie's stars were awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the latter was thrown on the grounds that one of the jokes sniffed me. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
