It's just awful, really awful trash. Yes, we have beautiful, naked women dancing and having sex. But while it might work in the mechanism of a porn movie? Can even be a hit as a porn movie? It tries to mask itself as a "movie" with real things to say, with true emotion and struggle. It's not. It's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time. I'm sure all these women (and men) in this particular movie could be fair in the 1970s porn movie business. . . but not in the actual movie business. <br /> <br /> The acting was hacked, so bad, I actually mean terrible. The writing was even worse. I can't fault all these actors ?? they had nothing to work with. The very broad structure or plot of the movie can possibly be done with good writers and competent actors. The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar, as a sniper. This shooting is motivated by men who do not fully respect their wives. If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less free sexual images, we might have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie had already been shot, made and marketed by a hardcore porn movie. ; it would have made more money. It's almost a hardcore porn movie, and it remains the only non-porn movie I've seen showing a male upright penis.
