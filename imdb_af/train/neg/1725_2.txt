- The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. Unknown to the locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant greenhouse. You guessed it, the egg shells that a dinosaur releases that terrorize the community. <br /> <br /> - What's the best rubbish. It's not that I have the stop-motion clay dinosaur in mind, it's all about the movie that bothered me. The play is horrible. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but comic. Logic does not exist. Any similarity between the "scientists" in this movie and a real scientist is purely coincidental. I can go on forever about the bad aspects of this movie, but you get the idea. I feel it's pretty safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
