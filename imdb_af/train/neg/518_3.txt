Bela Lugosi was not typed in this fantastic twelve-part adventure series, while Frank Chandler / Chandu won the magician's role as a representative of the powers of White Magic against Black's, while displaying fleeting fighting skills. Throw a young Egyptian princess, and cut a thin and thin figure in yacht, completed with a nautical cap. The somewhat plump plot involves Chandler / Chandu in a continuous series of escapes pointing out to save his fiancee, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others of the idol-worshiping sect of Ubasti, which Nadji's blood desires revives an old mummified princess caged on the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old hand at such entertainment, is holding events that are moving fast, but repeated plays and footage found in the previous year's Skull Island area by KING KONG, and the port of SON OF KONG, Reduce the original action to less than 60 minutes from the range's run length of more than two and a half hours and, if seen on the one hand, lack most viewers unless it is uncomfortable.
