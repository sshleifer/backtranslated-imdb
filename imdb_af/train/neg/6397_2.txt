It's a problem with movies coming on television, if there is nothing else to watch. I somehow get into very bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was fairly viewable. The concept of being the only people on earth after a comet, then I find out about zombies, let me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that way it makes you laugh (too stupid) funny. I think I just looked at it. because the star of Trek was the lead. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character anyway.
