They can't really be stupider if this movie dealing with 3 losers trying to catch the college spirit during the annual spring breaks festivals at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these losers do it 15 years after their college year when one is assigned to look at the daughter of a woman who cared for the senator to be the next vice-president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that his daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out of it all. The girls go through drunken anger, exotic dance and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It can't really get much worse than this horrible movie.
