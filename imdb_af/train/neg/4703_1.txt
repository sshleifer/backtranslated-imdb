"Show me your boobies!" is not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons when you understand where I come from. I don't want my 6 and 7 year old girls to think or hear it. I find it sad that Nick is boosting this crap. The same and then what we get, stupid babies acting like stupid adults. I know it's meant to be humorous, but we think out there, with sweet, innocent girls in K and 1 Grade who can't wait to see it. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters won't watch it. I want to love Nick but don't have the heart at this point, but if Nick holds this kind of crap, I have to do it.
