I didn't actually finish the movie. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negative. But I'm just doing it because I stopped because I couldn't watch. I reached more than halfway, and I just got there by promising myself that something was just around the corner. This movie is so tiring, so unclear that I'm actually offended. I didn't read much of the other reviews, so I'm not sure there are other gay teenagers who suffered from it, but I'm gay, and through similar revelations, daydreams, issues, and so on. There may have been two moments where I actually felt that this movie could go somewhere, where I felt it might have some meaning or relativity, but this hope was at the moment that the next set of cliché-famous narratives to the walk. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can't play the scratch, and the echo eye doesn't fall if you just read the quotes, because they're just too painful / ridiculous / stupid to miss. I gave the movie three stars, and all three stars go to the movie movie maker who did a fantastic job of converting Archer's tired "concepts" into something noticeable. I pray that he was not the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV imitation. Another unnecessary cliché already done in movies like Korine's Gummo. I think it is highly appropriate that this film be continued. at Sundance (just because Archer had connections in the festival through voluntary work he did, incidentally ...) because Sundance is the one festival where Cliché is heavily drunk as this is still accepted as "arthouse". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just ordinary house. Don't look.
