The commentary of "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey's program. But it is a haunt to watch William Shatner's "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the points on the word dance are needed for what Bill does). This show will be a good shot on SNL or MAD TV - and it compares a few stars to one view, or to see Shatner, who apparently took a new camping spot - either in a role or himself. But the guy is funny. <br /> <br /> The girls who are in the camping area with the pinbook scrolls will be pretty lucky if this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with an excitement demand for beautiful young women to dance in raised lofts again. <br /> <br /> I watched the first contestant, who was annoying and literally "stupid as a: mail," but with great luck, walked away by a quarter million. The second participant, somewhat intelligent, but congratulated on winning $ 1,000 on Jeopardy, sank through the card that required a special question - which he didn't know, leaving it with zilch. <br /> <br /> This abundance of game shows, which huddles, and sometimes grants, huge amounts to everyday individuals, albeit a cheap effort to address overall efforts. Even if the host is well reimbursed and they give out six digits in an average episode, I suppose the revenue against the cost may be favorable - as you don't have a sitcom role, where several stars are six or seven figures get, by episode, with some big remaining transactions. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the better people will be thin for a long time. This one has already reached this point properly. I think his offer, especially with James Spader, and the other at Boston Legal, should give us a satisfactory amount of Bill Shatner's offer. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is only suitable to see Bill Hoot and Prance, maybe once; It must be sufficient.
