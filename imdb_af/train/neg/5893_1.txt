This movie was fantastic, fantastic than hell. and i mean it washed me off as much as wrist and IT and the omen etc. But with a good movie comes a crap ending right? RIGHT! these movies ended up being pathetic. I mean that a ghost has turned back into a chickens house and now I think I've done that means I can call her and it will be the right time because she thinks it is. right? wrong. my ass! I don't care if the ghost is Satan, it just doesn't happen. it is a movie yes, but most evil movies or prized movies like this are meant to make sense, but it doesn't. it just showed us what I just said and people don't think about it. can someone please tell me why you didn't all notice the pathetic part. the movie for me ended up in hospital and that's all. look number 3 she is much more kicking
