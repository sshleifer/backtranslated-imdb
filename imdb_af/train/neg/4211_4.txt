About 4 years ago, I like this movie. I'll watch it over and over. But now ... I don't. Actually, I think this movie would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a lot of comment-heavy actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a nice cheese plot. My favorite part is when Culkin drives his bike and he comes across a gang and a gangster says, "Hey, Tyler! Where are you going?" The MOON? "Also look at the classic line," Did you feel in your toes? "<br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's better than" The Good Son ".
