There is no spoil in this review, because everything has already been shown in the movie trailer. I try to be balanced in my review because I support strong local movies, but I can't help supporting the backlash against this movie. It is slow, boring and bound to useless. Even the "almost beautiful and credible moments" were immediately suppressed by painful clicks and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were just wise in this movie. It seems as if the director is trying to make a melodramatic TV soap, then carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. The Spring Years must come with a Rated Awful (RA) rating, but it has not changed my belief in local movies. More good movies will come, as long as more films like this are not made.
