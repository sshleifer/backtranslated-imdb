I was hoping this movie would at least be vigilant. The plot was poor to say the least. I expected a lot more to consider the role play (I wonder if any of them would include it on their CVs?). At least I didn't pay to rent it. The best part of the movie is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is complete and complete PANTS.
