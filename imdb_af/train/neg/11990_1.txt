I wish I could give this movie zero. Cheesy effects and acting. The only reason to watch this movie is to see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid Brian plays. What a geek! I couldn't believe the little girl! Then he talked to himself. I think they can't just keep silent the movie, but still. Of course, they also needed skinny dipping, not something I wanted to see. But Jared delivered a good performance compared to the special stock market. Everything from the bear to the accident was something I and myself could do better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen has anything to do with the production, as the movie isn't even called Hatchet. Finally, I don't think the author ever read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stinks like a smelly goat!
