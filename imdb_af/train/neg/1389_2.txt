I was very disappointed in this movie. Plotwise, what was foolish was bad: Souls that can affect reality in the way they do it? A mission apparently entrusted critically to the Soul Hunters to one of their younger members? And the whole B story with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so terrible that I blew to television at one stage: "Why are you wasting my time with it?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "River of Souls" no longer fell into the depths of the soul in depth than the original episode "Soul Hunter". We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still get no sense of their culture. (Are there female Soul Hunters?) <br /> <br /> The play was good, given the material they had to work on, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first action - were very impressive. But overall, I want to say, give this one a miss.
