A lot of women who can't act sit around talking, smoking. They have another woman in a wheelchair that hides them because they are deformed, and sometimes they kill someone to feed this human being's human flesh, which really looks like a store they wore through some plastic fingers to draw. We don't see them kill, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered with a platelet. I can't eat Spam wrap through a sheet as a result. Only the idea of ​​Spam cover by a sheet is enough to cause the same narcoleptic fitness that is tried by all these movies. Sometimes there are random plays from a guy who "hunts" them through a torture of a man he tied to a chair is his basement. Why did he catch this man and how he is linked to the Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of a "superhuman" guy freaking out. He is blood and pushes through a wall, but whoever he is or who is wrong with him is not explained or even tied to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects. , no story. If you want to watch some boring people, you don't talk about anything while you sit and eat and eat smoke, then there are 90 minutes of it, because, except for a scene where one chick on a street corner and random scenes , absolutely nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you will see they move a few things, including the distorted sister, as they move to their new apartment. One of the few times they are not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.
