I passed this title 15 or 20 times while I was in Blockbuster, looking for something halfway to look at. All I can say is that they were all halfway through proper movies the night I chose to rent it. <br /> <br /> I'd give it credit for being better than 'Dracula 3000', but in reality it's pretty easy to say since this one didn't have Caper Van Dien in there. The other things missing in the kicks were: an interesting role, interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can't have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one was a vampire ... figure) flew from mining colony to mining colony to get out all the vampires it could get. wipe. The crew consists of: the hurry, ne'er-do-well captain (who dies early), his by-book, still inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typist), " a wannabe cowboy and a VERY, VERY SHAKE Asian commando, a tough guy ... it almost looks like the cast for MTV's "The Real World". After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a crowd of bloodthirsty (and, as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy), his first mate takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him. Blah, blah, blah ... I can go on, but as I said, it's the same story that is used in about one hundred other 'movies' of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is outside me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a tick) was pretty hot, but of course if you wait for her to expose more than just her fuss, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can't say it was the worst movie I saw, as I actually hired Starship Troopers 2, but waiting for this one to get on the Sci-Fi channel.
