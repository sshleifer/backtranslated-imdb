I saw this movie twice through a pent-cost church that my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was from the nice age of 6, my brother 4, when I was 8 brother again. This movie scared my brother and I and formed how we viewed the world with distrust. It was not just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that so many "Christians" enchant the "mark of the beast" and the rapture. This movie, the church, and a brief negligent education, lead to serious paranoia for the future. For years I have lived under the deceptive effects of the church and fear that I will be forgotten by Christ. I'm now 40 years old. Gone through years of counseling. I once explained this film and the belief system of the church and family to a psychiatrist. I was grabbed with a disorder. I actually started to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me that this cultivating philosophy actually happened. I no longer fear the future, I came with the fear injected by the church into its members. I took this experience to achieve a goal. I am specializing in licensing as a psychologist specializing in children's drama.
