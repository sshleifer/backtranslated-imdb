The movie was terrible. The theater was silent with silence, because everyone was ashamed to be there to see such trash. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him a script with a five-year-old dialogue. The martial arts are 'ok', but if you sit next to the Jackie Chan movies and 'The Matrix', it is better to see one of them.
