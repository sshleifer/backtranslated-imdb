I question its importance for Queer Cinema, as it seems more like a homosexual encounter with violent behavior than making clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are merged in a rather messy way. I tried to eliminate the bad story in the first 15 minutes, and it alone did not put me well. Weak plot points were repeated endlessly as if we didn't get the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a sense of stuffed dialogue throughout the film. More like a 45 minute Boy's Short short rather than a full movie. It had a certain erotic flair, male nudity and sexual appeal, but overall the sum didn't look like its parts. <br /> <br /> The 1st part: Boxer / Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it also felt it was thin.

The third part with the man and woman who beat each other In addition, it was unnecessary and did not add anything to the film, yes, the actors did a good job under the circumstances and the four male leaders were very sexy, the make-up (bruises and cuts) was However, there was not enough meat for this story to have any impact on the gay politician, the film made no statement, wasting time, and was not Attractive or worthy enough for thoughtful investment, his fatal error is his amateur-like approach, which ultimately makes it impossible to take seriously.
