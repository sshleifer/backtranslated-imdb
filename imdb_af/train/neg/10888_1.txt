This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost doesn't exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special-FX just lets you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as a kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie was a comedy, I didn't get the point. If you want to watch this movie, you must first be drunk and then prepare for some good laugh ... especially if the first special FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like scrap movies On the cheapest: this movie is a must see for you.
