Okay, if you have a few hours to waste, or if you just hate your life, I'd say this movie is watching. If it's something, it's good for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so badly are probably banned in most states. Seriously, the rating of 'PG' is also quite humorous as soon as you see the native porn Extravaganza. I won't give this movie to my delayed cousin. You can't even show it to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, and clich√©, and stupid and stupid. The acting is terrible and the end is so painful to see if I actually poured salt into my eye just to take my mind off the idiot that completes my TV screen.
