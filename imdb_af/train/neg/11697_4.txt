I'm not one of those who think King is a good writer, his books are a couple of hours of distractions and often have interesting objects, but I think they get very quickly apart if you think them seriously. br /> <br /> This movie suffers from a pretty precise repetition of King's story. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no change of scenes or characters. It's a movie made by King fans for King fans. For the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the movie, it's a "gypsy curse" horror, with the strife the curse is something many people want to thin. The last third has some serious structural problems, and the slightly forced end seems to break the rules of this genre a bit. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you might as well read the book because there's nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
