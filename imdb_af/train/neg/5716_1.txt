This movie won't be earned for the next few minutes, but I know many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help decide on movies. For this reason alone I write it. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of 1976's "The Incredible Martial Show" (also known as Blood Sucking Freaks). Http://www.imdb com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, abuse, murder, cannibalism ... sure, it's all here with a third-degree script, pathetic acting, and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the movie who have been terrified by the victims of dogs in a market, but are sexually excited about entering a porn stall. One bile that is filthy by a dirt in a stall moments later, is still there with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there is perhaps the only interesting thing about this whole movie.) The movie is absolutely horrible, even for a B movie. Even if you download it for free, it will be an insult to your hard drive.
