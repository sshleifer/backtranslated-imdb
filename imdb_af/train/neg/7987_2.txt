I'm sure it was one of those "WOAH!" attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just stupid. The movie's message is clich√©. The circular vision is disorienting. And the horrible song at the end is timetable. And I really want them to install seats. After so many steps, everything you want to do is sit for a few minutes. And if you hear there's a movie to watch, it sounds pretty glamorous! You're entertained while you're sitting, right? WRONG! You sit there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short railing. Disney needs to make a newer Maelstrom as an attraction to educate things and replace this dull, dim film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact, Canada beats it all in unless you eat there. Move directly to the UK.
