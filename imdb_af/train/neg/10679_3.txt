I didn't expect a movie to be as good as "In The Line of Fire" or a "24" episode, but it seemed like this movie was made for TV and at best made a mediocre job . The (good) role players couldn't hide the fact that the plot was too predictable and actors had to struggle (they were really trying their best to think) through their bad writing lines, giving them rather flat characters any extras. When I watched the movie, I had the feeling that I saw most of this in other (better) movies. In it you have car hunt, big shooting, romance, plot twists and so on. Etc; This movie has nothing. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** Once you see another woman talking to Cuba's character, you know who is behind it and all the tips you've given ("you're too close the president, see it from my perspective. ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it was me (and maybe it's a good thing it's not). I will rewrite the plot as follows: <br /> <br /> First lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired to go through all the time.
