I was scared to take my cousins ​​to this movie because I didn't think it would be well done. The children between the ages of 6 and 10 were keen to see it, so I was doing it. I have to admit that it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought, but was quite far from the book. The film looks right to the 10-year-old's understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6-year-old understands what is going on and offers solutions to the issues that have occurred. I finally had to explain that the movies sometimes do not show the best solutions to the problems, because it's nice to see what happens if they make the "stupid" or "stupid" choices.
