I remembered the title so well. For me it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And this had Vincent Massey's voice from backlit chatter. Well, Flora Robson was wonderful. Her next signature, for me, will be "55 days at Beijing". The same role, but with different beautiful gowns. And the same voice. As far as the Armada is concerned, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was it all done in Elizbethan at night? It was talkative and difficult to understand, sometimes. I couldn't tell what the love interest was. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I don't think Elizabeth would be the brilliant strategist to recommend sending fire ships to the Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for writing. It may have been more accurate, historical, but Bette Davis had more interesting scripts. And I missed the daylight!
