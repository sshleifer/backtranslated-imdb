Another well-known but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) did not film for four years. When invited to participate in a new project, he asked the director's uncle to drop him in a poor Latin environment in Carlson to investigate the work of a small supermarket manager. He sees the beautiful Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and is attracted to her ability. His driver never turns him back and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first she has a job interview for the post of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her be prepared. then they spend the afternoon with a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the useless "10 Items of Less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie doesn't seem to have a storyline, and is backed by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens within 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they will never see each other again. Was he afraid of having a love affair with her and destroying his perfect world with his family? Or was a clash of classes, and did he realize that his fabulous environment would not be sufficient for a simple worker of the lower classes? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Astro em Minha Vida" ("A Star in My Life")
