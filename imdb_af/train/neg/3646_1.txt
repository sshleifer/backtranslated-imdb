Oh ... my ... god ... this is without a doubt the absolute barefoot movie I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole movie just doesn't make sense. Pair it with mediocre direction, really weird scenes (like the one where the child comes across the gorge and falls secretly) and a thorough foolish dialogue ("Look!" "Musta bitten his pants!") And you get a complete failure . Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks, he can defeat, is a case of chocolate bars. But it's part of the movie's charm. Come and sit down with some of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's just BAD!
