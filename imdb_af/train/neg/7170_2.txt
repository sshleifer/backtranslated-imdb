Yikes blow this movie. The characters were weak, the plot was weaker. I thought it couldn't be bad, because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He had to do it because he was bored and needed the money. The characters had to be Irish, but nobody had an Irish accent. I try desperately to find something nice about this. I can't do a good job with a wooden character except Walken. Find something to read, or watch discovery, never see this movie.
