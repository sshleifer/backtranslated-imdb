Three parts "horror" movie with a guy in a tidy house requesting the viewer not to go there and (unfortunately) give us three stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car accident meeting two psychos. This leads to two completely predictable coils. Yet it is fast (about 15 minutes), violent, benevolent and well done. Predictable but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second involves a man who is running after stealing a large amount of money. His car broke down, he was attacked by a dog and stumbled into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and very slow. Even at 30 minutes it is too long. Good acting. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman who is mr. Right looking. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely worthy. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Vote for the one and then switch it off.
