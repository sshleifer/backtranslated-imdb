I saw it on TV the other night? or rather, I often went to another channel to watch infomercials when I could no longer see it. It was bad. Really, very bad. Not so bad, it's good. Just flat out bad. How did it fund? Who thought it was a good idea? An actor friend of mine auditioned and said he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy, but I think what they meant was "save yourself and run away from this steamy pile of @ # $%." I bet the rest of the cast got the option. To be honest, the play was difficult to judge because of the terrible fake American uprisings. The shooting was dulllllllllllll. The action was uncomfortable and quiet. That dialogue was void. The farthest thing is passed. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a loose boat and on the film it doesn't scrub well. Instead of looking very unsuccessful, it looks like a new crew leader with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusty polls. I can't change you, they can change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Stupid, judgment, judgment. Don't see this movie, not even a joke.
