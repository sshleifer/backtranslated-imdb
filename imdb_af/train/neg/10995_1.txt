Anyone who's been watching Comedy Central around midnight over the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. I only saw ads for this movie in 2001. It looked like it could be funny, but I didn't want to call the number on the television screen and order it without first seeing the movie. I thought I'd wait until the blockbuster movie was available. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later I was a copy of this movie at the Tower Records and in the "DVDS for less than $ 20". As the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I came home, put the disc in the DVD player, and waited for the laugh to start ... and I waited even more. The laugh never came. <br /> <br /> I would agree with almost every other comment on this page if I say this movie was terrible. Sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMEDIE FILM is a horrible piece of garbage and is, in my opinion, the worst movie of all time. No stars.
