This horror movie is very poor ... that's when it's the right movie I comment on. Nothing really terrible continues when a family accepts a cute little Shepard puppy. I had a German Shepard and it is a very good dog. I didn't have the idea of ​​getting one of this movie, but rather of the comedy "K-9". However, this is another story. This movie doesn't really have much horror because the most horrible scene is over and it looks really cheesy. We also see that a man almost puts his hand in a lawnmower. It's about it. However, the father suspects something, because his family looks rather strange, somewhere he finds out if you keep a mirror on them while they sleep, and you can see if they are in possession. All in all, a very poor horror movie, even by television standards. Television movies that do work are there as 'This House Possessed' is pretty good and there is another haunted movie about a woman and these weird creatures who also prefer. good. This one is really boring.
