I would say it was the worst gay-themed movie I have ever seen, but I can honestly say it is the worst movie of any genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know you 'Be in trouble when a movie starts with a "personal note" from the director, asking for the audience's understanding of the "many challenges" a director of face the first time. The soundtrack is so bad in many scenes, it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and that of a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor writing, generally bad acting action to make this "movie" unwavering. I made it to the bad end after several attempts, and immediately gave away the DVD I foolishly bought. I'm sure there are many challenges facing a first time director. But don't try to get rid of this lame effort as a final product. I see from IMDb details that it wasn't just Richard Natale's first attempt, but also the only one. This is the one positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
