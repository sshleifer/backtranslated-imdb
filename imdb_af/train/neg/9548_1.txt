I can't believe I've seen it expect more. It starts well. This movie pushes the boundaries of reality too far! At least the first was somehow realistic. It ripens off the first movie and even calls the Joshua project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. It does have a good message in it though, look out for big brother !!! The movie just makes it look like Big Brother is much bigger than it really is. It was very aggravating. Even the makeup on the actors was quite bad. Some of the plays are pretty good. However, some of the plays are really bad. The script was OK on some points and was completely wasted elsewhere. This movie plays comfortably every five minutes. As I said, I can't believe I was looking to expect it. I think I'm going in the original doll to return to Earth ... Q
