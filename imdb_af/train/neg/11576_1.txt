Seen this at UCSB's real loud festival and was * shocked that it won the golden rule award. I wasn't the only one, as the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better movies out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted in the field of film theory and other artificial crap. While cinematography and editing are on the same scale as many other shorts, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. Seems like 'serious' student videos should include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal, and ultimate suicide. Nick and Kate police out and lock in all three. Please, be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and this may be my outsider's opinion, but Montecito's guy sounds a bit fake. Is there anyone else like that?
