Well, somebody, sometime, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies moving away from the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give the artists props to do their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launch were hardware up and running. The graphics were generally pretty good. The rocket launch gave me cold fever, as a good rocket launch always did (my popular mechanical pilot-gear blood is still strong) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG was not Pixar quality, but it was generally good. The flies were a kind of mediocre anthropomorphism, with a few half-late-60-year-old characters plucking in for color (hippie flies, African-American flies with giant red and black shades, etc.) And the virgins looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made appropriate gross sounds). <br /> <br /> The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, depending on offensive and outdated clich√©s (60s gender politics, including mostly useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, a fat fly that just wants to eat, grade are ~-level coarse humor). In a movie aimed at IMAX, they have a great opportunity to sneak into some educational content on physics and space - they haven't done their physics (zero-g in the moon module during landing of burns?) . They couldn't "Don't even bother to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all of which are in the public domain; Instead, they wrote their own dialogue, which looked like crap. <br /> <br /> But we love the stomach. <br /> <br /> So they get a point and a half for rockets and virgins. Uh, yay. 1.5 / 5.
