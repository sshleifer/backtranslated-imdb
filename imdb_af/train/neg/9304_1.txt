I saw many silly movies in my life, many, but it is without a doubt the worst ever! I usually like silent movies, if they're somewhat entertaining, but I can't even think of one good thing about this movie. I love "Teen Witch" for Heaven's sake. But S.I.C.K. acted horribly, pornography over the whole thing, and even the sex scene sucked! I will have to compare the lameness of this movie with the "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys" or even a lot of Brady Sequel. Although, it is much worse than any of those. I beg you, don't even waste your time. Believe me, its 2 hours you will never come back.
