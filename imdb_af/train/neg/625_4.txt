With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the gore could have been pg-13 and there was a lot of sweat when the mum had the original jackass-hearted boy. There was a lot of character development that made the movie look better, and when the child returned as the scarecrow, there was a senseless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. The violence was excessive and I think the body number was higher than twelve, which is a large number for movies like this. Almost every character in the film is stabbed or chopped off, but the teacher who called him "white rubbish" and "hoodlum" (although the character runner is nothing else, I'm not even close, I know hood and is part chop, they do not sign in class, they sit there and throw things at the teacher). The teacher deserves a more horrible death than any of the characters, but has just been stabbed in the back. There were two exciting scenes in the film, but didn't take long enough to be scary. As I said, the murders were excessive and sometimes people who had nothing to do with the story cut off their heads. If the gore was actually fun to see, it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body that they find in the wheat fields, they describe it as a much prettier than it actually was, they explained to the police that there were virgins crawling around in the throats of the guys. His stomach was not even cut open, so there was no way to be stomach in his stomach, although I would like to see it. The acting was pathetic, characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do many gymnastic stunts. I suggest that this movie be hired for the screenshots, I won't see it again soon, but I enjoyed the excessive violence. Don't save the sequel too, I watched it for five minutes and was bored to death, it sounds good, but it's not. The original scarecrow was really interested in me.
