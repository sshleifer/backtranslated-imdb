A few beautiful scenery, but the story itself - in which an Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and does Egypt in the most ego-egoistic ways (eg. Flash photography in the graves, handling old parchment, etc.) .), a black market chart war is uncovered, and somehow (in the two-day, no less!) becomes the war-expression drill center - is more enigmatic than any mystery the Sphinx ever made. Down is just as horrible as the British visitor (it seems she knows absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt, and even less about antiquities is the fault of the authors, but being annoying when everyone comes out, her own fault is completely ), and the rest of the film, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, look just as straight through the proceedings as I was. In short, not what you expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and fellow. <br /> <br /> Worth looking at a legally dated scene where Down sees all male scholars, they are guilty of her Failure as an academic, while under the gentle light, Hollywood could hone. To download it, she spent the next hour filming and screaming and running into the arms of any man she could get. Wow, talk about your prospective irony! <br /> <br /> * Note Egyptians: Take a year or two of the Arabic in the graduate school. It will really help in the long run ...
