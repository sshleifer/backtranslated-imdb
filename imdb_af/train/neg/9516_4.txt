Frank Sinatra plays a non-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, drunk and hard-drinking, returning to his Midwestern hometown and reuniting with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the town's big boots with an interested wife and headstrong daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flute Shirley MacLaine, and has some institutions with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle with a good woman. Over-simplified drama took place on soap opera, with a role for MacLaine which, in turn, is too colorful and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken banding on "After You've Gone", however, is the highlight of the movie and is skilfully handled) . Director Vincente Minnelli keeps it straight ahead, but he is in surprising glum spirits and most of the big screens are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly attractive in wide screen, with a good eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** of ****
