I just read a review that defended this movie because it had a low budget, and now I take it. <br /> <br /> The CGI samples were pretty well animated, but implemented in the worst possible way. The battle scenes didn't even have fights, it was just one shot of an actor, then one shot of the monster with lots of interaction was not at all. When the sample interacted, it looked like it was done in Paint Shop Pro. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use models and dolls. They may not look so fancy, but they vary anyway, just look at Peter Jackson's early films. <br /> <br /> What the play Beowulf did has a descent work, but the rest of the cast didn't try or they forgot. where they were true. <br /> <br /> The writing was confused for me. One minute they would talk as if it was a modern day next time, you get the drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not saying it's all about it, but it's needed, but you need to find a coherent balance so the lines sound like they're coming from the same person. <br /> <br /> I saw one part near the start when Beowulf quoted the Old Testament as would have been found if he didn't speak the rest of the movies about the gods and portents. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a very slightly polished Thick, but a twist.
