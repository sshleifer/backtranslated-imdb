This was the first successor I saw (apart from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before I looked at it to be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline was basically the first writing with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who is not satisfied with life on land. She wants to be a mermaid. However, Ariel kept her daughter's past because she wanted to protect her - and when Melody finds out she's upset and angry. And then she decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy to swim around, and Ariel goes out to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't sound too bad, but the clips and repetitions of situations of the first movie are just too obvious. And add the fact that Melody is generally very annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of other new characters - Tip and Dash are two of them. They are not bad as characters in themselves - try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs also leave a lot to be desired, they not only have the same magic energy as the songs of the original. Of course, the animation doesn't have a whole lot of work in it. In parts it is leaping, and not much imagination is used for the characters' movements. <br /> <br /> Another piece of advice - try to forget Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has "all grown up" in a dull, boring woman and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. It is much better requested if you have never seen the original. You have nothing to compare it to. <br /> <br /> All in all, it could have been worse - it's not as bad as certain Other sequels, like Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But continuing this for your collection as nothing but Disney will lose all their older fans.
