This is by far the WORST movie I've ever seen. I was expecting a cheese film, but at least with a few cool car screens / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is such a low budget that put them at risk of making the cars go "fast". At one stage, a Mercedes SLR goes from about 200 to 0 like 4 seconds by just turning around in circles. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, see the fast and the furious series. They can be a little cheese, but 100x better than this movie can ever hope for. Better still, just watch Mischief 3000, the best motorcycle movie I've ever made.
