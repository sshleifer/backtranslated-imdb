As a film maker, White Noise was a huge disappointment. As a movie maker, cinematography was pretty good, well lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. But as a movie, it has only become predictable than all the other so-called horror movies that have flooded the market recently. Although it did have a bit of the chill factor, the whole concept of the E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not come true. This movie did not explain the reasoning for certain events but continued with them. The acting was far from the spirit that blew the main character, no emotion, like many recent thriller / horror movies. <br /> <br /> Definitely not a movie I will buy on DVD and will not recommend anyone to watch it.
