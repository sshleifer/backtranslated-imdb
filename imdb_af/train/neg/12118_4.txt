In 1972, after his wife left her own path, Elvis Presley met Linda Thompson. Miss. Thompson, a well-known, long-haired, beautiful statue of beauty queen, is mapped to fill a gap in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda was the legendary artist's live friend and travel companion until 1976. <br /> <br /> It is a good look at their love affair and companion. Linda keeps her sad at her lover's needs and desires. And even with his handles sitting with his swallowing medicine and introducing her for her own love affair with valium. Sometimes this film is hard and dark of heart; A very unattractive look at the 'King' and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely horrible as Elvis. It's not attractive to play. Stephanie Zimbalist has the elegance of Linda, but the work is pretty good. Supporting film includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz. Looking at it twice is more than enough for me, but don't let this review prevent you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans I told you, it's not a proposed event.
