I know nothing about the author's or the director's previous work, so I didn't bring any prejudices to the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in the TV guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But impeccability was stacked on unavailability. Every turn of the plot was an excuse to drag more bloodshed, horrific makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer looked like a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. This was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I won't go through the vagaries of the story, but I'll give an example of what I think is an excess of explicit gore. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to a secluded mansion and pulls the frozen body of his former victim (Wendt) from the freezer. McKenna killed Wendt by biting a piece of his neck. Now he feels he has to destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's demise. (What will the police do, she measures bite radius?) McKenna withdraws Wendt's head and neck from the freezer that enters it, takes an ax and starts to cut off Wendt's head. Swipe. Swipe. Swipe. The bit of ax keeps away from Wendt's neck. The air is filled with nuggets of frozen meat, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He brushes it off when he finishes.) McKenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he built. He puts the head on the ground, crabs next door, takes some pictures of a woman he just killed, and shows them to Wendt's head. "Remember her? We could really have made it if it wasn't for you, 'he told the head. "Duke, you've always kept bonfires, haven't you?" he asks. Then he puts his head on the fire. We only get a glimpse of this fire, but we can hear the fat in the flame. <br /> <br /> I don't want this kind of garbage to be censored. I just wonder who enjoys seeing these things. <br /> <br /> There is no need to continue with the rest of the movie. Well, I will mention one example of an "incompetence", since I brought up the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark bare loft. He knows he'll be half dead the next few days. (He literally invited the sword to do that.) What would you do in this Poe situation? Here's what McKenna is doing that may seem to be the last night of his life. He finds a discarded calendar with a pin-woman on it and masturbate (successful). Give the man the medal of freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster resembling Pizza the Hut is thrown into unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often handmade and shaky. The dialogue has lines like: "Life is a piece of ***. Or else it's the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view." Use is made of a wide angle lens that changes ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house is being blown up in an explosive fireball while hero McKenna walks to the front of us. <br /> <br /> He is also some hero. He first killed a man for $ 13,000 by pinching his head several times with a heavy statue, then a pot plant, before finally throwing a fridge over the body. (It bothered him a bit, but not enough to prevent him from paying.) Then I hope I straightened the order, killing Wendt by ripping out a portion of his neck. Then he accidentally kills the wife of his first victim and estimates the sword for it, but almost any moral calculations have nothing to do with it. Next, he burns the head honcho (Baldwin) alive. Then, after turning off the two lesser hassles, he deliberately inflated them, although one of them was not completely impersonal. And we need to root for McKenna. <br /> <br /> It's not cartoon deaths like those in the Dirty Harry movies - scared and you're dead. It's slow and painful. The first one - the $ 13,000 murder - is made uncomfortable to look like what can happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another person, as Hitchcock demonstrated in Torn Curtain. But that scene doesn't lead to a place. <br /> <br /> Some people can enjoy it, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that just happen in movies. Some meretric stuff on the screen here.
