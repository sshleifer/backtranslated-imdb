Remember to keep the dirty details of this treacherous "film", dug in the chest cavity with a rusty, salted spoon in the chest cavity. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) is a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a movie is just one of the most scandalous commercials I've ever heard. A boy fighting spies / terrorists when he is alone in a Chicago suburb with chickenpox? Ridiculous! Why did this movie have to be made? I'm the kind of person who believes that even horrible movies don't waste time, but rather learn experiences. But it's actually a waste of time. This should be avoided at all costs.
