Due to budget discounts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a spiritual institution (although she killed six people) and was delivered to Halfway House Hope Bartholomew. Once there, she immediately returns to her criminal ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! Suck this movie! You know you're in trouble when the open credits start and they're just the credits of the first movie, apparently filmed by a TV screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to Crazy Fat Ethel's world in ten years' time and with a budget that probably covered the cost of an empty band and video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style doesn't translate well into video. Seriously, I made home movies with more production value than that. And Millard is trying to draw a SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 by supplementing half of the running time with recordings of the first movie (which seems to have been taken from a worn VHS copy). Alden is good again as Ethel, but the film is so indifferent that you feel sorry for her playing in this garbage. I mean, at least the first movie tried. Here we have no music, worse effects (if not at all possible), shaky camera work, horrible sound and editing that seem to have been done with two video recorders. Avoid it at all costs!
