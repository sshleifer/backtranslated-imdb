While some scenes of training were realistic, too many of them depicted military instructors as ex-Nazi types. Obviously the people who wrote the screenplay were either anti-military types or wrote a movie for that audience. <br /> <br /> I'm a Vietnam veterinarian and even during this period, military instructors who were doing some of this would probably still be in military prison. <br /> <br /> And I really love the scene where the "hero" and his buddy (both privates) sit in the captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their partner. This kind of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, just like the purpose for the scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, I asked myself, "What did this movie work about?" As it turns out to wander around the place, without focus, except "I hate all authority." Thanks, I got it from the library and didn't pay to rent it.
