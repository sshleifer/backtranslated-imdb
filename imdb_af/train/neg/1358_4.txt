The words "Swedish" and "Action movie" do not mix. This is becoming increasingly apparent with every effort in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works on a military airbase with top secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has its ups and downs. And usually in Swedish action movies there are no "ups", just "downs". So I think something in this movie has some quality. To begin with the positive remarks I can mention that the movie was technically well made. The images of airplanes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice. The acting is of varying quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is usually stiff and unnatural (I wonder how long Swedish directors are going to use her, although she has the acting of a wooden board?). Stefan Sauk is laughable as the "cool" special man who comes to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> What about the action scenes? Well as I said above, the screens of planes and helicopters are nice. But besides, there is not much action to talk about. And this is a common problem with Swedish action films. There is just not enough action going on. Perhaps this is a budget problem, perhaps it is film culture. I don't know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because, frankly, the story and acting are not good enough for this movie to rely on. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for effort.
