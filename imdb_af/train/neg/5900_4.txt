Young and attractive Japanese people are back on the wrong side of a curse, this time it involves mobile phones. Several people die to the disgruntled spirit after all this has been unearthed, so if you have seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror movies, you can tie this movie with your hands in the dark. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far, I was more impressed with its low key works such as the City of Lost Souls, but as a missed call plundered, I longed for his more famous envelope printing Death or Alive or the excessive pseudo Cronenberg style of Audition. In spite of the fact that many of his films are essentially empty, they have at least merit such as this, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano, which appears in shiny costumes that Johnny Depp portrays. There is nothing in it in one missed call; There is very little of the credit: the acting is vague and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of terror or tension, and in places it is just boring. <br /> <br /> But, there are moments where Miike's glacier sense of humor moves through mere commercialism; especially with the appearance of the TV program's intention to film the downfall of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer is more concerned about his ratings than the girls' lives. But besides, there is nothing to suggest that it is Miike behind the camera; especially his usual visual flair disappeared without any trace (and that includes his familiar gore), although it is more likely he just didn't have enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One missed call is not offensive. This is just frustrating on average. <br /> <br /> Of course Miike is in charge. With its huge annual output, it goes without saying that it will not be 100% concerned about all its projects. But even with that in mind, One Missed Call felt he was just paying the bills.
