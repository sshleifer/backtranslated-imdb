I almost made myself a fool when I started this review by saying: "This movie reminds me of BILLY ELLIOT, but then I looked up the resume of Lee Lee to find out he was the man. what BILLY ELLIOT wrote, so it is Mr Hall who doesn't make a fool of himself <br /> <br /> Am I a little cruel? No, because Lee has something most other aspiring Britain's authors did not, he had his foot in the door, he had previously written a successful British film that won awards and made money at the box office, and what did he do next? /> <br /> Young Jimmy Spud lives on a kitchen bench, he is bullied at school and no one loves him The only thing he likes is that he is aspiring to be a ballet dancer. He has aspirations to be an angel, but if he is considering his household, he can also be a ballet dancer. dad who thinks "Ballet dancers are a lot of punches while his grandfather says" Ballet dancers are as difficult as any man you can meet. I remember seeing the Bolshoi ballet ... "Yup Ballet is a leading point at a British management office that day - NOT. Come to think if it is not the left-wing politics that seems to be the only middle-class custody. don't be governors living in pretty big homes, so immediately feel everything about this setup is ridiculously false. <br /> <br /> Another big criticism is that it's a movie that has no idea who's trying to dress I have often criticized Channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times (THE COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE BEEN WATCHED AT 6 AM), but they showed it at 02:00 and for one time they noticed it. the story involves politics, ballet dance (Gawd I hate it) lung cancer and poverty there is no way to regard it as suitable for a family member, but since the main character is an 11 year old child and knows angels and ballet dancers (don't blame me if I'm obsessed with the subject - it was not necessary to not referring to them they have not heard much for an intelligent adult. <br /> <br /> Of course, if Lee Hall is told by the producers at the script development phase that he has to write a story with a schoolboy and an angel and flat refused to say he wants to write about other themes and stories then I apologize, but in the movie you get the feeling that once the movie is completed, it will be sold to exactly the same audience that BILLY ELLIOT enjoyed.
