While I surely consider the Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I don't like it in many respects like many other horror fans. As a result, I didn't see much of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is something to do, I have to say it's a good thing, as this movie is boring and definitely not worth it. not spend. ninety minutes later! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-offs, it is often regarded as one of the worst, and so it might not be the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl owned by a demonic spirit (which is the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then handed in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror movies, this one star Paul Naschy, which is pretty much the best aspect of the movie. Exorcismo is directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derived Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I did not see any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strengths. There aren't many good things I can say about the movie itself; it usually just flows and the exorcist scene is not worth waiting for. I definitely don't recommend it!
