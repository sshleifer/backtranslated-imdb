This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "Just like people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from the environment and I've experienced the movie as "Like people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there for minimum wages. We laughed a lot, bound us and broke with people our own age; The young people went out together at night. The older people had little free time after work because they cared for their families. The area is beautiful in summer and not gloomy in winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Apart from the "if you live in a manufactured home, you need to be depressed" charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the worst hit. It is doubtful that someone who was so oppressed belonged to a church, but if she had, she would probably have made friends there. I read reviews that believe that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and thinner", but if not, it was not shown. All we actually see is that Martha learns to deceive Rose for reasons that would apply as much as the three friends were the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, out of the loop, when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and eventually do not respect and hurt. <br /> <br /> One more thing: Should we suspect Kyle of murder because he once had panic attacks? Please. It takes stigma against mental illness on a new level.
