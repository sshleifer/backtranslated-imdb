I hated this shit every day as part of tgif and it was a great time with stupidity every week. If you want to see something funny, see 'No On Would Tell'. Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, who are really hilarious, show exactly why no one ever had a good film career, after having done a terrible TV show. This show makes me sick, I hate those kids, and bob must start from a bridge to make forever. I saw things everywhere differently here. I write 10 lines! See 'full house' to see how the least humanity is in the way of art and entertainment.
