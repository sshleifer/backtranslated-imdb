A sentimental school drama in Denmark, 1969, "We must overcome" offers a pathetic Danish on American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a flower-power obsession, naive 13-year-old, left half of his ear hanging from the brutal master Lindum-Svendsen's (Bent Mejding) office. Lindum-Svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, controls the local community. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there was not enough drama yet.), And to stereotype hippie music teacher Mr Svale ('Hi, call me Freddie') ), Frits stands up for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell you what. It is so convincing, over (method), and so full of misery that if a "family" fails this grotesque filled with clich√©'s excuse for a movie to convince non-Scandinavian audiences. Sorry, friendly Danish readers, to crash into your sentimental journeys. But it is definitely NOT a story about a 'boy who is becoming a man by the system'. The boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eyebrow. If you call a church of small-town little people, led by a dictator like a character-like character "the system", I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you are in family photos, see Happy Feet instead.
