I can't believe I've spent just an hour and a half watching such a poor movie. If there is only one movie you should miss, this is the one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father has recently died, so he starts with some local anti-social teens and drugs. All these things subconsciously make him more violent and ultimately explode this subconscious ... <br /> <br /> The first thing I don't think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this movie, not in any single character If the director is of the opinion that I have seen great ecstasy in the last few minutes, I must say that it is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time I couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and I didn't feel the body language enough to make an impact. Perhaps the crew is just as tired that they can find the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everyone happy except the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly poor. There are many unrelated scenes and talks that are supposed to be related, but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, maybe not if you are one they wrote. <br /> <br /> In the one and a half hours you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all the other time there are only people who walk, talk and move. So I really can't comment here. <br /> <br /> Good choice of music in the last few minutes. Maybe it's the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I've never given a movie a 1, but this movie definitely deserves it (at least you're laughing at watching Scary Movies). It is a film about when a failed attempt to portray challenged teenagers meets an extremely disturbed audience. Hope you fall into no group.
