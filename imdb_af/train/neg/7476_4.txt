Angry Aliens blamed Peter Jackson's early films Bad Taste and Braindead for a huge blame. I have to confess that I don't particularly enjoy those movies, and I also say about them. Jake West is a director who clearly has his own inspiration and chooses to steal those he looks for. I lose count of times, a big Hollywood movie is especially called James Cameron's Aliens. The amount of blood and gore on the show here is also not funny, the last side of the movie gets tired Maybe it would have worked better than a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is poor and the plot does not exist. I can see what the director is trying to do, the tribute he tried to pay, but others did the same thing much better than offered here. 10/04
