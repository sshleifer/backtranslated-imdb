Where is it written that persecutors must suck? Scream 2 didn't! Others don't! But this one did happen ... problems include scary actors (only Christopher Walken can act in the whole movie), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on, and I even researched the idea of ​​Nephilim before) and just terrible choices for casting. Eric Roberts makes the stupid archangel Michael I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the pest unless you are desperate to see Christopher Walken. Then just jump to the parts where he is in the movie and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
