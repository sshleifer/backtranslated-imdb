I couldn't wait to see this movie. About half through the movie, I couldn't wait for it to end. All the (white) actors were delivering their lines as Woody Allen just said, "So say ..." Then they said their lines on the screen said they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really speaks, and he doesn't stumble over his words like Mr. Not all. The comedy part of this movie was just as boring as the tragedy and certainly never funny or even entertaining. I have to admit I have never been a great Woody Allen fan, and this movie certainly has not changed me. I think his writing was just as bad as his direction. This movie is one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen.
