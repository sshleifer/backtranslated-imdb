Oh my god. The idea that this movie is a thrill is an absolute joke to me. Besides the point it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all out of shame. <br /> <br /> I'm usually not critical of any movie, because each person has his / her style. But this movie was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe this movie is unknown and I think it should stay that way, because movies like this make the genre genre joke. /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of thriller movies or even movies to stay away from this one.
