First, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the side of the cult leader. The actor who portrays Igor believed it was shouting loudly, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile as you protrude your eyes, a great way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of shouting (because he never actually spoke) in a loud voice. He will also say idiotic one-liners. For example, when the cult leader kills one of his followers with a bend, I scream it, Paul! No Paul! Why did you do this? I could have cut her clean! So clean! "In another scene, Igor tells a victim that she needs to get her own tools for surgery, because it was his time to work." Apart from the bad acting, the end didn't make sense, because while the build up a story that has steamed it against the climax, which is Igor to get a crossbow arrow to the head and kill the rest of his insane friends, he points out twice to kill the remaining 'good guys'. film does not explain this, but tells the viewer that Igor has escaped from the mental hospital.What bottom line is not wasting your time watching this movie.I wish I could get back the moments I lost.
