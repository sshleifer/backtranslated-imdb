I like Boyle's performance, but it's about the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors talked as if you would expect your 9-year-old cousin to speak as if pretending to be a dressed, stubborn policeman or an ultra-evil villain. The grumpy voice leftover was amateur to me. I can buy a cheap synthesizer and exchange better opening music. And how about the whole 1984 police crew? It was completely redundant and has nothing to do with the real events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, which he believed would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. It's a big disappointment, because one of the things Borges' stories make so good is his minimalism - they are strictly bound, without unnecessary detail. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped looking at the scene where Lonnrot questioned the man of the Yidish Zaitung, or from there. I wasted $ 4, but I can at least get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully save others from the same mistake.
