Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eighty numbers heard in the cinema. Look at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Somewhere between them I look at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All the stories had no relation to each other, but somewhere in the queue, Nikhil Advani, tried to show some connection between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write. The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood lover LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
