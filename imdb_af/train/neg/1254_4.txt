I saw and kept the original movie and expect more of a remake than that. <br /> <br /> GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and the footage, they are adequate, and the performances were good. Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were good and a handful of supporting supporting actors worked with limited roles. The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BATH: The escape from the monkey city was terrible. The characters go in circles, then there are tunnels everywhere in the city center to escape. Plus, what escape route leads through everyone's bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story was neglected to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie has more meat for it and deserves more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the end was completely stupid as offered. Without seeing the inevitable successor, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
