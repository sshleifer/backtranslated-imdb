I don't know why the fans have it and I don't know why I even gave it the score I got. This is ominous. There is a lot you need to do to suspend disbelief, let the picture come in before it becomes noisy and some poor police officers must finally explain what we have seen. But it went very little and has surviving rows where nothing happens and nothing is important while listening to a repetitive soundtrack, even according to Italian standards. Not a giallo, it's a complete mish mash of horror ideas with Klaus Kinski in one of his most blatant 'phoned in' appearances. I think he came up, did a day's work and kept away from Mr. Leave D'Amato to fill others. Ewa is of course beautiful, but no it is not enough, and finally we have seen too much of her bang all over the place, long after we have completely lost interest in this ceaseless and pretentious twaddle. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood!
