The prospect of an African-American female Scrooge in the modern, struggling city is inspired, but nothing else in this movie is. Here is Mrs. Scrooge is a miserable banker who benefits from the employees and clients in the largely poor and black environment in which they live. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the story's roots do not translate well into the urban environment of this movie, and the script fails to make the work work. Also, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience gets tired of it before the film reaches its familiar end. This is a message movie that doesn't know when to stop. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson gives rise to excessive action, and sometimes lines are difficult to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been modified so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
