To look, it lives at night, makes you wonder, just who in the world is this khaki green. A newly-married couple will play on their honeymoon, be attacked by bats and start walking around in his pajamas attacking different people. And where are they exactly? They are in the desert, then they are skiing, then they are in a small village that seems to be near mountains. The village is run by a sheriff who likes to look and has a personal vendetta against a shiny doctor's boy. The ski hospital is run by a very coarse man with a nice thick mustache and the woman looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the end will fill you with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston had the effect for this movie. I think you have to start somewhere.
