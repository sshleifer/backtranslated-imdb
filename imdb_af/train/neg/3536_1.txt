I don't think I've ever made it feel like a movie. After I loved Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I don't count Swept Away - he was blind vagina), I was looking forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> The reviews were poor, and then again I didn't trust the press. More worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was a bit stinker, so I handed over Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to try to explain this movie, mainly because I didn't have an idea about it and at one point I was honestly close to getting up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie apparently fell into his wife's trap to take himself too seriously. It doesn't seem to be good enough for him to make good-plot movies, laugh, funny dialogue and good characters. It is almost as if he had a checklist of movies he wanted to exit, here are some of the things I noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were really good and it was really the confident story and editing / direction that made the movie . <br /> <br /> Such a big, big thumb from me.
