Dull, inexpensive sci-fi thriller, made with an almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices that receive and decrypt messages from outer space is only managed by ONE MAN and is poorly monitored in the mornings) , and full of campus sound effects. Christopher Lee is not just wasted, but he also gives one of his little "I am here strictly for the money" appearances. (* 1/2)
