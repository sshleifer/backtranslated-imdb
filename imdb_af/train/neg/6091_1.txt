I bought this movie thrillingly a glorious free, over-entertaining massacre. I have none of them. This movie fails at almost every level, not least frightening or funny, it's just a horrible movie, and never offers the audience something worth seeing. What is so bad is that it is not so weird, violent and brutal as it promised, there is very little violence. Almost no blood shed, and no excitement whatsoever. Action, direction and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really laughable. I could barely go through this total rubbish once; I will never see it again. Don't waste your time wasting celluloid like this; This is probably the worst movie ever made. If I could give it less stars, I would.
