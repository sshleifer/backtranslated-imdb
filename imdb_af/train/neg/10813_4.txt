The first half of this version was the best I saw (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever). The development of Jane's childhood and character was exceptional. Then it was as if someone had said, "Uh, it runs too long," and hacked the rest of the story. The big scenes, when not included at all, are shining, combined and delayed in such a way that they completely change the storyline. There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone who didn't know the story, even to follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end hit it.
