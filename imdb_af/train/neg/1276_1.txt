It's the only worst movie I've ever seen. Let me say this again: THIS IS THE SINGLE, SUCCESS MOVIE I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It had all the hallmarks of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music. I thought there were a few points for horror movies. The first is that it's supposed to be enough to scare you. This movie gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a person dies or something bad happens to them, we are supposed to care. This movie also gets a F in this regard. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is killed by wolves after she's afraid it will happen to her. The next story, an OCD guy does not die carefully and speaks to a dead friend of his. Oh, and then there is the terrible, nail-biting story of a bad roommate. Come on, can you choose topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a home, being anal-persistent, and having a roommate? Show all these stories where hallucinations, virtual reality are caused by a doctor who uses it himself again. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. I couldn't do this with this one. It was pain to sit and watch. Under no circumstances should this movie be seen. You will regret it.
