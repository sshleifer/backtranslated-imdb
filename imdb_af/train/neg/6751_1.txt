My boyfriend and I hired it because we thought it might be a good "Halloween" farewell. A killer who terrorizes young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We were dead wrong! No pun is meant. Not only did we discover one of the worst movies out there, but also a cult classic! It's filled with plot holes and doesn't make sense. The actress playing Maddy is pretty, but it's about it. I give credit for this shot at a very low budget - I always support such movies. Just not this one. <br /> <br /> This movie might be good to see if you're drunk or tall; bothered otherwise. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did!
