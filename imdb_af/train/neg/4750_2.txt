I would give it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and short, hence the morals were not clearly expressed. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada had a difficult time handling his role. I could see that there are western elements in the show, but there are some parts where Chinese elements were needed too! For example, the villain. His physical appearance is similar to a robot, rather than something outside of Chinese culture. The final and worst mistake was the wrong and distorted facts placed in the show. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that it is a "Kid's show" and therefore it does not require such high standards. However, there are other Disney programs, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in terms of story development and presentation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies are better researched and better planned. A good performance is not enough, with just a series of martial arts moves to be able to.
