It was maliciously bad movie. It will eat your heart out while you see it. I beg you: don't see this movie! You will hate losing 1.5 hours of your lifetime! It's not like some movies that are so bad you can see and enjoy them. This movie is boring as ... there's nothing as boring as this movie. You will hate yourself after watching this movie to the end. And you will hate yourself that you didn't listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and I watched this movie to the end. Excuse me now, I'll shoot myself. I saw everything. <br /> <br /> Please. Read it very carefully. Don't see this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
