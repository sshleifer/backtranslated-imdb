Just think, it costs a total of $ 250,000 to make Clerks. How hell did they spend $ 45 million to make this glorious music video? An almost unknown saucepan, two or three sets, no special effects I could see. I know it should have been on that expertly crafted, economical, stress-filled script. Shoot, that bar set should cost a bundle. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not get caught dead for anything. I'm just surprised he didn't blow anything up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it wasn't a terrible movie I think. The female lead seemed to have had good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It seems a pity that this rather mediocre $ 5m project could be made without any loss of production, and six more $ 5m worth of earnings could also be made.
