Charlotte's deadly beauty and deadly kicks make the movie cooler than it would be otherwise. The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if it's the end they thought. I wish someone could say there is an alternative end but I don't fear it. As for the rest of the cst, I would say they simply didn't do well; Although the debt should be placed on the poor manuscript. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi dies in an absurd way as she was the only one who stole the show throughout the movie. I can give this movie 2/5
