The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest, I didn't watch the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth considering? The answer was clearly no! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant of another species without rejecting it. Nor is the assumption that he has been chased by secret government authorities for a human / wolf transplant. This was because the movie was poorly written, having acting emotions and I didn't understand the different dream sequences with the wolves and buffalo. When he ran to the zoo with a dog pack and left the front of the zoo's gate, the words "If you can't run with the big dogs, don't leave." Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you dare to see it, and you will sit there because I wondered why someone wasted money, time, energy and effort to make this offensive outrage for the American cinema.
