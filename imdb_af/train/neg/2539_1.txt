Must be one of the worst 35mm movie movies ever unleashed on the public, the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo-documentary original movie "The Legend of Boggy Creek". Bad dissertation, worse acting, etc., Ens., Dawn Wells had to hope Gilligan would save her and bring her back to the island just to escape from this slap trap.
