I go to UCSB and take classes with executive producer Alison Anders. She is a wonderful teacher and director, anything she gave her name. I thought it should be pretty good. This movie as a choice at the Santa Barbara Film Festival is a good choice. <br /> <br /> While this movie included good pictures and cinematography, the lack of story and coherence really took away everything it tried to achieve. My biggest problem was that it was someone's first movie and of course you can tell. Bad acting and an even worse screen shot stopped this movie from getting off the ground. The soundtrack had a nice music that gave a sense of the main characters to struggle to handle the sadness that led to his departure and now return the place he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the movie, it's a lack of story and performance really prevents it from being a little good.
