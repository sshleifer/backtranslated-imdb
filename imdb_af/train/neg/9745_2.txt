This movie is played in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when they tore this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad makeup, bad effects, chick in skimpy (1960s) underwear. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of the makeup. The assistant says things like "not you" that sound like NACHOO !! (don't think so). It's just a bad ear. The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still don't know what the "Projected Man" means in terms of the plot. However, I have missed out from the beginning. <br /> <br /> What about this 10 line minimum on the farm?
