OK. Don't make a bad movie if it was from an original script. BUT THIS IS NOT! <br /> <br /> What part of Haggard's introduction to this story is that there are no women except Foulata and Gagoola, did the producers, directors and writers not understand it? I mean, it's pretty clear English. I understood it at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial Africa, the unforgivable desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. It should be more than enough to work even the most mediocre producers. But no, they should throw "romance" into it. Pathetic. Suggestions for all your poor who actually thought it would be close to the book. Give it up. Until a Peter Jackson wannabe meets and "does it right" you can also read the tome again. BTW, there is a sequel (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives background to the story of Quatermain. It's a bit creepy but good.
