I won't take too much time here just to say that Darkman 3 is great. I already have 3 on DVD, added it to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman is up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Death, you get the point. There's not too much good horror, thriller, sitting outside. Thank you to the whole crew, and set us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you wonder how I got this one on DVD. I bought it over the internet, but it is regional 4. As you know, most American DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player as it is a regional player is. Just go to select and then choose a witch region setting you want (1-9).
