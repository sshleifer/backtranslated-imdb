The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the core of this movie. It should have read: "Be prepared to go back to the jail of the 3rd pew in the back of your family's church to listen to the minister's dreams about God's will 8 years old, all you can think of , back home to your lego '. <br /> <br /> It starts with good intent to build plot by planting some real and surreal clues like Renny's' how did the cut on my thumb so fast It becomes slow in a Christian jamboree, who completely sacrifices his plot of evangelistic-induced chatter, and I believe that using the word "pray" is about 53 times in five. minute team close to the end After the 31st I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, "prey." Unfortunately, this little thought game made me at least make the movie bearable for the last 20 Plus, it made me laugh as a character would say "prayer" ("leek" to me), because it has quite themal zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife was bored in her chair by boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all the creepy Christians who lured this 8-10-star movie, I suggest holding on to Your theology-enhancing security norms like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and more. Stay away from more cerebral challenging topic in films such as Jesus Camp, the God who was not there, who would buy Jesus, or soon be released religious. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Robert Whitlow's book is better.
