For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is just to come back and remove the bugs, inaccuracies, combined events, exuberant events, excessive exaggeration, omitted people, timeline errors, untrue quotes, wrong clothes. of the place songs, and (shameful shame) wrong instruments and other boners I just can't think of now. The bugs come fast and furious so you have to be on your toes. <br /> <br /> I didn't give it a "1", mainly due to the fact that in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it all to them (the Lennon character is credible and does a good job). Also the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at one point and it counts for ANY. <br /> <br /> So, look it for fun, but please don't take it as historically accurate.
