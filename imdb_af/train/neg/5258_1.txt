Well, I rented this movie and found out that it really sucks. It's about the family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family, then the cool boy comes with his dumb camera and he likes to take a picture of damaged buildings and strange things and strange film. And then he asks his father to take him to a side ride and just agree, etc., etc ... They go to that town nobody knows it exists. (Blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what's the MOVIE !!!! I saw a lot of mystery movies, but it was the worst. Honestly, it doesn't have a description at all and I wish I didn't see it.
