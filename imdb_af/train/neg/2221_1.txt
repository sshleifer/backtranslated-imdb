I'm sorry, but it could have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't stop. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, with his Halloween mask. The most exciting moment in the whole movie is when his parents rip off the mask to see that their son has killed their daughter. The movie goes down from there and doesn't last until the last fifteen minutes, but by the time it's too late, we lost interest in the story. There is hardly any character development, and people are always frightening about Laurie who is such an exceptional heroine, if there is not much for her. I'm sorry not to be scared of anyone with this movie, but if you want a big horror movie, watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is definitely not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, because there is no way this movie can ever make such a high score.
