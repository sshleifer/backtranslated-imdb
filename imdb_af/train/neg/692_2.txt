One of the many slides that appeared in the early eighties is Pranks just remarkable for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); Her character dies pretty early, and the rest of the movie is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> During their Christmas season, a group of students volunteered to clean up a convicted college building of its furniture. A gambling killer throws a key in the works by using the youth one by one in a variety of horrific ways. <br /> <br /> Use each tribe a slash clich√© in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a boring and unsettling horror that has prayed me for the characters to be murdered so I could continue to do something more worth watching. The majority of the deaths (which we face this are why we usually watch this kind of movie) is short and not sorry; The only real grim imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivors (there is a particularly bloody dried look? The film can have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last moment, the film spares itself to receive the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpected ending, but it's actually just one for shield finalists.
