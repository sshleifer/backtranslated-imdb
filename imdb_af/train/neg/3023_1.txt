It is scarce that I am overpowering a spectacular film, it is irritating and irritating. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, if it's not confusing and useless about flashy editing, is ridiculous. Why has Domino become such a bad hole? Because her goldfish died when she was a child and this "traumatic" event had astonished her emotionally and hated everyone. If the dialogue is not clumsy or banal, it is full of ridiculous lines like: "There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else". At one point, the bounty hunters tied a guy tucked into the back of their bus that tattooed a combination number on his arm. Due to a confusing phone call, instead of rolling up his sleeve and just reading the number, they blow off with a shotgun. At another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set off the bomb unless the mafia lets them go!? Obviously this is not going too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is unconvincing and terribly mad. Mickey Rourke succeeds in saving some credibility from this mess. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance is one, but all I could think of while having this drift was that it had been made by a complete idiot.
