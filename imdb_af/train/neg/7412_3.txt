I love cheesy horror flicks. I don't care if the acting sub-par is or if the monsters look boyfriend. I like this movie, except for the hidden feeling from the beginning of the movie to the end. Look, I don't need a 10-essay or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me. But Dark Floors takes the "what this movie is about?" thing to a whole new (annoying) level. What is this movie about? <br /> <br /> It's not particularly scary or exciting, but if you have half an hour to kill and / or you want to be frustrated and confused, hire this winner.
