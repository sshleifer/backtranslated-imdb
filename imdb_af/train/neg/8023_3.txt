After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The voice-over describes the film as surrealistic. Well, there is surreal, and there is surrealistic. <br /> <br /> There was really only one part of the movie that was surrealistic to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual images, especially the lunch where everyone is on the floor, were so stupid that they had no meaning. I don't care about images that mean nothing, but these scenes just seem irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director is trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what is going on. Unfortunately, nothing I've seen has given me an idea of ​​what Logan thinks, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he was not very happy with his physical appearance and that he had an older son. <br /> <br /> I thought the end would indicate what the relationship between the boys was, but not much different. Targeted ambiguous plays with those who were more straightforward seemed more like a policeman than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> Yet, as tiring and content-free, the movie was for me, it was a definite change. I liked a lot of Madagascar Skin, and I felt that this movie was striving for that kind of story, and maybe even style. It didn't even come close. For me there is no question: this movie deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution.
