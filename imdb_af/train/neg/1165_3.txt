I'll keep it short because I know I don't have to say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that has some appeal, of course, but I found it to be shockingly flowering from the very beginning. The movie has done very little to make the characters enjoyable and the story has become so bad at times that I have lost all interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found that Kitamura's "Alive" was nothing else - a lame, extremely boring drama disguised as a formidable action-sci-fi flick. I felt as if I was struggling to watch this movie, based on its intriguing premise and uber-exciting cover art. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Customize it for Kitamura's much more enjoyable freshman effort "Versus" or his 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... and don't get me wrong, I'm always for a good thinking man's movie, but it certainly wasn't. There was nowhere for a moment to actually care for a single event taking place in this exaggerated prehistoric, dialogue-heavy film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something, talk about boring.
