After a day at work, I sat down to relax and switch on the movie channels. The movie appeared on the guide and sounded interesting so I agreed just before it started. The first 30 minutes was enough to interest me, but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot motion made me wake up to getting food during the movie. If any credit is given to play in this movie, it must go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, don't plan to impress your friends by choosing this one as a tenant for a movie weekend.
