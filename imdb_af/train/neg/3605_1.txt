The cover of the box makes this movie look really good, don't be fooled. Splatter University came out in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but sucked this movie. the characters are so annoying. Only the teacher is cool. there is like a plot of this movie, who would ever give hell this waste of a movie? <br /> <br /> Laying coils <br /> <br /> The teacher dies here and it was a female, we all know we should have a female survivor, if you break the rules, do it in a good horror movie, not this waste.
