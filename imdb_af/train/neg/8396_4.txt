... but I also saw better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - a movie staff trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders have occurred. Three guess what happens. It's not a total bomb - the role play is pretty good with benefits John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine delivering the best performances. It's made pretty good - for a low budget movie. Don't expect a nudity, curse, blood OR gore (the movie has a very light PG rating). I was never completely bored - it is good to look at a quiet night. I watched it on video - it was a terrible hit - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Yet I have not hated it and it has a cool end that surprised me - basically nothing happens until then, so it catches you. Most popular, but only if you are a horror movie that is the best.
