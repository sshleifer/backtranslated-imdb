You know those movies you got stuck in the theater? You sit in the best seat in the house, the center of the queue in your own special sweet spot that you have replaced three times before just having the right seat - and after about 13 hours you still feel trapped, uncomfortable and itchy, think "When the F *** is this movie ever END? (You know the feeling - think of AI and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, visitor Q gives a strange variant of that feeling. The first 30 minutes were sitting there wondering when the thing was going to start! It's immeasurable! So "Arty" hurts it, this is the first Miike Takashi movie I watched, apparently making movies at the dozen and if they all pretentious is w @ nk like this, I suspect it will be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk, David Lynch is among the top 10 directors for me but Visitor Q is snooker, cheap and nasty pretentious w. <br /> <br /> As you may have already worked out, I hated it.
