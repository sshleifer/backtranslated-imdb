This movie never made it to theaters, and when it was available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For once I had to listen to the critics and pass this one. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent arrangement of actors, the movie was very disappointing. I can now see why it went straight to video. <br /> <br /> I thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush could have a little value. Everyone has done great work in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie was moving slowly and never pulled me in. I didn't develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to get ahead quickly to just end. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie, even if you just think of renting a cake. It won't even satisfy it.
