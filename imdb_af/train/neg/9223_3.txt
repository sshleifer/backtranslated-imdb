From the nepotism capital of the world comes another mess in a fancy wrapper. "CQ" tells a lame, unpleasant mess of a story that's little more than a bunch of mischievous caricatures, a baby and straight man Davies running around to make a silly sci-fi movie. I can't think of any reason, someone wants to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to make film. (D)
