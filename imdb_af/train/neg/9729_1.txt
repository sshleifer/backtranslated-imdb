Seriously, what is it? Hooper made such classic movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then he made this god a terrible movie, what happened? did he pack too much into the crack? This film is about some called Sam who has the ability to burn things, (Firestarter, anyone?) The act was illegal, the plot was garbage and the special effects were extremely rubbish. They looked like something from the 70's. Van Damme should be glad that Derailed is no longer the worst movie ever and what was the end? He started glowing blue, turned into a glowing blue blue, sucked his girlfriend's fire, and the movie ended. WHAT WAS IT? HUH? When the movie ended, I hoped the DVD would spontaneously burn to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Don't think you won't thank me later.
