I realize it's not supposed to be SCR and I can handle slow shows if they're interesting, but I find myself totally uninteresting and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for SCR was: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it will be more interesting, but from episode 3 I can barely look. In fact, it's at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week. This is a sad situation. The Syfi channel really ruined their Friday night series. What happened on Friday nights with the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG? They had a good thing there.
