To prescribe this review, I must say I was a little curious about this movie. But I probably wouldn't have seen if I didn't turn my arm a little. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie shows just how depraved man can be. In my eyes, the worst aspect of this whole Springer phenomenon is not that kind of people on the Jerry Springer Show act as they do (which is in fact reproached), but that many are so curious and excited to see them and hear about their lives (yes, I think it includes me ... to what extent it is true). If we do not glorify the kind of behavior (as some may say), we can at least subtly corrupt our minds and / or involve ourselves in this kind of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (kind of). Here's the skinny: the movie has an R rating, and although it can only earn (I watched some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I feel that an NC-17 (tip of the hat) to the other reviewer) may be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre, bringing together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and upset a group of stereotypical blacks that will appear on different Springer performances. In the end, the movie leaves one with some resolution and Springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (apparently seen through his performance). I agree with him that it is important to know how the world really is so that we can endeavor to bring about positive change. Having said this, let me just tell you - the world's bad look in a new newspaper or the news to see it, but let's not pay good money for the kind of sensational and perhaps formal titles that Springer wants us to give, support.
