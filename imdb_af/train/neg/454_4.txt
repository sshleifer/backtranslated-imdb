Generally about the designated movie featuring a strong cast and some clever dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost made it to her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never comes in its role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than a real person and that is what is needed in a love story. Cage has the same kind of performance issues in other roles that need more of a Jimmy Stewart-type character. Cage still holds these roles, perhaps because he likes that kind of movies, but his own energy as an actor does not lend himself to them, although he has been better off with repeated efforts. He has to leave these types of roles to less interesting actors who are fully committed to the film and spend their energy and considerable talent in more roles and movies where he can be his own interesting self.
