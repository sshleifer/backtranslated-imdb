Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) is witnessing the brutal murder of his father Morty (Jon Fedele) and his suicide. Twenty years later, Mike collected a group of his friends after his family's bush in the bush for a Halloween party. While playing a game where guests confess and confront their worst fears, Mike tries to call on the spirit of his old father. It is soon discovered that Morty's spirit has a wooden indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the massacre begins. <br /> <br /> Most of the F / X is not very convincing and the movie takes a cheap teenage treasure theme. Steel story acted miserably. Cast members of the note are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
