I didn't expect much to go into this, but still disappointed. This was my least favorite halstorm production I saw. I thought it was a comedy, but I just grabbed 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat man eating donuts and falling over and over again? What was happening to the keeper in heaven? Fred Willard is hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaboration, but it didn't work. They had to spend all the budget to appear in "well-known" actors because there was no lighting budget. It seemed to be filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. Does it really take so many movies to show that someone is actually shooting and making a basket, as opposed to cutting and modifying a ball that swings through a basket? I try not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real basketball game instead of this movie.
