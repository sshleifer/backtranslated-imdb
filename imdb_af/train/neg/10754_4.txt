I waited to go with the tickets in my hand, and I expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie, which could ultimately give me a movie-based appetite for robot technology. Instead, I was disappointed by every aspect its effects can't help a boring plot, which I think was worse this year. In this movie I also felt dissatisfied. Will Smith showed nothing new in this movie, but I've never seen his acting change since "Men In Black" which was my only success. He had since retired with the title "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 10/04
