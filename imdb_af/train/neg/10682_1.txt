So I'm looking for a DVD to rent and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stares James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a learned political excitement. Well then it's worth it. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. End Game has just about the most ridiculous plot I've ever had the dissatisfaction to stay. Now it's something of a madness, I can't really tear it off if I want it without destroying it for those who have still experienced this monstrosity. But questions like "Why did he / she / they do that?", And "Where on earth did they get the resources to pull it off?" is too abundant following the film's inadvertently hilarious conclusion. <br /> <br /> As far as the acting is concerned, you know those movies where you can almost feel an actor has realized that they have made a terrible mistake in signing up for a movie, and that shows in their performance? This is one of those. Guide it with a laughable scrap and severely flawed, irritating direction and you have the recipe for film poisoning. <br /> <br /> Of course it didn't make it to the theater, and for the same reason you shouldn't leave it in your lounge; it's terrible.
