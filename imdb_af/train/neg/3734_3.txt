A really clogged incomprehensible mess. Most things in the movie look around 1987, but then there are futuristic things that are just thrown in like the policeman's shotgun. And that car! The director apparently fell in love with colored lights. The only particular action was the girl Valerie played, but since there was no molded listing, I didn't know which actress it was. This one is worth missing out. Degree: F
