The Spring Years die some heavy hitters in the local and local film and television scene. And yet they can't save this movie. There are so many things about it - about acting, excessive melodramatic, poor writing, inconsistent direction; and too few things go for it - decent music, good cinematography. This comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this movie and says all local movies are bad. Please do not rate the rest based on this one movie. It is a television soap opera that is captured as a romantic feature film. My hope was high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were five minutes in the movie.
