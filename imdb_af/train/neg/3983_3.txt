Irene Dunne completed her illustrious career with this kind of film. She had to go with a bang, the classic actress she was, not in this awkward, almost unknown movie. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special. The first half is much better, as it gets pretty stupid in the second half. Perhaps Irene could see and stop the handwriting on the wall. Even her high voice became a bit annoying here. Rumor has it she was not happy with this movie. One can see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminds me of a television room of the 1950s. I thought David Nelson of the Ozzie & Harriet TV show in this movie was a very young Richard Crenna. He looks and sounds like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Overall, so-so at its best and a sub-par that ends for a great actress.
