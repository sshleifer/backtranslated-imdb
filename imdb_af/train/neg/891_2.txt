Because I loved 'Paris, Your T'aime', I expected this movie a lot and I admit that I went into high expectations but was very disappointed for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't expect a "Paris" repeat in New York, I expected the same structure. What I liked about Paris was breaking up the neighborhood. You have a sense of every director style and the story they wanted to tell. In 'NY' there is no clear separation of the stories. At different points in the film, characters from different stories come together, which has made me confused about who I am watching and what exactly is going on. Also the switch in control was clear but confusing as there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing I loved about the 'Paris' movie was the different love. It wasn't all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely middle-aged woman who fell in love with love, etc. It examined so many layers of the complexity of love between people. "NY" just seems to go for an edgy, over-the-top sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts (the older couple spent a lifetime together, Julie Christie's short), but in general, the 'NY' movie didn't evoke me. I didn't connect with any of the characters as I did with Paris. I remember watching "Paris" and having a deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hopefulness, wondering ... it had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the 'NY' movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I went on without threatening 'Paris' in the back of my brain as a comparison, this movie could have a more favorable response, but as a self-titled repetition of Paris, Je T'aime, I was very disappointed.
