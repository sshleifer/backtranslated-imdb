"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable, 'there fore-' thriller who never finds inspiration, no matter how desperately cast and crew trying. I can't believe a lot of my friends talked to me at the movie sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality of the Ronald Bass script (based on the Nancy Price novel) does not help, nor does the older direction of Joseph Ruben or the average performance of Julia Roberts. The supporting role, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, does little to help. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say. Just give it a miss. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
