I want to say the acting is bad, but I think it was the direction it made. I never thought of Highlander (the same director), but that one can be blamed in the 80's. <br /> <br /> However, this one has no excuses. People are being shot while their trenches run out with a man in front of him! These kinds of mistakes, along with an unclear timeline, strange battle tactics, sub-pairing and poor visual effects, make this one a sub-par movie about everyone. <br /> <br /> So many other comments, all this American bullshit. The German general is almost afraid of his captive American private. Be prepared to swallow it a lot, though in small doses. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, a non-horrific, but definitely subpopular war movie in all respects.
