It seems right to form, and any movie that plays Dolph Lundgren's role is bad! I don't know if it's the fact that the story is full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. No destroyer here, he looks like he is pushing and moving and grabbing and touching in this movie. In my opinion, it is a wonder that some of these projects get venture capital in the look and theater.
