From a plot and motion point of view, this movie was terrible. I looked at the watch in the theater and hoped it would end and light up after 80 minutes of mercy. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, a Son and Father, the boy's girlfriend, and two male characters of the boy's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movies and scenes suggested gay eroticism, but nothing really happened to reveal this. There were some brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the film, the boy's girlfriend appears at a window outside his room, and they make a strange conversation. Photography and acting provide an incredible temptation for the interaction between the two, ending with her acknowledging that they had another parent. End of that story.
