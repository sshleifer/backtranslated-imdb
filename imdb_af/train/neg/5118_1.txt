I am a Christian and I say this movie has terrible acting, unreal situations and a completely facade front for Christianity. You might as well see "Remember the Titans" and at least do not mix Christ in a soccer film like a formal steroid for losers. Let me make some very clear comments on what bother me in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academic school. I didn't see a single black student or player in the school. I am talking about the white "Christian" academies in the south and they are built for nothing but restoring segregation. It is disturbing when the movie about Christianity and Christ changes. How about changing the hearts of segregation? (Note: I loved the token-black coach, as it was for the all-white team and all the black 'Giants' players.) <br /> <br /> 2. The critical award by all Christians about this movie. Can I get some people to say that it was bad to play, bad filming, bad writing and short-lived compared to other movies. If we were to compare it with another soccer movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half-baked Christianity shown has made me even less meaningful than the unrealistic end. If Christianity is just about to read and pray a small scripture to begin a complete life change, do not wonder when no one will listen to what Christians should say. We want to sell Christ as a cure. He doesn't have to be sold and doesn't have to be attached to such a whimsical lifestyle. No wonder everyone believes Christianity is anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I admit that this movie may be inspiring for some people. For most it won't be. It won't give a real picture of struggle and sincere tension. Most important to me it's not Christian. It has values, but is briefly regarded as a "pull-up-by-the-bootstraps" message as a level of positive thinking. If you live next to people who are struggling and / or in the living conditions of the third world, this movie will be hollow as most churches today are in their religion.
