I hired this movie purely on the fact that the cover called on me. But as soon as the movie started, I was sorry. They seem to have used a home video camera to shoot this movie and have a young child do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try to scare people, but I laughed myself, I could have collected it myself and done a better job. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, I felt it had some very good ideas, but due to dodgy lines and in some cases they were overshadowed. It had no direction. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to take it all in, because it caused my physical pain to see it, but I always finished what I started, so I breathed in and kept it going. Definitely wasted 98 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I would save myself embarrassment because I knew you had looked at "Haunted Boat" and found something more entertaining. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but it was a big disappointment. I thought nothing could get worse after Terror Toons, but it made me think again. Stay on his genre. <br /> <br /> * From ***** (The star is for the ideas to get their worst fears for them)
