I really look forward to Nana's view of Renoir's amazing debut work, Whirlpool or Fate. I read that Nana was widely regarded as his best silent movie, so I had great hope. Unfortunately, it felt like a big step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. Her play is over, even for a quiet movie. Her acting is more like you would expect in a movie of the early teens, not the late 20s. She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that someone would fall for these femme fatals. There was nothing nice about her. <br /> <br /> The movie was also very long drawn, the work of the camera was uninteresting (apart from a horse race) and the editing was boring. The story reminds me of Pabst's Pandora's Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. Pandora's box simply counts at every level where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for Renoir finalists or very serious silent movie buffs.
