I think it's almost all I have to say. However, I feel compelled to explain my actions. I basically never saw such an armor production, and I mean it in all sentences of the word. Although the physical camera works, a Boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this movie are ridiculous, it is unfortunately not the only area. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films saved by their scripts, they have a great characterization and intrigue, unfortunately it has a terrible script, terribly acting and worst of all, terribly annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that for every independent film that gets distributed like Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie movies that have died deaths. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers at Sony know, but that can be my only explanation of how this amateur family production ever spread. I'm quite surprised why they pick it up. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie that contains any plot is its title. However, the reason is even a decrease. I hope this review will save a few people who might be inspired by this movie title to see it. I saw many movies in my time, and I was very forgiving when I was in the theater, but it was too much. I will never forget 'tunnel', to mark an important point in my theater experience. Shame it is such a low point. <br /> <br />
