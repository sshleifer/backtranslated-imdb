Here, let me move my hands over the keyboard, I'll tell you which salad she's going to order. over and over, works like a charm: he is such a genius, how do he do it? my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i scan the channels i have to be very careful (these days it is too often handy so i dont have to be broken on idiotic crap like this with that remote!) . is it supposed to be a few fascist propaganda to let people believe in some invisible kingdom of uberman and mastery? or what? why does it exist? <br /> <br /> It's the most healthy show, totally unbelievable and confronted, and I can't understand why it's still on the air. so geeks can show so much better, such a difficult time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but pass this nonsense drive. Shows like Firefly (if there was anything) falling off after a season, but bad things like this, which makes no sense, just keep going. yeccch.
