I saw this director's "Woman on the Beach" and couldn't understand the good for good reviews. This film is much like the one, two people caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. Like his other films, you should listen to a nice dialogue, blow through very little and be enchanted with underwritten, rather uninteresting characters. If you feel you can keep this movie, don't let my review stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I feel Tsai Ming-Liang's movies are much better. He has a pretty huge actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IE liked it but I didn't. Oh, well.
