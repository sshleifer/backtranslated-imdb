There is so little here from the fantastic Anne Rice book that what is here doesn't make sense. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - don't make it on screen, and those who do it are watered to the point that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the ongoing relationship between Marcel and Juliet? Why doesn't Dolly Rose appear at all, because her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest trait (and ruin) is that she can succeed for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the movie end with Marcel's knock in the hands of his father? We don't learn anything about Aglae, she is a bitch who hates her husband; Why is there no back story explaining this hatred? <br /> <br /> As far as the performances are concerned, there is not one that is better than mediocre, though probably due to the lousy script. Best of all is that of the actor playing Richard - but Richard isn't on the screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, but again it comes down to the actress who has nothing to do with how little she was given to work with. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just awful. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice book movie to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes the mess look like a critical hit. How is it that Rys is such a slut, will she allow her best job to become such a mess on the screen?
