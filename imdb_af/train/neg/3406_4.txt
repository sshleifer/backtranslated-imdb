Space Camp, who had the unfortunate luck of being planned at the time of the Challenger accident, is so lucky. The "stars" make a mockery of acting, Lea Thomson is actually turned sideways when asked for more than her usual wide-eyed smile, presumably to supplement her riotous efforts. The movie is sometimes hilarious when it asks you too much. A small boy holds a multi-million dollar robot in his closet that breaks when too many commands are given by the hordes of cliched dorm-mate. This hackneyed and unlovable machine, "Jinx", is an important player in the ridiculous premise of the movie, which is part of the short circuit, part 2001 of the aircraft team. I'm not going to give you that, enough to say you can just laugh when you're confronted with it. To say all this, it's nice to see in a SeaQuest, saved by the Bell. The romance and technology, beware, is as incredible as each other. Also, if you're a 1980s freak, it's not for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie of Temple of Doom) and of course, Lea Thompson. Also, Joaquin Phoenix is ​​sitting in a dodgy spin as a kind of Wannabe Goonie related to Jinx. Don't go near this movie if you're not a fan of the trash.
