One day there was a director named James. He brought us wonderful, exciting science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the things the blockbusters were doing and he looked at a fantastic future ahead of him as the start of computer-generated special effects landing on the movie industry. Terminator 2 gave us an overview of what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ...... and then it happened .................. 1997 ........ countless awards. ......... indecent amounts of money ............ foreign barrage of advertising ...... ...... maximum profit margin ........ Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I've never been one to jump on the train and is too critical for that reason I have often taken the opposite attitude of the majority just to get an argument. Titanic, however, was a movie I just took one positive - that of Kate Winslett is absolutely beautiful! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue was like something from Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wood than my cousin's tree house, images that were frightened were actually comic (man off the ship) falling and turning on the screw), historically fake (don't even get me started, because there are too many), it has a terrific theme music (upstairs with the guard for cheese) and the useless love story was so annoying, self-absorbing and pathetic that it met the interests of all concerned (I was happy when he died and was disappointed when she did not). <br /> <br /> It was clear It is clear from the word that this photo is designed to appeal to MTV, bubblegum cold, boy-with-car, teenage girls (DeCaprio itself seemed a little less heroic as the weedy member of a boy) hoping their sex starving boyfriends for a three and a half hour chick flag to be lucky later! The worst thing was that it didn't stop at that time. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures have seen this expensive celluloid waste because "it costs so much to produce it, it must be good" and "Steve and Barbara said it's good and they know their movies". <br /> <br /> The coronation glory arrived when Titanic deleted the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fateful night on which she was captured for three and a half hours. It seemed to me that he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune to misrepresent the circumstances that led to the death of many. <br /> <br /> But if people are foolish and sentimental enough to buy in this kind of garbage, they deserve to get rid of. Good luck to Hollywood if that's how they want to make money, I'll do it if I had that kind of chance in life! <br /> <br /> It's right there all the time, the worst movie list with other stupid, historically fake / human interest steps like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
