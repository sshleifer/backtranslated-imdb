Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among the class actors I am always interested in watching, despite reviews. I always have me. Ryan found to be a charming and popular actress in almost all of her roles. Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" because of this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Meg Ryan does not play a similar character, she plays a weak will clash that starts shortly after the opening credits on days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less attractive. So, even if you normally keep these two actors, I recommend you to pass this movie.
