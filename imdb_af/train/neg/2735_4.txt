I thought it wasn't the best re-cap episode I've ever seen (although my viewing partner gave me a tissue in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's moment ... * suck *). It was nice to see Cox outside the unceasingly fragile "Coxism State". He's in these days, just for short moments. I also enjoyed the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in the case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach can be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase / or is it Matthew Perry? talk-fall induced chemical slide (already recognized at Conan). A small lace note, the song (now stuck in my head) of the fan-induced dance montage was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
