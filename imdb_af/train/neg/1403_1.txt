An absolute miserable movie loss! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, almost any train, no secret, no interest. The constant and gross attempts at comedy are painful. All the others are pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a lot of people were stranded in the middle of no place because their train was kept for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can walk 4 miles over the dead-black fields. Umm, yes. Sure. Or they can force themselves on the railway's hospitality, and stay with the 'haunted house'. A station that apparently has nothing to do, but GREAT BIRTH, completely without ghosts, interest or plot. <br /> <br /> It's so terribly boring that it seems impossible. <br /> <br /> It should be added. to the LOST FILMS list !! aargh !!
