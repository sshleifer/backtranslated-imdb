Perhaps one day, television will be so brutal. Maybe? Big Brother` was just the first step toward Stephen ?? Richard Bachmann` King has the ending point. But enough about it. If I spend too many words on the serious background of this movie, I do exactly what the producers hoped to do by choosing this material. It's the same with the 6th day. No matter how primitive the movie is, it causes a discussion on its subject, which serves as a publicity to the producers. Let's not be introduced to it. The social criticism suggested by the plot summary is just an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative, violent film, more for video sales than for cinema. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the book. I dare not criticize Stephen King without reading him, but when I watched the film, I thought they could not make such a horrible movie out of a good book: In a typical 1980s with 1980s and music Some small actors Arnold Schwarzenegger find himself a policeman who breaks away from killers within a brutal television program. The audience is sorry. <br /> <br /> Together with "Predator", it's definitely Schwarzenegger's most stupid movie. 2 stars out of 10.
