I may not have the longest attention span, but it's the second movie I refused to see through, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought the director played a big joke, so I waited for a decision, something to laugh, something to interest me, but this decision never came . On the contrary, the writing was laughable amateur, the movie dragged and felt unheard of, as someone cut a TV series. The Academy had been on drugs when they nominated this movie for at least eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie I refused to look at completely. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 10/01
