OK, I found this movie in my dad's old stack of movies and it looks good on the cover, but the movie actually sucked! OK, the first story with the swimmer was pretty good, but it took a while to go in, then one with the boy was completely delayed! It wasn't even scary! His dream sounds like a little child's bedtime story. Then the news girls were also completely delayed. I'm sure someone will call the news press and ask him to go with you. But that one got cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on. He said everything that messed her up. Next was that nice gay story about the man who brought the dead people back. I'm so stupid, I'm not even going to talk about it anymore. The last one was the best. It wasn't that scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool. Yes, the girl is taken possession and she kills all her classmates or something. Then the losers will be on the bus to tell their dreams to each other (to heal AHAHAHAH) and they see all the people of their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
