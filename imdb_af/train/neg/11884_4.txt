The world's biggest inside joke. The world's largest, most exclusive indoor joke. <br /> <br /> The emotion of the brash and everyman humor of office space drives this film the appeal of this movie into the ground by making humor so that it would only be appreciated by legal secretaries who book write. The audience is asked to accept the unknown role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the turbulent dummy player. <br /> <br /> The entire film is centered on the law secretary who finds leisure time, listening to music, and a novel while working. These are his goals. You can't think the slap in the face is for the audience when they walk halfway through. He got a job that meets all three criteria, but then gives it UP! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the audience's motivation to suppress or even entertain a protagonist. He previously discarded what he complained about the lack of it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that big stumbling block, legal secretary insider humor fails because they have to be explicitly explained to the audience every time they happen. Without this one, the audience would not notice anything special. Humor is only effective if it is not thoroughly explained to the audience that is funny.
