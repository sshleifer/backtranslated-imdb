This is a scientific fiction video of formula B, and the director made no bones about it. It's about a dragon that is being restored to life by a scientific team. Everything that has been done is what you have seen many times. It's a bad script, with no real characters. In fact, it's full of stereotypical characters and situations. The director quotes it by making it just a formula film, with no attempt to trick us, and it gives this film a soft appeal, but it's not something you will probably remember for a while. It is best seen while cooking, cleaning, working out. Kind of sensible fun. It has its place in entertainment, but it's definitely not something you sit with friends to watch, unless you're all just drunk and don't care. The mass score of 3.2 is probably fair. I don't think it's as crappy as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the posts think it's spectacular. It really deprives me, because I see no attempt to make it even a memorable movie.
