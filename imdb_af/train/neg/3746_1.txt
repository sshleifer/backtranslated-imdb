Just as difficult as I believe, with all the terrible reality that has been there over the past few years, one has to take the best place for the worst. I wonder if it was just a spoof done by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, he would be sure he was behind this. Can a rock group be slightly lower than what INXS does such a shameful thing as it does? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition a lot of karaoke rejects the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band joins the ultimate act of pathetics by exposing themselves to a bunch of talented wannabes to be the new lead singer of a 20-year-old band. So they treated all these terrible singers (I thought American Idol had part of doozies) making imaginative versions of just about every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then they cut to the INXS band members who seriously discuss the merits of each of these candidates. You can see better (and more original) rock movie players at just about any nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual unconscious elements of every other reality program. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, a host / emcee, a 'judging' of performances, and a participant's lame startup at the end of each show. Can these shows become more predictable? This is clearly a publicity stunt on the side of the band; a last hope of hope to restore their lost observatory before finally being buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he has a little dignity when he lives, has to roll into his grave. Not that INXS was ever a big group, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If INXS is completely representative of what rock and roll have become, this show will be the final proof that rock and roll is dead once and for all.
