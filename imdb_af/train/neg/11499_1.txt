Gadar is a very silly movie because it tells a false story. It is too unrealistic and is a typical sunny film that aims to fight Pakistan. The film's aim is to trick the viewers into thinking that Pakistan and its government are bad, but trying to hide their own mistakes will not work. And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad. Most likely, the Sikhs will love the movie because they are being deceived. The movie sucks and sucks with power. I just think Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10, I would be the lowest 1.Please save 3 hours of your life and not look at this stupid, boring movie. Disaster.
