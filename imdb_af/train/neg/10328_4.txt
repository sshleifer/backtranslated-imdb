I think the show had a good concept to work with. But the performance was poor. The writing is poor and acting is bad. There were many problems that could be better portrayed, such as the protest against gay marriage or the cemetery. The show can't be called a comedy show, as it unfortunately misses humor. I must say this show was hardly successful in making the life of the Muslim community to some extent. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first one. I had my hopes high on this show, but I was disappointed. Yet, I appreciate CBC to draft such concepts for viewers. Anyway, I wish you luck for the future.
