Which boob at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place the sturdy Clark Gable in the role of a rescue army worker? Ironically, another handsome future star, Cary Grant, also played a Salvation Army man two years later in the highly-rated SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I think of the background, it's pretty easy to see the folly of these roles, but I'm still wondering. WHO thought the Salvation Army guys were "HOT" and who could watch this dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. Long ago, I was working for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the Volunteers of America) and I NEVER saw any stingy guys there (and unfortunately it includes me). Perhaps I should rather get a job at the Salvation Army! <br /> <br /> So, for the very curious, it's a good movie to watch out for, but for everyone it is bad writing, messy dialogue and annoying moralizing for a very slow movie.
