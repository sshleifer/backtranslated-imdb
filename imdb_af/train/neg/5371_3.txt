This movie was quite a disappointment. After the very slow, very intense (and very gory), the movie begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and I come from the theater. I wondered what it was all about. The characters remain level, the story is not convincing at all. Most of the articles are not without parody, and there are a few cheesy parts. As the young police have to dig up a body. Of course it's night and it's raining and he has to do it alone ... yawn! Whether the Manifestation of Evil is "Nazi" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. There are, however, some nice bits, such as fist battles, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can) it's definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
