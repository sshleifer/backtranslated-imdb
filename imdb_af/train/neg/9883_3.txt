Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Top Derek at 16 looks good and sometimes gets naked. She does a very good job with an immature, unsafe 16-year-old beauty. <br /> <br /> 2) Many shots of a beautiful Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> 1) Peter Hooten is in the worst performance by an actor Brutus Caeser's friend played in the "Roman Senate Proceedings of March 15". He delivers each line in a beautiful baritone bellow. Turn the volume off when talking. Preferably all the way <br /> <br /> 2) The fantasies of the past are unfortunately soft, especially according to today's standards. A few turns in the bath and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is skimpier than top costumes
