I'm really starting to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how foolish its films can be. This particular movie was a complete and totally waste of time to watch. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they tested his picture and made him look leaner and younger as if he were in the movie. He had his big pot belly and double chin for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous to start with and has gone out too long. The whole film was up to the final where Seagal and his team had to use a lot of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline amplifier. There was also a way of very useless dialogue and not the ridiculous and constant doubling of Seagals's voice in the midst of a statement. The confronted voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was rather comical. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes in the movie were terrible. Be the time when Seagal foug ht you couldn't even see what's going on. There will be sharp shots of him flaming his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something. It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television. They used too much slow motion for battle scenes. <br /> <br /> I believe it's Seagals worst movie to date and I'm glad I didn't buy this movie, or I would have been very upset since I was a big fan of Seagal's Aikidoist. The action star quickly disappears and gets worse with each performance.
