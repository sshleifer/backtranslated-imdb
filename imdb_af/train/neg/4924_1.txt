This movie is really bad. It may be difficult, but it is. It really is. Poor writing, every vampire clich√© in the book is used, and no sympathy is entirely given to the origin of the main character, ie ole Dracula. There have been some brilliant Dracula / vampire movies in the past, but it doesn't even make it into the "dire" slot. <br /> <br /> Take a selection of people who seem to be out of a teenage move, add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix a happy tonic of religious / surreal daydream ... and you get a confusing mess of a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I'm really unable to get good things to say about this movie, as if it's not bad enough that it was made in the first place not, Johnny Lee Miller seems to have an English accent ... what's the problem with that? you cry ... Well, he's English, but he sounds like an American trying an English accent. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can also say your money (if you wanted to buy it) or rent it out, see it, and discover for yourself why it's as scary as the Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
