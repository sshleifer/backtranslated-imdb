It's absolutely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would say that the play was very good and by all the role-players. <br /> <br /> It was apparently meant to be very unfair, and it succeeds. At the same time, the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe, which is a clueless, talented chronic liar, whose source of confidence comes from a few leather slippers. <br /> <br /> It was worse than watching a car wreck.
