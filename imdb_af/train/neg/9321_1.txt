I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a movie from a b-movie, but ended up with a faecal matter for my eyes. The acting was similar to grass drying. I acted better in a soft film ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a crazy killer coming out of nowhere surprised me. How was it a horror movie? <br /> <br /> This film's production value was at best ridiculous. There were no frills. It looks like a high school student has been given a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if it existed. If you're bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are much better b-movies out there.
