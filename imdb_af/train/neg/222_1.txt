As a single woman older than 40, I have made this film extremely offensive and humiliating to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman of any age. It was a sad, pathetic effort by a man to write and direct a "chick flick," and it failed. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to get started with, but the non-existent "plot" (I hate it even as a plot) didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy or empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or credible. And then there is the mandatory male fantasy of an attractive straight woman who suddenly decides to give lesbianism a try. PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want to have 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.
