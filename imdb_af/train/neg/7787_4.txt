This is one of those films that is more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I do my ratings based on how much I enjoy or amuse the movie, so I give it a 4. If I were to consider it as an academic film, it would get a 10. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a very interesting way, like a pseudo-silent movie with elements of sound effect and reality. It is meant to convey ominous memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in this respect. <br /> <br /> However, the film has many disgusting elements in not finding all those entertaining things. They are mostly just disturbing. It also has very interesting images, and some interesting concepts, but some of the character relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this movie will also dress you or it won't. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it wasn't a good look, and I probably won't come back a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you're looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
