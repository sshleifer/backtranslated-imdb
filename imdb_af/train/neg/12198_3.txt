With the Transformers of Beast Wars I am not very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I have seen the fantastic movie and now I have seen the older cartoon based on it, I have to say I love the original cartoon and the live action movie more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I don't like the BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORMER AND ROLE OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime makes me strong believer that he is a true commander, more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Besides, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look at the web! <br /> <br /> BW character Megatron was more like a humorous version of the more malicious version of him in the original series. <br /> <br /> Apart from being cooler, robots are turned into animals or robots are changing. in vehicles and space ships? Gimme the original Transformers any day about Beast Wars!
