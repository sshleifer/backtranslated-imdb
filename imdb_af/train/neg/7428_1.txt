As usual, on IMDb, with the majority vote instead of the "weighted average", it's much more indicative of the movie's entertainment value. In this case, the majority gives it a 'one'. How right they are! To begin my review, I will first admit that I'm completely clueless why this movie is called "Alien Intruder". It involves space and even an "alien" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason for something in the long run, no real plot base or resolution I can make anywhere. /> <br /> There are quite a few scenes that are so horrific (regarding both lines, timing and how they are spoken), that it is the strange feeling you get when you see similar bad movies, far exceeded. I don't have an idea of ​​that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny looks about something. <br /> <br /> The "plot" involves only a space known as the G-Spot, sorry, makes that G-sector ... and a virtual reality program contaminated with a kind of alien ( ?) virus. I think it's alien, because the image of the otherwise normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the movies we see that people are being shot with space weapons, falling out of the sky, and seemingly endless, useless close shots of "Where's Ariel?", "Can't find Ariel" (useless because most of the other shots include NO interaction with Ariel, anyway - whatever) on a computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee), watches every fantasy of the sentence's VR programs hoping to find this Alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on how to work in despair. We know this because he spends a lot of time hitting his fingers over his face and looks sad. <br /> <br /> The doctor's scene with the nose of one ship entering the back of the other was semi-hilarious at least, and a laugh for the early scenes where we saw several shots of the ship, as it just turn in a circle, and look a lot like a Lego experiment went wrong. <br /> <br /> It all seems to die in this movie, so why bother? Even the VR women are killed, as if it were supposed to mean anything (especially because everyone died anyway) ... excessive. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I save on groceries, I won't rant over repaying my money for the DVD of this. The dollar I saved on the bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer's time. <br /> <br /> I'll just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with much more detail added, could probably be very interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
