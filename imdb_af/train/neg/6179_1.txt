This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or any other important detail needed to portray a story. This 'movie' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his masculine side and the 'difficult man he really is'. I completely wasted my time watching this movie. The best part should be the end credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut down my thumbs and thrown at the producers. Whoever, in their right mind, gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film is, of course, on the same spiritual level as he is. Finally, don't waste your time watching this movie, it may be the only thing you regret.
