In 1967, myworkers found the remains of an ancient disappeared civilization called Abkani, who believes there is the world of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something bad happened before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, government paranormal research agency Buro 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who did orphanage experiments. Currently, one of these children is paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just found an Abkani artefact in South America and is being chased by a man of abilities. When an old foster friend disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and leader of Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team are fighting against the evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite a charismatic role, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Dark" never works and is a complete mess without the development of characters or plot. The reason for this can be explained by the "brilliant" interview of director Uwe Boll in the DVDs, saying "video games are the bestsellers of the younger generations who are no longer managed by books". Furthermore, his target audience will be between twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I find both allegations to be disrespectful to the younger generations. I have a daughter and a boy, and I know a lot of their friends and they are not the kind of stupid stereotype the director says. Furthermore, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Your Boll is absolutely wrong. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark? O Despertar Do Mal" ("Alone in the Dark? The Awakening of the Evil")
