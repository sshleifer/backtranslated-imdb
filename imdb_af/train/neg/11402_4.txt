Exactly what you expect from a B movie. Derivative, free nudity, sow in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better acted (definitely) better written, directed, etc. But then I think it wouldn't have been a B movie. The actors sucked, and it was just like an episode of buffy vampire slayer or anything but with lots of blood, curse and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be singled out. She is absolutely the screaming queen of the new millennium. Not that play really matters in these movies, but she was better than any of the other actors. She is also warm in the plastic jumping suit she wore for the whole movie - wow! Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit, I mean it every time she turns around, you can help but watch her out. And near the end of the film, the viewer is rewarded to see her completely neck. <br /> <br /> So if you're a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself), watch it out. If not, you should probably avoid at all costs.
