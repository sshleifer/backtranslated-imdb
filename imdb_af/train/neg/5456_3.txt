This is just one of those horrible movies you find on Lifetime TV that empathically portrays the horrible behavior of some disgusting women. Along with other so nasty films like "The Burning Bed," "Enough" or "Monster," this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man, and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you have made a picture of sympathy and empathy with this person? Answer: Hel nr. <br /> <br /> Imagine switching the generations in this movie, and then you will see why myself and myself consider it a worthless piece of garbage. If the sexes switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we will probably be treated to a painting of a monstrous and horrible man preaching on a young girl, his capricious action leaving him in prison, and suffering his broken victim to Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this movie is because of her sex. <br /> <br /> Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Flat and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. She is a criminal who is in prison and deserves mockery and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.
