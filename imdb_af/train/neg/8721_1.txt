I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. The little girl was brat, they were not nice characters and the plot sucked. In addition, it wasn't even a gator like the movie we want to believe. If you check any complete reptile guide, you will find that it really is a crocodile, not a gator. Obviously they haven't hired a real animal expert, or they will know that the creature is a crocodile. This is a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this one.
