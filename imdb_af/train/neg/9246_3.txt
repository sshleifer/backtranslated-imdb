I refused to see it when it was originally broadcast, which set the memory of the late, complained 1960 series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I needed to know better. No longer a remake, and more of a parody than a tribute, this show did not quite know how to play it, and with childless comedy and cartoon characters and characters. The three main characters were a bit more than caricature of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act. (Bob Mortimer is painfully in a straight role). The supporting role-play was merely comic acquaintances of Vic and Bob who wanted to be part of the in-joke, and too aware that the situation would be convincing. And the CGI, although the effects couldn't improve 30 years earlier than those available, only attacked the viewer with lights and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue. All style and no dust. (And while the 1960s show was mocked for most of its time, this 'update' is now very dated, with 'Matrix' style fashions, mandatory 'girl power' scenes, and less than subtle tensions between the two live clues .)
