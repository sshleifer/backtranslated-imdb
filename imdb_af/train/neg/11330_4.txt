"Giant" is one of the most boring, too many Hollywood contests ever. Many scenes look completely fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are being wasted in this great Hollywood production. A central idea of ​​this movie, that a farmer will ever spoil oil on his country, is absurd, and I know this because I'm from Houston. A few scenes, especially Dean who serves Taylor coffee, release this otherwise boring movie. For a much more accurate and interesting presentation on how modernism has changed the ranches in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show."
