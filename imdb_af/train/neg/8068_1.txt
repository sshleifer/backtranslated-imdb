I didn't have great expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 at the video store, but the box has at least a small promise with its "killer cut" of "more gore! More sex!" Shown. Can't go wrong there! Well ... needless to say, the box is a fraud. How did the actors and actresses of this caliber record in these witches for a film that is so low? <br /> <br /> It all starts with a drunk college girl going out of a frat house or another building, and so useless shit says to her boyfriend (?) like a camera at a bad steadicam follow her. Then she was chased by some man in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. They cut her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they cut her so that someone crawls the cuts with a chalk. <br /> <br /> From there, the same theme of the chasing girl is repeated / illegally killed by two guys for about 84 minutes. Add in a tit shot. These are Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have had a problem with this movie if the box didn't fool me into renting the movie. If I hire a bad movie claiming to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! One full apron in 85 minutes of a chick that is clearly ominous and gore that will not frighten a child cuts it. If it is the Killer Cut, what is the Theatrical Cut? Of course, I doubt that this garbage took place in the theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this movie. I could see they made their screen debut here because they didn't do anything yet, but they were all settled before it was released. I don't know if it was filmed before they were all settled and put the studio on the film until they were semi-big names or not. But what I want to know is .... did they really spend $ 14 million on this movie?
