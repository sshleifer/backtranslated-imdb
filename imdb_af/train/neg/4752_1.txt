I heard many stories about this movie that was good. Well, I took my chance when I saw Ebay at a cheap price last month. <br /> <br /> I watched it and I have only a few comments on it: <br /> <br /> 1) Terrible story line, 2) Terrible acting, 3) Bad fighting ... <br /> <br /> I've never seen a worse movie in my life far !! When the storyline is bad, the battles make at least something more interesting. But both are ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks nice in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about it ...
