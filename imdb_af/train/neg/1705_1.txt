A horrible amateur movie director (no, not Todd Sheets), explores his new friend and sister a cave. The friend and sister fall in and are saved. Meanwhile, a gang of terrified girls are defending their 'peat'. Whatever the slope means. This movie and I use the term VERY loosely so bad it is good. The humor is painfully unfunny, the "action" is just sad. Now I have seen some horrendous horror horror movies in my time and in my approach to watching low-budget movies, but I still openly cry to anyone who prefers to pass through. ONLY for the most hardened maschists among you. but the rest is running fast! <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
