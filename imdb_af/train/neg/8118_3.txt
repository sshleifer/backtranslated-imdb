Well, EYEboy, I have to say that it's nice to me not to end when someone identifies me and tries to make me, especially if someone is as intelligent as you do. My favorite part of your post was: "But not a big scary good old, bad guy, here, kimosabe. <br /> <br /> Well said! I do like action flicks, especially if they're done well, but I also like movies that don't have much action, as long as they're done well. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies don't fit in that category and are just a very bad movie. I really don't see many non-American movies, so maybe I was spoiled and didn't realize how bad foreign films really were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Perhaps if I judge another standard of foreign films, one day I can see how Secrets and Lies might be one of the highest rated movies on the IMDB. Hmm ... If that's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
