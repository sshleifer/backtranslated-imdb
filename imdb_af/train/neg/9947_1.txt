This movie was terrible. I swear they didn't even write a script, but they just winged it all over the movie. Ice-T was irritating like hell. * SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to see it * They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. He could have been away long ago. The soil was difficult, it would be impossible to find him with dogs near him. And when ICE-T is on the Hill and use that Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as a sniper rifle (and then cut off a tree with eight shells? It will take a thousand shells to cut a tree that size.) Shotguns and handguns is considered inaccurate. And they even saw the reflection. What has the light? I didn't see a magnitude on that thing. Even when he was shot and kept in the intestines, it was delayed, he would be bleeding to death. Plus The end where he splashes a rock or a cigarette into the kitty. It won't blow up and kill him. The bullet will still make a fire, but open the tunnel.
