This movie wasn't horrible, but it was pretty bad. the acting really was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a good thing as the crazy scientist, which is kind of his specialty if you don't know such things: D. Bill forsythe .. Well, I'm not exactly sure why he was in this movie. He's too good for these kinds of things, and his role wasn't really demanding. I rented it to the two leaders, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, it's a movie about half a man / half shark. It's not people from Shakespeare. Unlike the plot, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, I would note that cinematography has also left much to be desired. There were shots where they were trying to look, "cool," but it eventually darkened the scene or just came out. They also sounded it many times when they had proper dialogue and cut off early before the person could make the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, it is worth checking out. He gives a good performance and does what he can with the character. It is not bad, as is the female head. Heck if I can remember her name. Besides, I won't waste your time otherwise.
