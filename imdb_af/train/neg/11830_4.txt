OK, maybe a 13 year old like me is a bit too old for this movie. It's about this indulgence, which lives in a palace. Then a sewer rinse him on a toilet! He ends up in this rocky city and meets this girl's rat who has a jewel that wants a greedy frog. He will do anything for this jewel, he sends a whole army to these two rats. He plans to take the jewel and flood the rock city! The cool part about this movie is the snails. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, it's great, it's also pretty funny. OK bottom line, this is aimed at 7 year olds. Another way, a good movie to see a younger family member. I didn't think the animation was actually dream art, but more like WAllace and Gromit. I hit a little about it. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $ 9.50, though it was a pity.
