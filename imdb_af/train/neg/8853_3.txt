In the first Howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in that movie made sense; A TV reporter examines it and tries to expose the truth. She must kill many of them, including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then they show the world they exist by transforming on live TV. The special effects were just nice in the first movie and they didn't get any better in this one. Whether it's the transformations or the bad dolls or the cute computer graphics that show the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not so bad; they must kill the werewolves leader for some reason. It won't destroy all werewolves and it ends the threat of werewolves if not ... they just want to kill her. I think there were some clouds for this reason, but it really gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the movie we end a 10 minute show of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader shoots her top and exposes her big breasts while some Devo esquire bands playing a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even viewable is Christopher Lee.
