I just rented and watched this movie just to see what all the fuss is. So here's what my reactions to it are. It is easy to see that it is a low budget movie with poor actors. The main plot of this movie is about a woman who gets revenge on her rapists. This concept, if done right, can easily be a very challenging movie. The shock, however, didn't scare or disturbed me at all. It just bored me. This movie can easily be shortened to less than 45 minutes. Many scenes are mainly there to fill in time, such as the natural paintings and some scenes I have described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find the rape scenes pretty soft. I don't know if I watched the cut or uncut version if there is such a version. I also found many plot holes in the already poorly written plot. Here's a list above me. <br /> <br /> Why don't the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walks out of her house to find out what the noise is. It will be an excellent time. <br /> <br /> Why don't they just rape her, not delaying some of the rapists, the pleasure and extension of Jennifer's ordeal for so long. It will probably be more shocking and so disturbed. <br /> <br /> I really found it stupid that the rapists left her in the bush and went back to her home. Perhaps to show that these rapists are really impeccable. <br /> <br /> At least these rapists should know that if you want to do a dirty job, they shouldn't send a coward to do the job. /> Why did Jennifer not call the police when the rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that appears in most people's minds, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why didn't these rapists stumble away from the sky, miles away seeing how Jennifer was alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really wonderful that a slender lady like Camille can draw a man tree and hang him. *********************** Ends spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, this movie is not without his merits, Camille Keaton is beautiful and I hear one of the funniest line I heard recently when Matthew protested to go back home and kill Jennifer, "Why me? Why me, I did not once you had !!!
