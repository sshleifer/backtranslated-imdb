I didn't even know that this movie existed until shortly after I saw Blade: Trinity, I was spinning around on the Trinity board when I saw some users mention how the West Craven series Better than the crap, it's Blade, so I did my quick research: Checking the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension and somewhere alongside the search, I realized it was a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that in the West Craven Dracula boards there was a very strong following for this movie which is a great contradiction with the scores I see. <br /> <br /> Now let's take a quick personalized recipe here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I don't remember it at all, and when I saw Dracula's scores, Ascension just dropped my expectations, but then I am the kind of person the movie itself has to see. (any movie) so I can form my own opinion. <br /> <br /> A few things I've gone to know when I start watching this movie is that it's low budget, so I'm going to ignore a lot of the v / fx and just see that it is remunerated by story and acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the decisions in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> ?? This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can at least entertain, I find it nice, the bad sound sync of the re-recording of the dialogue in some screens, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basics, Luke even had a book about it, but didn't they want to deliberately 'get infected'? No, it's the worst thing about pebbles where the girl should come out of the shower and see the sound she hears with no more than a towel. <br /> <br /> At some point I must have clipped. because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' had clothes on his body, especially since he is big and wild and I see if I was in that situation, I don't want to be the one who puts him on. <br /> <br /> So does the movie end like any middle film of a trilogy? That doesn't mean, instead, it's a 'Cliff Hangar' where I now have to wait for the 3rd installment 'Legacy'. O the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
