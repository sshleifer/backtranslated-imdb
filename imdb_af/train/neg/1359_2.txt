A good throw is unfortunately wasted in this slower than molasses and randomly bought comedy. Peter Ustinov is trying hard to bring something to life, but the result is a dour drill that misses all the right beats that made it possible. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this movie is terrible. Poorly targeted. Poorly edited. Poorly acted. Poorly written. You have to put in a hundred movies to get the one so bad. <br /> <br /> The hidden and indifferent plot relates to Ustinov, who enters his way to a US insurance company to hook up their computer and obscure millions of pounds. . How he does this is beyond lameness and credibility (he only learns his computer skills overnight by reading some pamphlets, and Hoodwinks captain expert Robert Morley goes to South America and steals his identity). <br /> <br /> As a side plot, Ustinov romances co-lone Maggie Smith, who just happened to be his secretary after he built an apartment in her building. She ends with the part of plays that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart who doesn't go anywhere, while Ustinov goes to get the money a bit and tries to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he is Marries Smith and they fly to Brazil, which has since become the staple football of almost every British barber comedy since (Nuns on the Run? A Wanda Call?) <br /> <br /> The surprise turn of an end is more laughable than anything that has come before. By the end I thought I should really be my tumbler to stick it out like that. Even a cameo by Emperor Romero didn't help it. One of the most unknown, poorly-crafted "comedies" I've ever seen, and definitely the worst caper. Don't waste your time. If you like this, you should see better movies.
