While "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" is usually cited as one of the worse films ever made, this 1959 Mexican movie is so bad that it "SCCM" looks like "It's a wonderful life." You have to wonder what the people who made this movie thought; Perhaps they meant it as a third world allegory about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah. . . They were just not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. (Perhaps it was the inspiration for "Freeway.") Back to the "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas lives in a satellite in geosynchronous orbit (shades of "MST3K"); Instead of elves, his toys are made by children chosen from around the world. and he has sophisticated spying equipment to watch just which kids are naughty and beautiful. The result is like an Orwellian outer space sweat shop. It's enough to keep you off Christmas forever. These and other low-rent Mexican children's films were dubbed in English and distributed in the US in the early 1960s; No wonder the sixties have become such a turbulent period in American history. The baby boomers who are forced to endure these "family" films as children will be too eager to become revolutionary.
