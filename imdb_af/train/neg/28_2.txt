This movie is terrible. You don't really have to read this review any further. If you plan to watch it, don't do it (unless you're studying how to make a good movie). <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ... serious amateur hour. Throughout the film I thought it was interesting to find someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, just to find out that it is really him! A new layer, even for him! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim to be original or good have probably never seen a decent movie. Even at the standard of Hollywood action flags, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Don't see it !!! Rather go for a jog - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.
