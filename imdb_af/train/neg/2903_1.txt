Oh, dear. This movie was titled "When shriters strike!" What a stinker. I had a lot of hope for this, mostly after reading IMDb reviews, which I wonder about the whole IMDb rating system, but it's a separate issue. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc. so I expected good things. To say I was disappointed is the understatement of the year. There are so many things wrong with this movie, but I will confine myself to (a) the impossibility of any family acting like these people. (A mass aerobics workout? Which planet is that real life?), The clunky script (a killer of love?) And the fact that Dan's character is so unlikely, you find yourself wondering what the girl in him seen to fall in love with him? This movie was filled to burst with some dialogue, creaking, ridiculous plays and it was slow, slow, slow. We would have walked out after half an hour if we were not with my parents, who didn't go out much and didn't like to waste money. Unlike the makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the money spent spending this movie into a bonfire - it would have been more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid it like the pest.
