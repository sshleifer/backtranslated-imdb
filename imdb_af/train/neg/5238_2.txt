I do not understand the positive comments made about this film. It's cheap and boring at all levels and I can't understand how it ever was. <br /> <br /> Characters in the characters are abundant - Sue's dirty mouth, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father is an excellent example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except briefly, to Sue's Asian boyfriend, but even he seems to be able to have domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they are both, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would throw themselves on a perfect crawl like Bob - but if they do, why should I expect them to care what happens to them? So many reviews are about how "realistic" it is. If that is true, it is a sad reflection on society, but no reason to put it on film. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie at all.
