if they gave me the option of negative numbers, I would use it. This movie was really god-fearing. I went into the theaters and expected it to be terrible, and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The writing was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to leave, but my friend was in charge and wanted to earn her money. I think we were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The growth of the breasts when the girls have their super power and the hair has changed color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just looks wrong for the part of the super villain, he comes down as strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came as psychotic and strange, such as Matt (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson).
