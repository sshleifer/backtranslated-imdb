I saw this movie on a western American flight. It was so bad that it actually looked like the flight longer. The plot had potential (who would not have a movie about a woman accidentally killing every Elvis mimic she meets?) But it has a million different times scared by very poor writing. Towards the end is a frighteningly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino that resumes heaven and thinks he's going to return. Then a group of stars move together to form an Elvis constellation that immediately shoots a bolt of lightning from the mimics, and sends them through the roof. Bad ... VERY bad. What is the theme for the whole movie. I will avoid this one at all costs.
