I think it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a movie like this. With the sometimes relentless remnant of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene without explosions, dirty language and choppy one-liners. Minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when properly employed. However, this film is not one of the cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogue and arid, sparse landscapes. I'm sure they should take some great meaning and insight, because the implied message is shrouded in bafflement. The play is poor ... lean and pedestrian ... and features one of the worst homes in history (at the end of the movie, if you can put it to the end). The scenery is dead, and the ridiculously long end of the girl walking through the barren park is so pleasant that a tooth is pulled. I would call this anti-climatic, but if the film didn't build on any kind of climax ... not even in the "erotic" scenes, it would be untrue. I'm sure there was a screenplay during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it could be written on a cocktail napkin. This movie basically offers nothing of interest or surprise ... no wonderful story, no impressive insights, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three entertaining moments, this movie is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and brave movie.
