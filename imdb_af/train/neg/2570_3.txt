I read that "There is a girl in my soup" came out of Peter Sellers during the low period. Looking at the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. The presence of sellers and Goldie Hawn seems to help the movie; Don't do it. The whole movie looks like they have just filmed randomly what happened without writing anything. Perhaps I haven't seen every movie of middle-aged people trying to be hippies, but this one gives such a movie a very bad name. <br /> <br /> Overall, both Sellers and Hawn star in much better movies than this, so don't waste your time on it. Pretty worthless.
