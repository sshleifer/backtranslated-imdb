I saw better teenage wolf flies in my time, but this one takes the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" places the "c" in cheese festival. The star quality in this movie is not bad. Just as it was made, it just sends in the mountain. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an all-American high school footballer of the 50's who eventually does not get aging due to a werewolf bunt in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violinist. He hit everybody! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink that is not the best of his game. After all these years, Tony has been very out of place because of the attack, and then he gets the chance to catch up in his state. More laughing than bloodshed, this movie is just beginning in the 80's, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement from this! 1 out of 5 stars.
