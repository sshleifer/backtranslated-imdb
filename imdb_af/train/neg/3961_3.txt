What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is pretty good, but it is amidst a jungle of abhorrent script writing, mediocre direction and wood that is made up of most of the movie. Many of the characters are terribly disgusted, especially the ever-overstated Colin Friels. Very little work in this pretentious garbage. Much of the "character development" is done by a stupid, anxious voice and often endures the behavior of characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to even figure out who's talking about the voice over, because they describe so many characters we see on the screen! How are we meant to know Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be a volatile, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these stupid voices tells us. To cry out loud, the character of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin's voice! The right killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite being constantly reminded that they are meant to be artsy paupers. They are all absurdly speaking for "junkies". No one has a true understanding of life on the slope or on the screen, yet it is the case with most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip doesn't pay more attention than a weekly TV movie matinee. Crud like this, perfectly shot and technically presented, but a clich√©-driven angsty drama so widely shot to think and about ten hours without going anywhere. At least Noni gets her birthday package on every given occasion. There is no other reason to endure this litter.
