In what will be his first screenplay, based on his own short story "Turn About," William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice and many strange relationships. The story was only about the Tone, Young and Cooper characters, but MGM had to put Joan Crawford in another photo to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner had to create a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same cut style as her co-stars Young and Tone. This leads to very unintended hilarity, as these three communicate in a telegraphic shortcut that resembles a Monty Python ("Wuthering Heights") sketch in semaphore). The almost utterly fewer sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects famous Faulkner themes, with an almost unnatural close relationship between brother and sister (as found in his "sanctuary" and elsewhere). When Young proposes Crawford, in the presence of Tone, instead of an engagement ring, ALL THREE exchange their children's engraved rings. The proximity of Tone and Young is also striking, especially if they go to their Thelma & Louise lot. Frankly, it's creepy. <br /> <br /> Not so creepy for this New Yorker, but as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford had to catch up on!) and Young turned into a gladiator. Sheet metal toys. <br /> <br /> It is said, there are some good performances. Young is especially busy with a scene where he was shot in Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flying friend. Tone, in spite of his inability to express himself through a realistic dialogue, has ruined a moment, his own fiery tears over his friend Young's destiny. Crawford, also stripped of meaningful dialogue, usually comes across as wood or melodramatic. This is quite a balance for one role. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes - not surprisingly - for a Howard Hawks movie - are the most exciting part of the whole picture. But not enough. As for me, it is 75 minutes of my life, I will never return.
