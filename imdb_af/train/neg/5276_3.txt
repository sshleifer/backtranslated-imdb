No, it's nothing about the fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy-tale grandmother and the glass-dressers, but if I worked out, I'd have to spoil it for you, which I won't. But don't get curiosity the best of you, because this movie isn't great. It is one of those movies that is promising, before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline. And this is real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. Man is a successful plastic surgeon, while the other is your diligent, obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like gloves, so you will think of them more than brothers and sisters rather than older ones. But things start going wrong (not always) when Hyun-soo's friends, on whom Yoon-hee operates, begin to bark. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's a warning for audiences, and for those Korean ladies who don't bat an eyelid when they're going to be under the knife as news reports. The only frightening moments are those screens in plastic surgery, although I somehow thought that Kim Ki-duk's Time was actually more gore when describing and describing what was going on during the operation itself. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two halves, the fist is an attempt to shock audiences with standard frightening tactics, which I have acknowledged from time to time. The second half, however, degenerated into a senseless mumbo jumbo melodramatics, and it was well under threat to force his ideas into your throat. Some things don't make sense, and while efforts are always suggested to explain, you probably won't buy it. Not the horror movies are logical to start with. <br /> <br /> The leaders are all beautiful and there is a clear shortage of male presence besides the insignificant police spokesman. But hey, I don't complain, though the storyline could be greatly improved. I would recommend watching it, just if you're a mediocre Korean horror fan on VCD. Watch out for those moments that are face!
