The producers of this movie offer funeral expenses for anyone who dies while watching this movie. They had to offer intensive psychotherapy to anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. A young couple move into a house where a woman who resembles the wife of the couple lived. Extremely boring, and very predictable. In the end, I didn't care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs.
