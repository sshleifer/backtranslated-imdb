If you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas come from the UN, Israel and international affairs, look no further. <br /> <br /> It's not a supernatural Hollywood-based movie. Biblical section. Instead, this movie was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a movie, the end result sometimes looks more like clips from a television program (complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while playing harp). <br /> <br /> For mainstream viewers it can be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as in the movie. And that may make the movie important. You will probably not find a more concise explanation of the bizarre view of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So, if you see it, consider it a social / cultural document. If you are skilled on all media, you don't have to be warned about the unusual propaganda and manipulation efforts in the movie.
