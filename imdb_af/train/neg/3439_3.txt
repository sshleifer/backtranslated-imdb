***** Probably minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can't say I like it, but I can't say I didn't ... it's very strange. It has bad things in it like a shark that has come out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can think of. If I were the director, I would definitely cut it, gave me the urge to stop watching the rest of the movie. .. For some it will be boring because it does not have action, sometimes at home ... For example, take a scene that one of the friends died and the next thing they do is what? nope, don't cry ... they tell horror stories to each other. * Suck * (just after they cry for the lost). <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat, they were like "hundreds" of candles in the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some kind of rain curtains (old laps that cover the windows) and sofas / couches ... I thought it was stupid, used candles but not thinking The environment, except being alone in the high seas ... <br /> < The good, some scary scenes they did well, I liked from them. Sometimes horror is better if it is hidden if it is behind something, rather than pointing out, so this movie does well, maybe because it is a low budget I don't know, but it works well for me! You will feel stressed if you forget some holes like those I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much from it! But if you watch any movie of this movie, be patient, try to enjoy. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry about my raw english) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
