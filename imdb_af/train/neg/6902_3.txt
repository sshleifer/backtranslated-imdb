Despite the huge reviews this movie has received in New Zealand, any hype around the production is unfortunately undeserved. Apart from a click-only plot, the movie is dropped by some poor plays, accents and complete lack of tension. <br /> <br /> Although the general look of a large budget (for NZ) has felt the small town is definitely Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Didn't anyone see the brothers? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who have, will pick the agreements right away. I heard comments that scenes such as boys playing basketball etc were shot to make fun at the cliché. crap ", but it comes across as forced ... <br /> <br /> I believe Oscar Keightley considers himself so ironic, but again his delivery always remains vaguely self-conscious. <br /> <br /> Anyone doubts left over by the Samoane living NZ culture, hopefully not permanent, affected by American speech, culture and everything in between, will definitely make their minds at the end of this movie. Robbie magazines always look good on the screen but are dropped by the script. <br /> <br /> It always rubs me in the wrong way when a "comedy" scene is set up on such a front obvious way, you feel like a good company at the clichéd punchline - see the white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this movi I'm screaming, but that person has the brain of a road pole and would struggle to spell her name if he offered a million dollars. <br /> <br /> The kinda sum up the mentality of this movie but not great, fun, but not funny ..... Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5-star movie despite all the glowing (middle-class white debt? :-)) Reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? If you see it, get drunk first!
