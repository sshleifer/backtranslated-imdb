Many days after I saw Conceiving Ada, I'm still upset that any group of people will spend so much time making such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> No one should watch this movie in the hope of learning anything. about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. <br /> <br /> Similarly, no one should watch this movie in the hope of being entertained. <br /> <br /> As a science film, it would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the main character succeeds in bringing the past to life and communicating with her on her personal computer - with the advice and encouragement of Timothy Leary's words. I doubt anyone can suspend their unbelief enough to keep it from seemingly absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> As a drama movie, it would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages twenty-five minutes with constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama about nothing. I doubt anyone can feel that all the drama in the film is just an annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to fully express my contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances under which I saw it prevent me from leaving the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have otherwise. I'm still angry that I wasted the time it took to see it. Just because I could criticize this movie more effectively, I wish I was more articulate.
