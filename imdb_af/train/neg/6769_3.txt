A failure. The movie was just not good. It has humor that is 5 years old that doesn't even giggle. I mean, some parts were amusing, but most of them were not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and she has to work on better movies. The movie had to be sown as an original Disney Channel original movie. This is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. Nothing like a redesigned sound soundtrack to brighten your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave it a ten, 9 would be the music and 1 would be. the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack.
