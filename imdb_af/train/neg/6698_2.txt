To say Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible relationships. I can really get into a good house movie, even a surreal and twisted skirt like El Topo, Naked Lunch, and Survive Style 5+, because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll. <br /> <br /> FFFC strives to be every floor as deep and intellectual. In essence, there is no substance in this movie. This movie is badly done, the footage in this movie is not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie. I slapped for GUITAR BROTHERS, but it was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant. It tried to be deep and meaningful, but it is just pretentious disoriented nonsense. Varsman film students without a camera can make something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar brothers and the uplifting routines between sketches get 1 point each, everything is just bad, pseudo-creative, heavy-handed attempts to get as good as movies by other REAL directors like Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky be. Give me a chance. I am convinced that people who desire FFFC do it because they have no idea what they have seen because it was nothing but lightly relevant statements mixed with stupidity and mingled until you cut your own shoes no. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great disappointment. It comes from the height that Survive Style was 5+, a movie that actually has meaning, combined with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialogue, funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic pacing and flow. FFFC has the exact opposite in every way, boring scenery (20 minutes staring at a bare beach at night? A completely white stage? Alienballs floating in white space? A little school hall and then a school walk?), Terrible cinematography, forgotten dialogue, nothing funny or humorous, except the fact that you wasted your life for only two hours, soundtrack, amateurish performances, uneven, unfounded, and often flat-out pacing, zero flow whatsoever. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim it is what makes FFFC a big movie, that it is so unconventional on every turn that it is pure genius. It's simply a way of harming your own ego because it's unpredictable that it can be a good quality for a movie if it doesn't go with "boring", "inside" and "terribly". Personally, I spoke to two people who admitted to me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelmingly rave by the elite of the art house watched them again and then returned to me with a ... " Hey, it was pretty good, I like it. "<br /> <br /> I'm going to repel my foot, this movie is demolished, I don't care if Roger Ebert says this movie is the best thing he ever watched since he loses his own virginity. "The Emperor's New Mantle" I say ... this movie is not an indication of the other psychedelic / trippy films that have come from Japan over the past 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even with a low budget), and no one can honestly compare to Survive Style 5+. Just look at FFFC if you're interested in making a pretentious stack of nothing on a shocking budget.
