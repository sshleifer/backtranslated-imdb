I still read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I meant to do. I'm sure it should be scarcer than this movie. I remember once when I saw it that day, though I couldn't recall the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and I watched it on DVD, but I'm sure the theater had to be a wonderful sight. After the first few special effects were done, I waited for a story to develop. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie should be at least loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. I was in the movie of the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the film because it was nothing else to look at. Lili Talor was such a sucking character. I didn't love her one bit, something about bright people. Also the man in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I couldn't relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson tried an admirable job of going through this movie with some kind of play. <br /> <br /> Half to three quarters of the way I just die to see a camp, Friday the 13th or a Shout Queenish movie! There is at least some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story, they fill it with at least greedy deaths or attractive females. It had nothing. <br /> <br />
