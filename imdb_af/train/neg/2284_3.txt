Now I won't deny it, when I bought it from eBay, I had high expectations. It was an incredible print from the master of comedy I enjoyed so much. However, I was soon disappointed. Unfortunately for those who enjoyed it, but I just found the Compleat All to be very difficult to watch. I did have a few smiles, but most of the funny ones come from the music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was basically stuffing. You can tell it wasn't Al's biggest video performance (the honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt it will ever make the jump on DVD, so if you are an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just have to own everything, buy the band from eBay. Just don't pay too much.
