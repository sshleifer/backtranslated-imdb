Ronald Colman has won a best actor Oscar for showcasing performance as a popular step-up losing himself completely in his roles, especially as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-acclaimed George Cukor movie has a wonderful pedigree, written by the treasured team of Rut Gordon and Garson Rabbit. Unfortunately, the witty villain comes here as self-conscious, and the backyard business is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when Colman theater speaks to her unceasingly, she asks him: "What are you, some kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is very obvious, surprisingly thin, and not very funny.
