Ten minutes of story stretched in the better part of two hours. When I half had no meaning at all, I had to leave. But, ever hopeful, I stayed. And left with a sense of guilt because they wasted time. Acting was OK, but the story line is so transparent and weak. The script is about as lame as it can get, but again, issuing the ten-minute plot doesn't leave much room for good dialogue.
