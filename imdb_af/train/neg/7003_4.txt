(aka: TRINITY IS MY NAME) This successor seems to have been done to capitalize on the outstanding European business office success of MY CALL ME TRINITY. Only this time, Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy photos wanted it in America as well. They did not get very far, as the Hill / Spencer photos only achieved marginal success here in the US. This largely boring, stretchy film doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear by their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful outside men and care for each other. They later become involved in gun dealers who smuggle rifles out of a monastery, and mistakenly think they are some federal agents. It all comes flat, despite some funny scenes, especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a French restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. And the screens with the card sharks were also softly humorous. <br /> <br /> The opening title music sung by Gen Roman sounds like an honest Bobby Goldsboro-like early 70-year-old pop song while the music channels sprinkled through the movie are pretty good. Not sure if I want to buy the CD soundtrack, but some other power. <br /> <br /> The movie could have blown about half an hour and it wouldn't have dragged that long. . There seems to be a lot of scenery here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2/3 of the way through. The DVD is also horrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that seems to have been sent to the big screw room in the air. <br /> <br /> A big step from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
