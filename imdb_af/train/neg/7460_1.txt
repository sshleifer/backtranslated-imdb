Corky Romano should be one of the most jaw-making and horrible "comedy". <br /> <br /> While Chris Kattan, who is sometimes wonderful, has drawn a very funny show in the hilarious Undercover Brother, his character in Corky is so stupid and so unfunny-what is a shame because the point of departure is a wonderful idea. To bad they ran out when they came to page 3 on the script.
