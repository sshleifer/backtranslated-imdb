I saw bad movies, but it took the p ***. It doesn't make sense, and all the characters do swear every few seconds, o and I think one has a low sperm count. It's so good. A Welshman plays a heavy cock. A good English block plays a dirty, unresolved villain of rice, and some small lights play dull tarts. <br /> <br /> And there are a few Russian gangsters. Oh, yes, somebody has a gun and maybe talks about garbage while it's high on drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
