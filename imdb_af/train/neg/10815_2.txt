I love the book, "Jane Eyre" and have seen many versions of it. Everyone has their strengths and their mistakes. However, this was one of the worst things I saw. I don't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerant and definitely watched the ordinary part, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I couldn't imagine what Mr. Rochester seen in her. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane, if possible. How two such indifferent people fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not keep me in mind. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. <br /> <br /> The Timothy Dalton (too attractive for Rochester!) version is much more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A / E version (which is not all true to the book). <br /> <br /> Try to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was in her role perfectly.
