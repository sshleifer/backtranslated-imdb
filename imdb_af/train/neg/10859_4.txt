This is yet another of the many B minus movies that are labeled as film noir, hoping to create interest in something that is lacking. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The action by the three leads is wood. I think John Dall was expected to place places in the film industry, but then someone realized he had little talent and therefore did TV work. Lee J Cobb, who is usually awesome, can't rise above the poor writing and poor direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatal, but is nowhere near to convince the viewers. The movie has two of the strangest cars I've ever seen, the one in which John Dall goes to Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. The DVD transfer is typically Alpha.
