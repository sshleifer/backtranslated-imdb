The book on which this movie is based has seriously changed my life. But to say this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting, directing, cinematography and storyline were all terrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I told countless people about the book, but now they'll tell them everything they definitely shouldn't see the movie! I didn't expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they left too many key components of the book. The movie tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspirational message and only gave the central theme of the prophecy. Having put myself in the position that did not read the book, I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoax B.S. I'm very disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie turned out.
