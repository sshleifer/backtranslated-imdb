... they seem to mislead people to see features in this movie that just aren't there. <br /> <br /> At Dark, the same area covered, but with much more class and action. <br /> <br /> why the script kept their 'big secret' so long was a total mystery to me - I recommended it to the breakfast scene at the beginning of the movie. By the time it was revealed to the viewer, it was just a big issue, telling me something I don't know. <br /> <br /> I found it to be meaningless movie that challenged the genre. conventions, unfortunately, those conventions are that horror movies are tense and full of horror. It was a pity
