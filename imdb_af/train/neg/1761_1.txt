First, I realize that a "1" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets it from me because, as one reviewer shows, it's not bad in a self-conscious, top-of-the-way way that allows it to have a bit of comic or cultic value. It just misses its point on every score. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialogue is completely unsuitable. The continuity is so deliberate it is painful. Daniel just ends with his lost love, and with his last word the flamenco dancers start. The shock of her name (see? I don't even remember her character's name, let alone the forgetful actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) first told her her friend was the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle hunt did all the right things. Vegetable carts flew. Cars fall into each other. Motorcycles go down the stairs. People are almost hit, but remarkably, nobody is. Oh, that's right ... except for one guy who's been stabbed several times, it's obviously with knife wounds along the curb, and an approaching car apparently didn't see him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It's becoming increasingly remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the movie industry to make money. You'd think someone in Hollywood would think of watching good movies. Now there's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Don't see this movie. Don't rent the DVD. Don't look at the cable. There are many other things you can do that will make you feel more satisfied.
