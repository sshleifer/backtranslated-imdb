It is a movie of tired but oddly childish, clich√©. There is a Nazi witch-master who performs sp-related experiments in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> The general impression of the film is an immature notion of anxiety. I don't have any expectations, but I have an old Xander from Buffy and a heroine with a monkey-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act. Along with Adrienne Barbeau I first encountered "the much more pleasant" Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death. <br /> <br /> Camera and editing add to the overall impression of Lame.
