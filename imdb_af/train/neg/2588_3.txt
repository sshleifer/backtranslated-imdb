Band Camp was terrible, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise looks the same quality as its predecessor. Actually, Erik Stifler (John White) divorced his girlfriend after losing his virginity. And now Mike and Cooze Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joined by Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) at the college. With the promise of many parties, plenty of liquor, and plenty of hot chicks at the Beta House, they have only fifty listed tasks to perform to become official privileged members. But a threat comes with the opponents, GEK ("Geek") House, led by a power-hungry nerd (and sheep shagger) Edgar (Tyrone Savage) who offers bigger and better than Beta. To settle it once and for all, Beta and Gek go into battle with the forbidden, for forty years, Greek Games to defeat each other, with the loser going out. The last game of the games, Noah Levenstein, ran Jim's father, the only regular Eugene Levy. The people see the bras, a gladiatorial duel that floats on water, a greased pig, Russian Roulette in the mouth with patterns of elderly horsepunk, a woman wearing a drunkard alcohol and drinking (with thanklessness). It's all in the sudden death, with a guy dancing a lap, and they have to resist cumming, Beta House wins when Edgar cums with a girl dressed like a sheep on his lap. Also the lead role of Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The nudity amount is very slightly increased, just like the coarseness of the jokes, and I can guess it's one star out of five, but I like it. Sufficient!
