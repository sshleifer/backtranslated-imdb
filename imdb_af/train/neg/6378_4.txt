This movie was sometimes amusing, sometimes hell was funny. <br /> <br /> However, the underlying message I got from the movie was that women are responsible for all the human problems. Every time a woman is portrayed in the movie, she is lazy, becomes a slut or a poor guy for a clear reason. I don't think the message in question is good for women or gay men. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art so it's just some kind of perspective. Even if I don't agree, they're still entitled to it. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie, but some of the comments made by others, is just stupid. Best movie ever my foot.
