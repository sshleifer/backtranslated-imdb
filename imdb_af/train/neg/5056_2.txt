*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - the usable play of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is terrible (it is not associated with the horrific script). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by French Tumbuan). I laughed my head as he expressed his "anger" after losing a lot of money; terrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and she "is a hostile takeover" line (that is the rest of the title of this movie) has been conveyed so badly as you could. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress has distinguished himself / herself in this movie. We come next to the plot. This should tell you everything you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a city center teacher. Now she is a C.I.A. agent (or was it another government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad I didn't even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What has your previous work experience? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Good; you are hired! I just give it a "2" due to a decent performance and a nice plot turnaround (though we know Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be caught).
