a very good storyline, good excitement about it ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? well done and a good story that has been destroyed in the last few seconds ... sorry to say a 1 in voice ... that's what it deserves, I think Chris Shadley could get a better end. .. but maybe Next time :) All this meaningless blood has done nothing for nothing? the end would add the story to a 10, but it didn't .... the end has ruined the whole story, I think most people are not paralyzed and when they go a movie, you want a good end, even if it is complicated ... but the only lamb here is the end ... sorry
