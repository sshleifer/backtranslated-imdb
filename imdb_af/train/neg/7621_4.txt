As noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail", along with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the different versions, this is my least favorite. The problem I think is that the studio has crossed the Stars charisma, which doesn't cut it completely. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leaders never comes into this movie. There are no real sparks. From Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day-old donuts, pleasant but gentle. And if the leaders are boring, the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She didn't seem to have a neck! I don't know if she had any problems with pain or something, but she looked like a tortoise trying to pull his head in his shell, pulled it all up and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was so hot. I would have made a bee line for that cute violinist. And Van wasn't good either. I've always thought of him as a fairly generic Hollywood leader and he does nothing to expel the image here. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the stars or early 1900's, then you might like this movie. But there are many more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouth-watering, chosen outfit.
