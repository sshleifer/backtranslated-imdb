Movie begins with 3 people meeting each other in the bar. OK. They talk about their imaginary lives, and lie all the time, without reason. Still OK. From time to time they even make you laugh. Interesting. First 30 minutes you really enjoy! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, if something happens, all you can see is naked old "ladies" touching each other! Not right. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but it's all but it! Film has no sense, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular by research, of course, before people watched it! I even thought (before I looked): "Hay, it might be interesting, though it's a Russian movie!" But, God, No !!!!
