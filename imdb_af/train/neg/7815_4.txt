As a prolonged fan of Superman from the comics, the first two of Chris Reeves movies and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I * was really * smart with 'Superman Returns'. <br /> Instead, we made Lex Luthor a different * attempt at real-estate conversion, another Superman-beaten-while-wearing kryptonite sequence, and internal contradictions: he couldn't stop himself in the ocean when it is held with 6 "of kryptonite, but if Lois 3" breaks it off, * the rest has embedded in him *, * he * can light a continent * in space? Really, the only hero in the story was Lois's mate - I can't remember his name out of hand. He did all sorts of lifesaving, heroic things, with nothing but complexity and skill - no superpowers, no invulnerability ... just a normal person. <br /> <br /> They still make Superman so small. Why can't we fight Superman Brainiac or fight to save General Zod's universe instead of Lex's small-scale schemes. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I think I'll stay at Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should, too ...
