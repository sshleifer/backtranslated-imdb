But we can see it ... it has some nostalgic sighs from me. <br /> <br /> The performance is just as consistent good that it can have a few brackets. I get a new season, and may only have 2 days to live by them like me. I like the idea of ​​making it up, but it was much more of an episode of the season that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox is not supposed to be naked for a few episodes, the only explanation I can think of is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to start shooting again. <br /> <br /> And that my friends, why hell is bare. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is awesome ... bring on the 7th season.
