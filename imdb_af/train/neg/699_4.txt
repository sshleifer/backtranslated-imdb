Probably one of the most breastfeeding slasher films ever, poorly performed and badly written. <br /> <br /> The plot Five students staying behind the holidays include a dorm, but someone has designs on them and starts killing them. by one, the main suspect is the flu farmer John Hemmitt who is played by Woody Roll, or may be one of five characters. <br /> <br /> Acting Not so bad, it's not that big, except Daphne Zungia who dies too fast and had to be the main heroine, and the rest is very tough, although Laura Lapinski, the main heroine, sometimes her charms, and you finally feel sorry for her. <br /> <br /> The KILLS can't really see why they banned it, the manslaughter seems to mostly fail, one man cut his hand half in the beginning, which looks really fake, but the other is rather nasty as one girl overflows her head with a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another is burned alive. <br /> <br /> GENERAL Not really a good treasure chest I was much better
