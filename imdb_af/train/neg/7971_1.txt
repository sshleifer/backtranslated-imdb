I'm not sure who does this <br /> <br /> glowing reviews for this movie, but trust me STKINKS. I saw hundreds of horror movies and slasher flicks and this one is LAME it's just about 80 minutes long and believe me that's all I can take. Plot is terrible, acting even worse. And there is nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Even the David Cocteau movies are better than that. Run away from JIGSAW. I expected to hate the play, which can be forgiven directly to film films, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> It didn't have any frills, very little Gore, <br /> <br /> and a real, unattractive. <br /> <br /> I watched it with three other friends <br /> <br /> who I still hope to talk to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to have the disk out of the window. I can't believe anyone <br /> <br /> could give this trip a good review.
