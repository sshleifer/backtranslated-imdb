What starts out as a soft-landed, unsatisfactory and generously-pleasing romantic story, changes pace as Edward Norton's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals himself and things are turning to the sinister, as the movie is gradually from a southern novels modern wildlife changes a famous farmer (Norton) wanders in town and charms a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), who apparently saves her from a dead end with her badly married dad with a storm wind romance, but that gradually becomes clear that there is more to this cowboy than to the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? A true chameleon actor (with changing facial hairs to suit), plays a rural shop, emphasizes slightly dodgy, but perhaps because he's just trying to act on the part without worrying about the accent. He definitely makes it impractical to make all the animated little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes it means we are never sure where Harlan comes from, and what seems like a good performance by Norton is gradually becoming confused. Evan Rachel Wood is nice, without ever doing anything other than her eyelids at Norton. <br /> <br /> In the valley it falls as a slightly uneven story due to its change of pace and never really the protagonist's motives clearly make the audience's sympathy for the characters remain uncertain. Should we keep this drifter or not? Even after a dramatic event, it remains unclear. This ambiguity is for the film's disadvantage, as if the writer could not imagine what kind of story they wanted to tell and captured a bit of a flashlight. If the movie stayed one or the other, it might be a solid movie, but if that's what we're left with, it's a mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the movie, but are turned off by the darkening tone. Complementary fans from Norton aside (or supporters of the lush landscape of the San Fernando Valley), give it a miss.
