"Feast of all Saints?" Where ...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Was the Feast of All Saints worked out story and theme? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never something in the story that is most related to the "Feast of All Saints." There is also nothing in the story about "All Souls Day" that refers to the term. Why bother to use this title if you never intend to include any sort of story or theme about "All Souls Day" or the "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Scandalous Bad Script & Amateur Writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such a great talent for this clunker? The writing is so amateur - characters who know each other their lives go into large, long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience. Not like people talking to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the director thinking? <br /> <br /> Directing is just as bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateur. In one scene a character calls "Take your hands off me" and no one touches him! The worst play, however, is the incredible over-the-top battle scene at the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> Excessive gore in a very fake, dumb bad scene <br /> <br /> There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit !! You can see extras waiting for their indicators to walk over the camera. Everyone plays their dying scene like 4th grade boys - exaggerating every little sparkler. The blood on victims was so excessively and carelessly applied. It looks like someone has used a ketchup dispenser and just sprayed straight red trails on the costumes. <br /> <br /> This whole battlefield comes down as the ghost of a real cheese war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and give the punchline. <br /> <br /> Who in the real life will ever do this? <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous piece of writing, directing and decisive is actually the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is standing under the body of her hanging dad - who gets terribly mutilated, and literally dripping blood forms his gaping wounds. Even a completely idiot will know he is dead! Yet she - very monotonous - repeated over and over "Daddy, Daddy ..." while looking at someone on the screen. She produced it with as much credibility and passion as you could expect from a non-actor who repeated the whole room to the cameras. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor kid had any acting, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl won't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of bloodshed - surrounded by hundreds of bodies while she's quietly standing there !! Natural instincts would scream and scare the child away from the bloody massacre! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be frightened or laughed ...? <br /> <br /> A particularly fine detail, showing the scene a SNL satire, is the dad who hangs, with a big hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! The inadvertently funny details make the whole scene pass by as false and stupid. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Land, mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you see a central character - the girl's mother - at the end of the scene and in the next scene that occurs 20+ years later, she looks exactly like that. the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost turned the movie away because the direction and writing were awful - but I tried to stick it out because I wanted to see the Louisiana institutions and I love all the actors. I don't know what these fine actors think when they accept these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> The excessive amount of blood and poor performance in the opening scene is out of place with the soap opera storytelling that follows. It is also a strange way to start a movie that is aimed at romance novelist reading for the rest of the time. Weird contradiction in tone!
