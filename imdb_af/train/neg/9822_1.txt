There were times during the movie that I wish I had been beaten to death. The only reason I endured the whole movie was because I couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it should get better. It was really a horror movie. I was shocked to have messed up like 4 hours of my life that I will never return. The other two hours I had been mourning at the loss. Please recommend this movie to whom you want to torture and tell them the tension will kill them.
