Oh, dear, Jerry can be the undisputed king of talk shows, but the movies are a very different ball game, and he's out of his league. The screenplay for this film is so poor, it should be seen as believed and it is sad to have so vaguely known actors like Michael Dudikoff (80's action, B'movie King), Michael Jai White (Last seen in the Sci Fi flop ) to see. ?? Spawn 'as well as the Survival of the Games' William MacNamara (involved in the only half-funny situation in the whole movie!). If you're a fan of Jerry, stick to his TV show because it's a total of one and a half hours. After sitting through it, I got on TV for the last half hour of Rocky 5, which looks like a movie story. I think it's more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
