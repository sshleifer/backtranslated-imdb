"In 1955 Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared into the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle ... naked. It took him 45 years to go back." Suppose, "Keep the river right" is "a modern cannibal story". In fact, anyone seeking insight into cannibalism will unfortunately be disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a New Ginuea travel book, mostly native art. The second half relies on pictures of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but it really is about it. Unless of course you are interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum who introduces his former male lovers. I give up. Great disappointment and not really a modern cannibal story.
