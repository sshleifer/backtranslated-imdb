This is one of those movies that could have been good. The basic premise is good - immortal cats who kill to live, etc. - Kind of a variation on the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> The thing that drops it all is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive. See how long it took to catch the Unibomber, and that was because a family member figured it out. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the child (and to a lesser extent, the mother) behaved as if they were untouchable. The child kills without a thought not to leave evidence or a trail or living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and discover for a month is incredible, let alone decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame - it could have been so much more if it was probably written, to give the main characters the level of common sense they needed for so long. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, not a bad performance. I loved the bit at the end where every cat in the town converges on the house - every time I walk out on the stoep and watch our cats suddenly enter where they were, I think of that scene.
