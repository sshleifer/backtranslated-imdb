OK, I admit I watched this movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I'm not one of the people who automatically give a MST3K movie a 1/10 score. Although I hate a lot of the movies they play and some of the worst movies I've ever seen, I actually enjoy some MST3K movies. It is said, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (It's no wonder the MST3K authors have told themselves that this was one of the worst. Don't believe me. Look at their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is a good example of what NOT going to do film processing. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, cinematography is pathetic the way (while it may be the best thing in this movie) is bad. <br /> <br /> The pacing is the worst part in this movie. A few times in this movie, the viewer literally had to wait minutes for something to happen. While minutes may not sound like a very long time, it may be in a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was just very bored. It really feels ten minutes. <br /> <br /> As "suspension of unbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie", it has a lot of it. But the SCROWS is just as awful, I might even be interested in anything that actually goes on in the movie, and so the "suspension of unbelief" was indeed. <br /> One of the worst, and probably the most boring, movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
