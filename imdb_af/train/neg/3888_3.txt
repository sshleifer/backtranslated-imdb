I started melting so I would make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There is this astronaut, and he gets up with a spacecraft with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens to expose him to radiation, and then when they return ... well, no matter what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut started to melt! No, not just burnt, but MELT! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well, okay, maybe it's not that fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he gets everything red and dirty, and the fact that he is melting makes him really angry. I think he also checked the handbook of "melting man" because he suddenly knew that in order to completely melt away, he had to eat human flesh so that he moved people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important is who will he hit next and what will be left of them? How long will it take him to just melt away? WHY was this movie made in the first place? Where did they get the money? When will you fall asleep while you see it? <br /> <br /> I almost melted, but I still have plenty of time to tell you that this movie is really boring, even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross. The makeup is neat but everything else is ... SPLAT
