I agree with most if not all previous commentator Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement. <br /> <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 have not yet been released on Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The story line was complicated, and was a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines. At one point, I wondered if I hadn't seen a repeat of a previous Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was disappointing as it began to depend on effects (a roll, limbs cut off, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All the previous films have been successful on the storyline and action and have achieved a good result without using effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope the remaining Zatoichi movies will NOT follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi movie from his studio. I recommend all previous Zatoichi movies and recommend them.
