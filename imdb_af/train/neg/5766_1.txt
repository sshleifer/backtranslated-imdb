It was supposedly the flagship work of the open source community, something that would rise and shout around the world's media while not falling into the marketing trap, with our options for delivering good work with open source tools. After downloading the basic version (the hard fan here on a dial-up modem) I finally came here and hit my first night. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & Winamp couldn't open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & koffieine didn't open it on my suse server. Mplayer managed it smoothly. It will be difficult to spread the word about it if normal users cannot open it. <br /> <br /> The Film. Beautiful soundtrack, excellent lighting, masterful camera work and flawless texture. Everything really looks. And then the two main characters moved ... and talked ... And the movie died for me. Everything but the lip synchronization and the real animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene) looks fluid and completely alive. The two main characters were so poorly animated that I sometimes wondered if there were games on the market with cuts that were less realistic than that. <br /> <br /> Any frame in the movie is fantastic .. as a frame, and the thing is great or actors don't move. I'm so glad I didn't recommend it to anyone. I'll ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy has a more consistent and cleverly designed plot. <br /> <br /> This movie will get 10 stars if not for the tragedy right on the screen.
