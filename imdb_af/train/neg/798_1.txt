OK, the movie is good, but I give it a 1 because the idea that a computer virus becomes an organic virus is pure fairy tale. This kind of crap just adds to the uncomplicated savvy moron's paranoid illusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, strings code and dozens 1s and 0s add to computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even if it is tinier. Although considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, add the organic virus's attachment to your cells and attach itself to the RNA and then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how such a monitor can be processed? Perhaps the radiation has an effect on the user's cornea that changes your eyeballs in these viruses? I could see it, but of course the author didn't think so.
