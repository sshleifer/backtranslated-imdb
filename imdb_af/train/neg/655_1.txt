I made it with my hopes, with twenty minutes in the movie, I couldn't let go. Despite the thought that it would be another terribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe ... just maybe someone will get it right this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night is on the same level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad writing, bad direction, overly exaggerated scene and generally bad horror. From start to finish, it is boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eyeglasses. We've seen it before and we've seen it do a million times better than that. If you're going to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd like to wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because the laugh will be. The laugh is not on points in the movie that is supposed to be funny. They are in response to important "exciting" moments in the film that is so weak that you feel like watching the latest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was it supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The filmmakers missed the point so badly that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked about halfway through the movie. What I wanted to do in retrospect. Not me, but I had to torture myself and keep on hoping it would be better. Needless to say It didn't. The horror scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting, but because of the direction, the writing, the special effects and the camera work. The movie may seem to have spent a fortune producing it, but has still come out with a micro budget. I expected halfway to see dollar store labels on some of the props and thought I'd see a porn star somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> These movies scary alright, if it's the future of big budget scare, then the horror genre is doomed.
