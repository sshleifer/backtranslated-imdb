If you've seen the 1975 Sholay, don't see this movie. If you haven't seen the 1975 Sholay, go it. But don't look at this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that may have gone wrong with Sholay's recovery. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best (probably the only 40 minutes of the coil not to be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch Amitabh play with his character, it would still be worth a watch. But as insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal doesn't do his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely ordinary and the only reason I think, throws Prashant Raj into the role of Raj because he has a striking deal with Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen carries herself well, with grace and make-up. But the award for the "WORST performance and any role to date" must go to Nisha Kothari. She manages to decay her acting to such levels that even the high school drama would surprise her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)
