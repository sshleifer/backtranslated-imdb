I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> I watched several documentary documents about him. He is, of course, an intelligent man, with great knowledge of films and passion to make it, but makes him a good director. Definitely NO! A full anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned features, but a film with actors ?? Never! <br /> <br /> He can't write directly. His scenes are full of bad thought situations, and many situations / dialogues in his movies are so childish and bad that they cannot be hidden behind the word "art". Not at all. Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. To say he wants to write so much and write such a crap is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene when Scheitz is arrested and Storszek hidden in the back of the store. WHO IS KIDDING? <br /> <br /> He is a fraudster; he knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he should put in writing to get your attention and empty praise. Remember the rest of the writing and messy direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, then I can re-examine his old movies and try to find talent in it.
