I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After I saw it, I could just return to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has some new story elements, although it never really rises to the level of interest. This movie has all been thought to be a manufacturer for the drive theater market - ultra-low budget, amateur play and a liberal dose of sex (for an early 60-year-old movie). In fact, I wonder if the only reason the movie was made was a quick goat and because someone had some strippers that they could use as extras. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girl's cut head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model - whose only real purpose in the movie is to titillate because they remove most of their clothes. However, they are too fond of making the movie even worth the look of the naughty pieces and the movie is not terribly scary enough to watch merit through bad movie buffs.
