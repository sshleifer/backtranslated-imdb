I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's seemingly insane obsession. There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe it's a good quality. Overall, however, I found this movie surreal and ridiculous. The handmade movie show, along with slow motion and other movies, I have become clumsy and dizzy, even sick. Overall, the music is really awful and repetitive to the extreme, and I also remind myself of the psychological warfare of the US Army against various malcontents. <br /> <br /> The various vignettes made by the film are random in their placement and unfinished and unresolved in their content and "conclusions." A depressed movie (not a real _film_, a term I keep for real art) left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the different people who try to convert it as a "romantic comedy", although there are certainly isolated elements of both of these films in the content, form and conclusion of any fellowship with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest you stay far away from the seemingly overwhelmingly positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources.
