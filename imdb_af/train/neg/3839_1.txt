Some movies are so bad they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as true as the Pinocchio's chances of becoming a true boy. The scene was terrible, the direction was poor, and it was traveling too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to do it and went home with him. <br /> <br /> Also, Melissa Joan Hart never attacked me as a talented actress, but then every movie she made was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she puts her characters down by pushing them too much, talking too fast, as if her words are making her more dramatic. She really feels that there is a crew in front of her and she talks to a camera when she has to involve the viewer in her character. It pretty much makes the whole movie, and any bone it might have had to stand up to is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Probably, the only good thing about the movie is when it's finally nailed. But even that wasn't enough to suppress my aversion to such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in film is milder than a piece of dry toast.
