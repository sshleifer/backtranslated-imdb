Drawing Restraint 9. Dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious movie? Is it that there are only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of the movie? Is it when Bjork wears what looks like a giant hairy pita on her head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Perhaps when mammoth and spine columns are used in a whale blubber experiment. Or, if you're done killing the composer for making a minimal, and still annoying, version of a Philip Glass score? Drawing Restraint 9 is, in any case, one of the most pretentious of modern art films. At 135 minutes, add it to his prediction by starting boring. I would call the use of color scheme, and the opening sequence is interesting, but the rest of the movie looks like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. This is until they seem to be trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but it will come later. <br /> <br /> In fact, the documentary-esquire portions were the best part. The superficial is about a whale ship, and then there is a ritual about making whale fat. Then there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship by a ritual of humiliation, including successful head shears (think frat boy pranks), nicotine patches and giant hairy pita hats. Then there is mutual judgment, cannibalism, and we can't forget the huge thorn. Matthew Barney wrote that it is about the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity. It's almost like saying, "If you don't get it, you're not creative in your interpretation, so despondent because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, it's the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be like if it were POST modern. But it is supposed to be Modern art. What is about the art itself. <br /> <br /> So, let's start this whole bit of interpretation, will we? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be used as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour relates to world divers and the construction of a huge ramp. Obviously, the driveway is symbolic of the need for self-raising to whatever standards you like, and the worlds of divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then they build on a whaling ship a crate that looks like it is in the rough form of a whale. Obviously, this is a rough element of shadow. <br /> <br /> On the ship they make whale fat in the shape of the whale and take out the fins. They replace it with a spine and later a giant. It is supposed to be the states of the movie itself. When it's fat, it's entertaining but bad for you. If it is the spine, it is the "important" parts of the movie or the spine to speak like this. Then the giant maze is the bowels of the movie, or when the movie is crazy. <br /> <br /> Arriving on separate ships, Bjork and Matthew Barney are put in strange humiliating outfits that are not even made good. OR SYMMETRIESE, one suspects they were running out of money and Barney tried to quit smoking. So, they put spots on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship of a Japanese wise man who tells them that the ship is scaring off the screen when another ship hits it. an accident or crossing, if you like. It inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to cut off each other's legs and eat them so that they can become whales and the same person. They cut. Oh, did I forget to mention that it was done in a Robbie Williams video? Then the world divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge that drop them to make a stupid Venn Diagram. Barney made it through 8th grade geometry. Or, maybe at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and did I lose Bjork's over-gold I-want-to-death score? Sometimes it is hypnotic, but in others you just want to kill her. <br /> <br /> Art film is one thing, but if you just throw all sorts of symbolism in the hope of getting a reaction from people. , it becomes a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the line between a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often made surreal bits of nonsense, but were more coherent and / or entertaining than this piece of garbage. Un Chien Andalou had the mind to suppress as much symbolism as it could in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, can I recommend it? Only if you keep dull HOW art films with lots of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
