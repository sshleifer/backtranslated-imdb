I can't be a critic, but here's what I think of this movie. Well, just watch the movie on cinemax and first I just have to say how much I hate the storyline I mean, come on what scares a snowman next to small children, secondly, it's pretty greedy, but I'm sure the movie is so low they probably used ketchup, so MY CRITICAL VOTE is BOMB !!! try and the sequel will suck twice as much.
