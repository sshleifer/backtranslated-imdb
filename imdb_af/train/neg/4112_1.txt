I think if they made any money, make a complete turd like this one. The I must come into the film industry. I wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and once made a better script. Watch as the man walks through the tunnel, they use the same 30 feet from the tunnel over and over and over and over and never change the location of the stupid HANGING light. <br /> <br /> I think as the THRILL of the director of this GEM of a FILIE, I think I will fight with him and start pushing on his LOAFERS. <br /> <br /> I think I have to bend now
