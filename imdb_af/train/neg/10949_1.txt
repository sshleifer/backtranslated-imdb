I'm going to the theater to be entertained. There is absolutely nothing entertainment about this movie. From start to finish, there is no break from the gray, grinding reality of this woman's life. It is one-way, with no change of mood. I just stayed to the end because I was convinced that things should get better. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by the numerous sounds called around the cinema when the film came to an end. Honestly depicting social deprivation is not a crime, but bored your hearing to groan is not the way to win the public's sympathy. A horrible movie.
