I might give 6 or 7 to this propaganda movie because it shows when and how a propaganda movie is successful. If there are people who see this piece and think that "Well, then the Jews must have done something that is being treated as they were treated in WW2." Then the film is made very clever to hide why and how and how it is good. and false observations on how one lives. What more could a propaganda film aim for? For example, the part in which an American movie about the Rothschild family is included is being used very sharply here. The question why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one calls the system of taxation within that particular social strata. <br /> <br /> Also, the level of excitement (or level of aversion) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie fits the purpose and must of propaganda. The audience will leave in joy and gratitude in the time that comes up. Well done. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The movie is a kind of history today, so it doesn't have to be much about it. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic decline, a cautious viewer may find relevance to contemporary cultural hatred, violence, disruption and the problems of integration. Overall, fine waste.
