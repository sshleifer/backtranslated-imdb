When I first picked up this movie, I was intrigued by the basic idea and wanted to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and love it if it is successfully merged with live action recordings. The animation in this movie, however, was about everything I enjoyed. Although it has to be said that the actors' performances were excellent. The visual appearance - including the animation - has given a marvelous budding air. However, it was the quality of discomfort that was lost among the remaining images, both visually and in writing, that you were practically hammered over. Most annoying about this was the relative lack of interest in the plot. It seemed as if the plot had been cleaned at irregular intervals, resulting in a stuttering effect that largely broke down the flow. The voice remains of Felisberto - especially the one at the end - felt a lot like a desperate attempt to fill gaping holes in the plot that were ignored in favor of his problems like the whole ant thing (and even that wasn't properly addressed ). I'm afraid the whole piece, as a 'first attempt', has come to its best, by a teenager who spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from seasoned filmmakers.
