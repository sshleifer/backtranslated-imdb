After watching it on the MST3K episode, I wonder how many movies this movie is borrowing. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes there are in the plot. As well as the fact that, although there is no gas available, there are plenty of abandoned gas stations, and the stations are close enough to keep an F1 car running throughout the country.
