I wasn't sure how to judge this movie, as it was so bad it was really funny. I am not a Gackt fan, although he is talented, despite the strange pseudonym that looks like a cat that accumulates a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on topic here people. This movie is ridiculous. It's so stupid and stupid, it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has virtually no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. This way, this movie reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with too many ideas that didn't have enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were laughing. Quickly edited, almost difficult to understand, with choreography that is so bad. Although Hyde was very stylish during the action scenes, but this film's only salvation. I'm a bastard for good action flicks, but the action was terribly done. Although the last shooting was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie. <br /> <br /> Jumping between genres isn't a good thing. It wants to be a drama, an action movie or a horror or a romance. What the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review makes you angry, why? Is this because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Don't fool yourself, this movie is bad.
