Well, let me start by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who has read the other comments. It is said, MY G-D, THIS MOVIE WAS TAKEN! I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they did of course and were still worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman was probably emerging at some point in this movie, but dropped because of the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie was made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we find that has zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, somebody else just got there. Quiet hill? No, too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room to just be stupid. Hey, did Sega not have a game where people run to shoot zombies? They're out of the platform biz, we can get it for pennies! "<br /> <br /> Basically, they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even to shoot the fight as if the Characters were actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and biggest problem is that the original game was terrible, I mean, <br /> <br /> bad-movie-merchandising-made-in-a-worse-game-in-two-week-and-then- Shipped d-out-and-bought-by-morons and their-parents-for-Christmas horrid, the graphics were boring, the samples were boring and the levels were boring, the interface was boring, the CASE was boring In other words, it was a boring game, and it was the ARCADE version, the home version was even worse, with the home version not even getting the shotgun in your hand, getting bored with this sensible game! But I'm going out. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they've gone so far as to actually make intersexual screens out of the real game during battle scenes. not had enough confidence in the effects to indicate that a real fight is taking place? Not to mention that every battle is shot from the perspective of a video game, which can explain the boring use of Matrix style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first person shooter (the player continues from the POV of the character). Perhaps that is why they sit in the game graphics to let you know they are playing the game ... Right, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing this ONLY experience remotely pleasant. was the fact that everyone in the theater got out of the movie aloud, so my sudden pace of hysterical laughter and general disbelief was considered commonplace and did not kick me out. <br /> <br /> To sum up, DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE! Don't even rent it out if it comes to video within a few days. Ends. Just run.
