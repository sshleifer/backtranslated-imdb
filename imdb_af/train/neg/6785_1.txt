> you are warned this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad I doubt I can write enough lines. good direction the shots were well thought out. The actors were very good especially Richard Pryor, I would like to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classic. Dudley More god blessing he could have done better. John Ritter would have liked to see more of him. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to writer failure. Perhaps the producer could pull the plug when he saw what he had created. It's just so bad that so much money goes into this kettle, with a little change here and there it will be determined in my opinion. They must have paid the authors' standard rates. To produce a visit.
