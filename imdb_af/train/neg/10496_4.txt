Gday Mates! Croc Hunter watched the movie. It was good, but the show looked more real. it just looked like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with harder lines and more characters. A few things: Steve describes snakes like a neck. yeeeowch! for reality you know what hurts. And can't they jump high? Hes, they stab them at the tail and stuff. There were two big shots in this movie. when Terry finds that baby joey is going like "We have to cherish them, like a baby." Woah! I thought she was going up and breastfeeding that child. this would have made it PG-13. Terry on Terry, introduced anyone to the movie and much of the show Terry's knowledge about ritual couples. she knows her sex. film takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog, Sui, actually has a purpose in this movie. although a small one proves useless against the dynamic hottie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone else sees it, try to agree with the fact that the country's bumpkin lady with the herd of dogs is right in the shotgun. he ate her sheep !! I'll be angry too!
