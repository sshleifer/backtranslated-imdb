I comment on this miniseries from the perspective of someone reading the novel first. And from that perspective, I can honestly say that while it's enjoyable, I can see why it hasn't been re-broadcast recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terribly overlooked. The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) played Natalie Jastrow, supposedly about January 26. Michael-Michael Vincent, 39, played Byron Henry, who was about 22. The other Henry children and Pamela Tudsbury were also played by actors too old for characters who had to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the plays were absolutely horrible. Ali McGraw made almost this mini unshakable. I saw more convincing performances in high school games. <br /> <br /> 3) Directing was poor. To be honest with Ali McGraw was the bad acting and character development probably directed. The depiction of Hitler was very exaggerated. His character challenged and behaved more like a cartoon abuse than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are done so stereotypically (Berel Jastrow). They don't get the depth of character that Wouk created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very dated. The hokey music, the pretentious narrative (it sounded like a junior high school history movie), and the whole primary soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comic. Too often Byron and Natalie are bought and looked like they were in 1979 rather than 1939. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees it without reading the novel first will probably not put it through. because it will come off more than the late seventies / early 80s, "take myself too seriously", prime soap drama, rather than the television version of what is definitely a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of Older Movies and the like are sometimes done poorly, but this is probably a case where a creative and inspired director can make a very beautiful, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I never see it happen, as a remake should be just as long (15 hours) or longer to do it. With the short attention span of most American audiences, it won't fly.
