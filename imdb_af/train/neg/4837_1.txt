I went to see this movie, just to see what all the hype is about, and I was so disappointed with how it got 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb to this day. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the happiest director ever to win the best photo and best Oscar for this kind of a really bad movie and I wonder why? Did the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb-disposal-man storyline mean anything to someone I failed? Why did I still get the mental image that this movie was a remake of an old, bad, Western movie about a cowboy who 'infected brave acts' in the Wild Wild West with an evil 'Red Indian' this is set in a different background this time around? Was it given to the Oscars because the director was old by James Cameron, and made it a nice (scary) story for day-to-day TV shows to renovate? Or was it a kind of Emperor's Clothes syndrome - where most people realize it was messy, but couldn't say so because others didn't hear it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what was that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing in high-resolution super-slow mo as if conveying a "deep message" or something? Something in the lines of 'EOD guys suddenly makes good snipers and they'll get the dirty terrorists all the time'? Was it just me who felt that there were so many bits and pieces of it in the movie without a clear reason? And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing it? <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your money on tickets. Wait for them to run on TV in a few years. You're not going to miss much.
