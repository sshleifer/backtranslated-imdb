A Broker will be a writer and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) is forced to live in a self-storage facility led by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman). They are believed to be the ceremony that terrorists terrorize the city, the "Costume killer" (so called because he dressed his drugs after injecting his victims with Windex). They convinced him that his life story would make a good movie and gather a group of desperate wannabe filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of filmmaking can be murdered. <br /> <br /> There is more to this movie, but unfortunately it was left in the room of the working room and it turns out (rumors are that the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do good work and earn better), as it has an exceptional black comedy, but only rises to mediocre cute. <br /> <br /> If you're a Ron Perlman fan, it's absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comic timing is excellent and he has the chance to make some wonderful impressions (he didn't talk when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed intervention when he came to Jerry Lewis mode) . He's just having fun watching this one. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a two-stage (but central) role.
