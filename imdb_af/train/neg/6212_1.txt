It was my thought that movies needed plots, or in other ways not to give you the story line or anything that went on. This movie showed me that you don't really have to have something like that. <br /> <br /> I could just sum it up. But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was beautiful. not compelling in the slightest. The way the characters speak in the movie makes you think it should have happened in a few days, but there is no time and I am pretty sure it happens in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to entertain yourself, buy a liter of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing. It will be a much better use of your time. Time you will never return. Jurassic Park 3 is better off than this movie.
