There is one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to be so blunt, but that's the truth. Too bad she didn't do a nude. That would at least make this mess tolerant. We see another chick's boobs, but she's nowhere near Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like shit! "Consequence" is the usual B movie you would expect. The story had potential. It's as if they had good ideas, but didn't know how to execute them. The cinematography is just terrible. Ugly! The direction is not inspired and the end result is a thin thriller with lame twists and excited actors. Lola Gaudini is good like the vixen in a cheap, messy way, but even she doesn't hit 'Fail' of garbage and doesn't waste funny, just old stinking garbage.
