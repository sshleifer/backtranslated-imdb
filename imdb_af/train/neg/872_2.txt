First, I expected "Caged Heat" to be the same as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, was I wrong! In no way is this movie 70's exploitation, "chix in chains", or "women in prison". Certainly, the plot is made up of a lot of women in prison, who carry street clothes (pretty comical), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There is no strong rivalry, no one tries to seduce the officer or doctor to try to escape, and no prisoners make it. There are 2 shower scenes, which I suspect are just recycled footage, but no fights break out. No one is being seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, impatient and flat characters, are some prisoners escaping, actually returning to jail to "free" their fellow prisoners? <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie had just ended with the escapes coming down in the sunset ... as opposed to keeping this mess up! <br /> <br /> I feel fraud.
