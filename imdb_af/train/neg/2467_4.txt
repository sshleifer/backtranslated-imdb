This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me as well as a 9/10 rating. Here's why: As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and scares are considered, this movie will carry you. It's basically a family drama that is similar to what you want to see on the lifetime channel, but rather in a horror universe. The story and formula are centuries old, read hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you'll have as melodramatic as a beautiful thought, going out on cheese. This is the 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic synopsis and idea is fairly original and over-the-top. It's literally something you and your friends are joking about when you're half-drunk. . . but that joke actually has a theater release. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason it isn't perfect is because they could take it even further, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but as with most comedies, it wasn't that funny. I watched my mom and my sister with me and the jokes we made about it were funny than the jokes written. There were moments of absolute genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas. I just can't say it was perfect, or even close, due to the lack of originality on the plot. <br /> <br /> A GREAT family movie. A great movie to watch with a lot of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone. . . but if you see it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this kind of movie funny and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
