OK now, let's see. What was funny in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people falling in the water, foolish boat accidents and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they turned the accent part to the maximum, not good. A lot of people fall into the water for uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, look. Funny commentary between the two teams, they tried, but failed. There are also too many personalities that they follow in this movie. This movie should be about what happens on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that there is too much between the funny parts and the sponsors of the movie to the maximum. Not good. All in all, I give it four out of ten because it contains some funny parts.
