There was a genius played by Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was beaten. His rhymes were corny. These lines were badly stupid about his stupid dad, bad actresses, bad decisive, bad special effects what's next? This movie sucks Prolly not made $ 20, he lives in a treehouse. A lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... Yes, you get it, a stupid rhyme that can not do, in a silly movie with horrible special effects. Oh, and it confuses like hell. I'm not even going any further. Let's just say, it belongs to the category "it's so bad, it's funny". Keep it with your friends once and get a good laugh. But don't expect anything spectacular.
