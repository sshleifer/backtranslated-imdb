I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz around it. Well, I can't imagine anyone likes this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> Obviously anyone who made this movie doesn't know a horror thing. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action movie (guns and criminals) and horror (living bird scarecrows). When the criminals are killed one by one by the picky scarecrows, the two genres automatically cancel each other because they are criminals first and who care about criminals, and secondly because they are stupid drugs! To have zombie scarecrows go to their work here only. Where's the horror in it? I wanted the criminals to die terrible, painful deaths. <br /> <br /> But the story is so badly built that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if they handle well, never has gels. We were simply left with a lot of super dense criminals and a lot of scarecrows, who were "alive" for whatever reason the filmmakers thought. To make matters worse, the fact that the movies are frightening (TV like) and worse offending everyone, whole groups of the dialogue are being told to the Certification Bodies, and we are constantly hearing relentless dialogue about disconnected images as if we were looking some kind of radio show. This part was really BAD. The director had to be shot in the spot to get such a stupid idea! I can't tell you how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, the criminals in SCARECROS are incredibly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly pops up, fills and fills with money and straw (yep, straw) in his large open wound, the other asks: "What drug is he up to?" after they shot shooting bats in him, was unable to kill him (he was made "scary" by the scarecrow. Don't ask ...). Get a freaking clue, morons. I've never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there's the girl. I wish one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she had a pain in the buttocks. If she found out that her father was crucified at a crossbeam, she blames the criminals in an embarrassment (bad scene), although the criminals couldn't do it. What a dim white she was! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very poor movie. They are not scary. There is nothing explained about them. They are just a plot device in this plot device filled movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, who filmed a scarecrow's face for 30 seconds without ceasing, evokes nothing but sheer boredom. And that scene with the talking head in the fridge. Thank you for laughing. <br /> <br /> All in all, it had to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and I saw a lot of movies today!) Between the equally sad SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS, I'd rather watch SILO KILLER again . Yes, SCARECROWS is so bad.
