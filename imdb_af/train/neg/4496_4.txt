This movie is a circular festival of bad acting and poor set design, as well as tough lines and a lame plot. But it's so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The basic plot is a group of scientists of the future journey back in time to capture their evil coworker who aims to destroy them all. They came to him in the year 1146. The 'futuristic' scientist of the year 2033 scientists is an eight-room school room with a lot of 'futuristic' buttons and a lawn-like magazine. The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which is not difficult to understand, as the lines are usually earthquakes such as "I have double-checked double!" He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they give you the whole idea of ​​the movie in the first five minutes, and continue with a quick fire until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop traveling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comical mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could get, they used. I think chain posts were not on the budget, because the guys all have towed shirts that decorate as armor. The battle scenes are laughing, with men throwing themselves on the cardboard swords with surrender and dying in death throwing with a throat. It sounds really awful, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The lines alone are enough to keep you fit and everything goes together to create a fantastic B-movie. If you're a connoisseur, I'll suggest you. And once you have read the review, read Unknown Movies. I like to hear them, show all the funny, really horrible bits in the movie.
