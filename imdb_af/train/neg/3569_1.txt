Wow! Just a movie that is ridiculously horrible can inspire the similar "Showgirls". I mean where to start? The inevitable terrible theme song? Pia Zadora's non-expressions throughout the movie? The fact that, despite being in Los Angeles, is also the "land of the casting bank" is every single man (and woman!) Sleeping with Pia Zadora, with any confrontational means needed? Or what about the fact that every person in the movie is completely impersonal because they are either mentally stupid (Pia) or obviously despicable slum ball (all)? And since this movie was written by real "scriptwriters (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film industry (who will admire and kiss hell for a Writer?) <br /> <br /> But that's (unintentionally) funny as hell though. The "interruptions" scene alone will giggle you, and after you have seen the climate, "I'm not the only one to make her way to the top" "Awards" (everything done in The ordinary merchant cellar acting level that we expect from such quality jobs as Pia, I hope our dear Pia has actually reused the speech when she won her Golden Globe, which is fit and it will completely make my day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a fan of a bad, tashy camp, this otherwise tough movie gives a try.
