I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I'm looking forward. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, a father and daughter follow a female vampire who is lucky in their journey. Then we run Santa Claus (or the general, as he likes to be called here) about random zombies. Did I mention that there was a zombie outbreak? The dead come back to life, but no one seems to worry. We have construction-worker-zombies, soldier-zombies and even St.Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently, Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who changed into a vampire. Oh, wait there are no vampires, the girl is in a thin asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and I love zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to make the juices flow. When will we see vampires fighting zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here comes the St.Trinian zombies. Chain saw time !! More lesbian sex then kills the zombies and eats the vampires. I think the zombies won or did they do it? Plot? Who needs a plot if you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
