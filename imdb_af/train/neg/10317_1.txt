Until this new season I was a big 'Little Mosque' fan. However, the new season made it absolutely. <br /> <br /> The new Christian minister destroyed the whole intent of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. The new minister ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Christian or a Muslim, but loved seeing the show and seeing the companionship between Amar and the Honor. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and do it. It is no longer worth looking at. <br /> <br /> It may still be saved, but many changes will have to be made. <br /> <br /> Return the old format.
