Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, the "Dreamer" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize" that when sprayed on dog mist, the poo disappears into the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so I could spray it on this stinker of a movie and also make it disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the past 12 months (the honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it gets the honor of a close second. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, nothing. A true "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> A 0.2 out of 10 !!
