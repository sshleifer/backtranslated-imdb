By 1941, Columbia was a full-fledged studio and could produce a movie with the same technical Polish as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing to say about "Adam Had Four Sons", an empty soap opera with almost final performances by Ingrid Bergman (for the first time in an American movie) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchman (it was the era in which Hollywood thought one strange accent was as good as another), who was appointed as governor to Baxter's four sons and remains (with one interruption caused by the stock market accident from 1907) to the boys grown men serving in the First World War. Just about everyone in the movie is so good, good, it's a relief when Susan Hayward comes as the rogue in the middle of the road? she's about the only viewable person in the movie, although she can clearly channel Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; It is also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles ?? but the scripture remains saccharin and the end is completely ridiculous. No wonder Bergman set up the similar "The Valley of Decision" four years later.
