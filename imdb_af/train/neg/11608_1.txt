If this man can make a movie, then I'm sure hell can also make one. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I'll add more naked women. This movie had nothing. I think cheeses B-class horror movies are only hired because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I don't want to let my viewers drop. <br /> <br /> 2) I will stop making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out that this is just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And since the movie was just an hour long, the dream-to-movie length ratio was pretty high. And if I decide to do a dream series, I'll make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who's sleeping in pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I will not get rid of any movies like Star Wars or the Matrix, because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask disdain for big budget Hollywood movies add satirical references to them in mines. <br /> <br /> 4 And finally, I won't mix modern technology with the dead. I mean, a palm pilot can be just as scary. At least they turned it into an evil rolly-poly sample before the screen blew or something. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for the top quality in your next horror production, count on me: the will-b movie director extraordinary.
