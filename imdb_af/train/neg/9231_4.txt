I went to this movie and thought it would be the next clerks, but dropped me off. The humor was poor and the characters pretty flat. It is not to say that it was all bad. The idea of ​​the dating service in the grocery store looked like a fertile material, but the director focused on the cliche'd "save the Mom-and-Pop store of the evil corporation man". I felt as if he had just clung to the dating service plot, would he come up with a much more memorable movie. Now, to do the film justice, I come from the Rochester area and love the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (of Clerks) tribute here gave props to his hometown. Webster, NY is to checkout what is Red Bank, NJ to Clerks. The director threw at Nick Tahou's date wisely. Trust me, as far as what to do in Rochester, a garbage can is at the top of the list. I was fortunate to see this movie at the Little in Rochester, so everyone knew when the odes came up to the town and appreciated them.
