Typically terrifying trash by director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter (Teagan) commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and run the escaped alien offender Ross Hagen. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of stubborn hammy college kids led by Richard Wiley who ran with Hagen with his RV on a camping tour. Soon, the cyborg will move away with her arm laser that burns an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry or Count Yorga-Vampire celebrity) and prove that no one will stand to get the hidden shelter, whose collar is a shell device which weakens his body. The law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnam warrior, with too many weapons in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was deliberately horrified, and it contains the owners of "rancid cinema". effects, acting and prospect. At least, the movie has PJ Soles for some eye candy .. even in '89, she was quite smokin '. This laser gun is probably funny. It may burn some homes, but when the Cyborg shoots at law, it barely lets a mark on the spot.
