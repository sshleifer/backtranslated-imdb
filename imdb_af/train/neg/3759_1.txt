Oh, where to start. The cinematography was wonderful. When the movie first started because of the initial landscape screens, I thought I was in a good movie. Then the cgi showed Bigfoot. It looked like a cartoon of the Lion King and King Kong's love child. This completely removed the credibility of the character. Now I knew there wasn't a Bigfoot walking around behind the bush. no apparent reason, but a cheesy cgi cartoon. From then on the whole movie was shot for me. The money they swung into the toilet for the cgi they could spend on a costume like roger Patterson. She was the best Bigfoot costume ever. No one could fit his own. I am a loudfooted Bigfoot movie fan and I have been warned about this movie, but my compulsion led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed as previous reviews warned me. I know after reading this review, you will still say, "I need to watch Sasquatch hunters, Sasquatch hunters must watch." Then you'll say why I was wasting my good, hard earned money on such an eerie bad boring movie!
