This movie represents the times it made in as much as the original, I think. It's really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point' is the original, so ironic. I'm sure it wasn't so meant, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. The REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the end of an era, which ended almost in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this repetition, all the countercultural elements have been stripped away, and more computerized in an effort to reach a larger audience, presumably. "Sanitized for your Protection" <br /> <br /> The insertion of the American Indian scenes was free and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for the trip was deduction by addition. I am glad I looked at it, it appreciated the original so much more. The original is a cult classic and golden. This remake is terrible.
