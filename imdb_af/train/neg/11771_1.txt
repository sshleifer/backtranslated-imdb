This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, but for reasons that are best left for the powers it is. Much seems to have been made of the fact that it is the first Thai language film made with Thai actors and crew, but directed by a Westerner. Don't worry about being honest, because this movie is boring, boring and boring. Why hint at something, why sneak an idea into mystery, why subtly call a feeling when you can hammer the point home with horrible stem remains, obvious shots and tops. Nothing is left to the imagination. Spurrier cleaves the endless clich√©s. No hinting, no guess, it's all on the screen, we shouldn't use our imagination. Wonder when the 'scary' comes a little? No, you won't, because the soundtrack will become more and more intimidating, coming to a crescendo of evil. Hell, I make words to describe how bad it is. Wondering if the alleged demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes it really bites at its crotch, and there is blood everywhere. It's a strange, uncomfortable movie for several reasons. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the jolts are marked and clear. It may be an attack on the seed of Thailand, but the director has a sobbing, filthy style when it comes to the fact that he shows scarce teens. Perhaps he threw himself as the virgin westerner who had planted the seeds of doubt into my head. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Uninspired, careless, repetitive, hacked - all candidates for the best description, but boring looks most appropriate and honest. It has been seen before, probably better, often with more thoughts, rarely with less imagination or flame. Sorry. Thumbs down on each count. Actually dire.
