The dialogue was pretty scary. The plot isn't really everything that inspires beyond the obvious twist it offers. Not visually amazing. Actually visually annoying at times. Definitely one of those movies will be easier to finish if you hold one finger on the fast forward button. If you could see it for free, there are absolutely no other options open and you really see the little poltergeist lady denounced. Well, maybe I would recommend it, but not someone else I could think of at the moment.
