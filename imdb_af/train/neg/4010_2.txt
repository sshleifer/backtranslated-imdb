When I first watched the show, the first few episodes looked promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and Sookie offered herself as an independent woman. However, the performance has been subtracted from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities. At episode 5, Bill's folded eyebrows are so low that his face is just a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events are around her and she only responds to how pleasant it is to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep too early in the show. The way they crushed each other was something that hurt me and could easily be searched for a little more. As soon as Sookie loses it, she stumbles around like a total sentence, just to Bill's libido and the size of his attachment. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and good, he just becomes silly. His actions are never really explained, except he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for one another is never buried if there is any love. So far, it looks like it's just sex that is at the heart of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually gender but come on. Every five seconds I see a little humping going on. This was not so much a surprise as HBO is always trying to pass a soft core porno as a decent TV show. Bill coming out of the dirt and just getting on with Sookie, with no reason so ever? I laughed so hard, I almost carried myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never leave anything. All the events that happen are usually inexplicable. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say I'm doing is the little characters. Tara and her drunk mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Minus the gender and the main characters will be worth the show.
