I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show is also poorly produced and written. The acting is not much more than the lower production values, but I feel that an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In line with this idea, I feel it is important to point out that one actor has gone up well and has been consistently past this camping to tasteless production to become a respected and reasonably talented artist. I refer to Laura Harris, a Canadian born actor who etched her way through very poorly produced performances and movies to find a place on the HBO hit "Dead Like Me", where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and managing her credit, she handles this role effectively. I remember having a typical youthful loved one. on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley, but a gentle but intelligent 7th degree. I felt as if someone could make it from this series, it would probably be Laura Harris, and wherever of her nature, she performed in the acting. field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as the unique Nordic blonde allure. If you ever get the opportunity to see this series, I recommend that you email something to look at wards such as the 'Godfather' or 'Beaches', to remind yourself that there is still really true production integrity and value out there and that this series is just a low budget reminder of what Laura Harris can say about her time at the show and I bet she would quote a young defense word by saying, "This is a start!"
