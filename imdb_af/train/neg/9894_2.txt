I missed the beginning of this movie, which might be why I didn't like it that much. On the other hand, I've been studying the fall of the Roman Republic for years, so I know the story. Then again, this could also be the reason why I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they have tried to correct it, in which case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that they are sometimes very big to be historically accurate and eventually become confusing. Like throwing Antonius's marriage with Octavia and then moving two scenes later. Why does it even bring up if it doesn't serve the plot and Octavia is never even seen? And like to call Antony in his real name (Marcus Antony) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> While historical inaccuracies were set aside, the movie could still be an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading woman. There is no dignity in her. She is hysterical, dramatic and completely uncontrolled over herself. Instead of being a clever and composed queen, Cleopatra becomes a hysterical teen with a poor PMS case. 95% of them come from the poor, but 5% are also from poor writing. Too many silly dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you didn't look at Antony and Cleopatra, you watched Dawson's Creek immature versions of Dawson and Joey. <br /> <br /> Looking at something over this period, look ... anything except this.
