I was unsure whether Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the film region "Malibu Express." With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. The plot written by Sidaris, which was thankfully conveyed by the Academy, is a complex script with many unhealthy twists and turns. The main characters work for a sexually based radio station known as KSXY. Slim, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they confront their long-time nemesis Kane, trying to steal one of Russia's most popular diamonds. A well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by throwing helps to ensure this movie as a cult classic. The film is complemented by critics and the cashier's office. This film will be appreciated in the coming year. It now suffers from the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but will undoubtedly be recognized in the future. I'm disappointed. No critical circles acknowledged Andy Sidaris' branding. The costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this beautiful piece of film. It can do you the best to ignore and go out of the bad 3 rating on this movie and rent it yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the ruined Runaway Bride, and the action is better or equal to the movie masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
