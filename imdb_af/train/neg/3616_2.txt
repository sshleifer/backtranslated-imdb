Watching just the cover of this movie is cool. DO NOT. The movie itself slept me. It was slow, with minimal violence and poor use of tension. The play was the lower feed material and the plot, while it would have been cool for another movie, was poorly displayed. They even kill the only similar character in the whole movie! I give it a 2 out of 10, because the only thing that was good was the plot at the end. Other than that, you might want to save yourself from this movie waste.
