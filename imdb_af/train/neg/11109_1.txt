I'm really surprised that this movie gets such a position! For years I haven't seen such a bad movie. And it was a very bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary (almost funny) blood tones. If you didn't have hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) .. well, it's 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps. <br /> <br /> I can't tell the acting as the writing was so horrible. Click all the time. (why should I write 10 lines? I never understood.) <br /> <br /> == Here comes spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher who has kill the time in the subway. We are talking about thousands of murders and nobody gets to know. Actually, those people are just missing out. And there is the good man trying to solve the mystery (well, there's no secret to us, because we know the bad guy from the beginning) and as usual nobody believes him! What a surprise! Eventually he puts butcher clothes and fights with the killer butcher!
