I do not know who is guilty, me. Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin on the other hand does a better job - at all odds. His character is far too charming and attractive. but certainly not so greedy enough to cope with Leigh's character's cowardice. Chaplin seems confused by what cannot possibly be understood as Leigh's shame and lack of grace, but rather her orthopedic instability. There must be some credibility to his interests, but as played, it is incomprehensible. The performances do not flow. Of course, Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are wonderful despite any attempt to derail them. The supportive role is also a pleasure to watch. What a pity, the leaders don't work together because the production is nice to look at.
