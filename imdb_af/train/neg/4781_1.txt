This may be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. The authors and producers must study the German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even the Soviet-style clunky leader as god-like father figure was better done. Disappointing. The loss of faith, at the last moment regained in church, because Daddy was saved by the Hoover / God, was not bad. Unfortunately, it was rushing and not nearly melodramatic enough. A few foggy heavenly shots of the angelic Hoover in the corner of the screen, shining and nodding, would have added a lot. The best thing is Hoover just what saves the deserving family and kids who have proven their worth. Unfortunately, other poor homosexuals are portrayed as nice and even good - but the Hoover God does not help them. A better approach would be shots of those who drank to show the justice of their condition. Finally, shiny and cheerful scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the land of depression) had to be rolled out. We could then see how Hoover God not only saved this deserving family, but all the meritorious merit. Amateur at its best.
