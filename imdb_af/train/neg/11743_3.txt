I can really say nothing or just about this thing. Its characters are nice enough, it's capably manufactured and designed, and professional (except for that cute monster suit). However, it has no originality, no ideas and nothing you have not seen in Alien, Predator, Armageddon and / or abroad. It's just another formula, cookie cutters, "grim corporate drones in the deep space versus unstoppable monster" movie. Much waste of time.
