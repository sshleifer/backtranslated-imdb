Ha. Tommy is without a doubt the evil one here. I don't know why, but for some reason, small children in horror movies tend to come in like little bits. and since they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... except asylum of terror. but it is little and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway on the movie. Can't find this movie on DVD? Yes you can! All you have to do is buy the Chilling classic DVD pack! Not only do you get metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 other movies! what a bargain! pff. OK. I'm ready to advertise for these cute movies. Let's just say, this movie is not worth the $ 15 in itself. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemist scientist. Yes. Let all chemist scientists look as attractive as this old Peter plays. He tries to get up with a serum to stop the body's deterioration. the college he works to pull the plug on his project, so he tries it on himself. But because it is a horror movie, it sucks and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes almost 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To make out the movie, he gets a relationship with a woman who has a son and she was never married! scandalous! But of course, Tommy is one of the most annoying characters .... no. I'll take it back. He is the most annoying character. Much worse than the old cripple who wants to take over Pieter's work and gloss over him while in hospital. That's right, even if an old cripple, you can still be the villain. <br /> <br /> So, we see Peter start killing people randomly in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his way to get back to normal. But in the end he ends up developing a lizard. yes, i don't know ask. The end really makes no sense. And if you hope for a very good payout, you won't get it. <br /> <br /> It's not a DIFFERENT film. It's just frustrating because of the lack of good payouts. If you already own the 50 movie suit and this is your list, you are not in a snoozer, but you are not in for a good movie either. Just sit back, relax, and eat a lot of food. Because this movie won't jump you soon from your skin <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads, out of 10.
