This movie is really goofy! I saw it as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I will only recommend this movie for children under the age of 12. I didn't really care about it, but I think it answers some very good questions children need to be aware of, such as: 1) Buying money luck? 2) Should I (to my parents) lie about things I think they will not approve of? 3) Buy Money Friendships? 4) Is Money Everything? 5) Shouldn't I tell my parents if someone is trying to hurt me? Permitted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should also watch this video, to show their children that they have the lies, the potential to hurt you.
