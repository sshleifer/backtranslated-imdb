Guy is a loser. Can't get girls, build up, be picked up by stronger, more successful guys, etc. See it, see it, move on. I must say that Rob has to move over the Adam Sandler part of his life. And go out of the Adam Sandler plots. There are two funny parts in the whole movie. I couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes. I got bored. The animal is a good movie. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler movies that have the same plot. But it was too difficult to impress. The jokes are very old. So, trust me. It's not a movie that most people really could get. But some have, so I'll be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
