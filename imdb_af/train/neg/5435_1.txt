... have they bothered to make this movie? Anyone? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an upcoming movie, rent Summer of '42. This is not a summer of '42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, Sarsgaard gets more screen time, this is your first warning sign. And of course, for such a "artsy" movie, there is a lot of curse and skin overturned, just to make it look "artsy". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard structured its ordinary, uninteresting cardboard character by moments that were supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of someone with a bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is best known for her appearance and what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh must hold a grudge against her. She misrepresented a real Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard-acting style. Wow! Was it his first role after high school graduation? <br /> <br /> So, we have this strange triangle. Foster loves Miller but is with his boss / girlfriend. He can't take Miller in bed and won't take his boss in bed. So he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller, and watches them turn on. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller gets it up, a scene we are treated to. in every messy, groaning detail. Finally, just to eradicate it all, Foster & Sarsgaard gets it up, with Foster in the Miller role. Now I know how 2 guys are doing it (as if it was something I needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all, all that remains is the tragic end to one character and the retrospective views of the remaining 2. It gets me right in the pit of my stomach. No wait! It was the pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> I would like to enjoy the time that this movie has taken from my life.
