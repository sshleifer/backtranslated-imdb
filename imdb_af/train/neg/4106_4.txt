It was almost incomprehensible that this film would be a bust, but I was disappointed. After years of being an expert at Pekinpah Theater, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, bought and thought it was worth a shot. The open few credits, an iconic Pekinpah fan, have human and animal interactions, but here we have an awkward environmental noise from children playing on a school ground while a bomb is being planted. Fantastic tension. Then, when the perps, Caan and Duval, travel after their next mission, Duval dropped the bomb on Cann that his date had an STD last night, just by snooping her purse while Cann was intimate with her. The subsequent laugh is fantastic, and is clearly paying tribute to Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill, in the short-term cost of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that the movie goes flat after opening credits. Even bringing me The head of Alfredo Garcia has a stronger production value, a bold call for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as a supplementary lesson, but as soon as they finish, the Killer Elite turns off.
