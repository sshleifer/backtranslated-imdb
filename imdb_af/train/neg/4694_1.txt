I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was keen to get the coil from the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is made up of several "big-headed" drivers who have been sold out to deliver goods that are traveling across the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, but the filmmakers never buried in the complexity of them as humans. Instead, the story meanders as much as the cards in the movie are meant to guide, but never do. At most we are lost. We - the audience - end nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, ends somewhere but without direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intention to convince a group of people they see as "overlooked" and "invisible" becomes so subconscious and annoying. The problem here lies in the perspective of the directors rather than the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive truck driver assumptions forward and then change the movie just to confirm the assumptions. Overall, the story lacks tension, the movie is far too long (had to be a 15-minute sketch), the big question of "So who" is never answered and the whole movie is one piece of propaganda that is transparent. nothing to further "relieve" (as the directors demand) the outside world over big riggers.
