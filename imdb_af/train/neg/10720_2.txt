I saw this movie last weekend and it is stupid and senseless. An old curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are senselessly scared and cannot move from a slow old man. They drop their torches and snatch them, or they have to burn him. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster, aka Miss. Canfield van Let it boast to Beaver, which is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the role play just follow each other in the graves and wait for screams to respond and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl is not bad, but does not care much about the film. Where's the mummy? Actually just unleash a curse. It does not at least have a torch on Universal Mummy movies. Watch this movie if you need sleep because you will slow down.
