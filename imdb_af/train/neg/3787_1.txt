I must be that one guy in America who doesn't like this movie. I think it just wasn't my style or something, I just didn't see what was so fascinating, it was * hardly entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /> <br /> It's about a man who's got nothing, and continues to become a drug lover. Nice simple way to describe a whole movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just because a movie about mafia / drug trafficking, criminal groups aren't automatically a good movie, don't forget good stories.
