There are two points I must make clear at first. First, we all know that this year's Oscar's were really all over this year. It was the Academy's way of showing people that they were not racist and never was. They wanted to erase all preconceived ideas about themselves. Secondly, it is advisable to make comments about the show, because really, what difference will it make? But it's nice to write about it. This is the year I went through with the Oscar's! I will never look at the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" when they have to be the real winner of Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it and you agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when released receives no nominations. And as far as this year goes, well, the bad choices were all over the place! Baz Lurhmann does not get a "Best Director" nomination! Make you joke !! A beautiful thought 'is for the best makeup ???? "Training Day" is nominated ?? The movie was horrible, and it seemed that Washington didn't even turn on a show, all it showed, he knew how to use four letter words! That's why the award was won! Take the language away and I bet he almost plays himself! I like "Gosford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how can they not give it to Altman! I mean, if you just give people the award to clear any bad feelings, how about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me this year's Oscar's, but I'll live there, as long as I never have to watch another show! The highlight (and the only one) of the show was when Woody Allen had won his first appearance ever before. It will be one of the greatest moments in its history.
