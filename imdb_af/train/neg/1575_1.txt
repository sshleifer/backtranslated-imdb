This movie is so bad it hurts. The car does 30 mph when it is supposed to go 100 ... the shift lever is stuck (in Park!), The nurse who drives the phone on the shoulder for about 2 hours ... can't get any of the 2 morons take this damn cell phone? There is nothing credible in this crap. I would be ashamed to be seen in such a movie!
