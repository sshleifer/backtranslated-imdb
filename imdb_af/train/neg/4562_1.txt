I didn't feel like I was raped as I did with THE SALE CHRISTMAS, but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like Christmas, BMW hates its audience, but not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly, cannons, idiot, and the writing is terribly bad. None of the stories work. It's not the characters we loved about BATB, they are a lot of pod people. I wanted to analyze it, but after a few minutes I gave up because no one in their own mind would take this blow power seriously. What we have here is three stories. "The perfect word" is an overwhelming, thoughtful study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Foolish" only works if you can assume that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she is a James Bond locker and that Lumiere is an idiot about women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" as I would like to call it) is probably the most horrible of the bunch. Animal hates birds? From when? Don't watch this crap - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a film classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and human soul.
