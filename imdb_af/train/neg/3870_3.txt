Under the dense green slip of computer graphics, the stunning art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro shone. Oh, it's been lost. The plays of Old Edo - with the court services floating, practicing and acting in the Nakamura-za - were all exciting and engaging, and have taken you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excelled and excited, was more enriching than any of the absurdly loud noises that followed. The skill, energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, was far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over the plot and performance. What a mess! One of the best kabuki actors lives, and he gets lost in the liquor.
