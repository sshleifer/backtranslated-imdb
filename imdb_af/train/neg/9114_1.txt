Because "cruel" would be the only word to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you even start? In a spray of b * tchiness, I'm going to start with the terrible action of almost everyone in this movie. Scratch it. Almost does not belong in that sense. I can't think of one character well portrayed. Although, in all fairness, it would be impossible to portray these zero-dimensional characters successfully. Still, the girl Katherine played (whose name I deliberately didn't include - I pretend she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, just obscured by the guy Sebastian played . The story was terrible to God. It attempted to reflect the brilliance of the first, but failed in so many ways. Pretty much every part of it was useless - although I would admit the plot was pretty good, it's his surprise. And the end was at least slightly humorous. But this movie is there with the worst I saw. Don't look at it. Just don't. There is absolutely no value to look at it. None. It just takes the pleasure of the first way.
