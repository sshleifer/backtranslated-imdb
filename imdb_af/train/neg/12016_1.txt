If Bob Ludlum were to see this mini-series, he would have called out. It was a complete waste of time and money. I read the book and even though movies aren't exactly what the book might be, CBS has wasted time and money on it and it's embarrassing to say it's Ludlum's job. <br /> <br /> May the creator be. watch the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to stop these layers? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
