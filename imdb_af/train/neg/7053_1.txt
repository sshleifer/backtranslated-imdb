Okay, the promotions promised a comedy and people (few) watched it. Being the first issue of 2006 is not a bad thing, or for that year's issue, because the first and last movies mostly flop except GHAJINI and a few more /> <br /> Okay come on JAWANI DIWANI <br /> <br /> Short overview The film is about Emraan Hashmi doing his usual things. Unfortunately, this is annoying this time after repetitions. It has an annoying Hrishita Bhatt and a flop of Celina Jaitley. <br /> <br /> Cringeworthy dialogues, comedy scenes and badly treated drama and lots of loopholes. <br /> <br /> Direction is bad. Emran Hashmi is irritating here, fortunately he is now aged. But post FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and some decent work in a few more movies the actor in him took a back seat and focused directors on his kiss and female image that lost heartbreak after repetitions Hrishita and Celina are bad Mahesh is terrible
