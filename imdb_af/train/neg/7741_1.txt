Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, its thick writing, and Harrison Ford is in a compromise comedy! Here are 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and better utilize 116 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> The buddy cop movies are fun. But their true golden age was back in the 1980s and 1990s. Making one trying to mix action and comedy by Hollywood police itself is certainly a good idea, but its final outcome does not seem to be a spoof of the subgenre, but a reason to ask to have mercy on all the passing films of the same kind, while the worst of them was greater than anyway (Hollywood murder). <br /> <br /> What really happened to this entertaining formula? For a whole decade things weren't the same. You will have a friendly action after another. I will entertain you with a few titles to catch the disaster well: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004) and worst of them all (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> One of the reasons is the natural saturation after many similar films and TV shows over two decades. Add in particular the negligent trade and the dull humor. Actually, this case is completely unbearable this time. Yes, we have the characters of 2 loyal policemen who have second jobs, and the background of the sinful city, but what was new? It's not about cliché; It's about some innovations mixed with clichés where both were bad. <br /> <br /> The acting, especially of (Hartnett's) side, is terrible. This man is anything but a comedian (or actor!). His character wanted revenge for his father's death! Vengeance on yourself man, he probably died to watch your acting !!. Even the little roles have people who have nothing to do with comedy (or that's how it looks anyway!). <br /> <br /> Directing fails to give something that is slick or difficult, some have managed to be very boring (the black man in the hand is missing?); it is a rare time to be boring in what is supposed to be action / comedy! They didn't use Hollywood themselves or it was an ironic place where there was an ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even a place full of shiny or stars (comos that could give it some interesting moments) . <Br /> <br /> This is a very easy movie that is transmitted through the stars' glory, and as a Buddy cop movie that ultimately becomes one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on display ended up (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself! Guess who ?!), and a Buddy-Cop destroyer more than movie! God, don't make me, or my kids, live enough to witness (Hollywood murder? Part 2)! Finally, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted a good time, but we didn't.
