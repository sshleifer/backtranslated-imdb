80 minutes, and it feels twice as long! Short crossing is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes or so consists almost entirely of a dialogue (more of a monologue, really) of a middle-aged woman, and drunk about "men", disappointment, sex, aging and her recent breakdown, after a French teenager, she met in the cafeteria of the ship. <br /> <br /> The boring monologue continues as they go to the tax-free shop, and to a bar, after which her self-confident rant pushes him away. The "story" cannot end there, so she convinces him to listen more to her dream as she brings him to her cabin. <br /> <br /> Which little romance, sex or thing matters, anything with all this movie except bitter ranting is scarcely enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas nothing interesting happens. Yes, the end has been very well done, but it is hardly rewarding to subject yourself to changing your living room in a virtual therapeutic session with a narcissistic defendant. <br /> <br /> Of course, some like it. I can be wrong.
