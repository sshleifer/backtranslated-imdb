This version is probably available at your local dollar store on DVD. The pressure is not good, nor the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes to save, you will be worth your money. Anna Neagle is very vapid as Nanette. Whatever her charm may have been in the day, is not clear in this movie. A large number of good character characters appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is remarkably short of their talents. Still, it is interesting to see how such advanced artists make the most of the poor writing. The music numbers (there are actually only two) are pretty terrible. It was clear that the studio was not forced to pay cash on the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can be $ 1.00. It's so much worth saying that you've seen it.
