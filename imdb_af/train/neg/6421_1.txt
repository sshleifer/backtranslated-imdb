I'm surprised by some of the reviews of this movie. The only place that tells the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is extremely lazy. It's not scary either. People out there who think that because it's star Sarah Michelle Geller, it's somehow like The Grudge should forget it. This movie is more like Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and slow than that. I was very disappointed with this movie. It didn't scare me or interest me either. Let's say this, this type of plot jumped to death at this stage. the dead are trying to contact life - Dragonfly, Wat Lies Onder, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only one who has original horror movies today is writing the Japanese and the Koreans. The movies that come out of Hollywood are like cynical exercises in making money without mere respect for the viewer. They are just cut out
