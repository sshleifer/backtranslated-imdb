Richard Tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything. He doesn't like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents can happen to him. So one day he was riding his bike and because it was raining, he decided to wait in the library until it stopped raining. In it the whole story takes place. He is experiencing all sorts of staff and in the end he is no longer afraid. But the whole story is incredible and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin couldn't make the story better than it was.
