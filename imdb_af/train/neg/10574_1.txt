With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than Season One. I can't imagine what they think. As a fan of horror, a lot of gore and senseless chaos can endure, but this series gets worse with every outing. I can't imagine how daunting it should be for the actors and the crew to work every day and struggle to cut out such crap. STORY! Is it too much to ask? CHARACTER! How can we get the fate of someone in this story? If we are not engaged, who cares whether they are being cut down or what? Almost every episode ends with ceaseless bloodshed, going for a brutal shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON why we were subjected to an hour of blood loss. Even Dante's efforts this season failed sexist violence and came to a senseless conclusion. Ironically, the production values ​​and performances tend to speed up quickly, while the content is completely crazy. I greatly hope for Exec Producer's Garris's VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS, but we'll see.
