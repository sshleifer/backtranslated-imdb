MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, MAKE MY NEWS THIS MOVIE! What drugs are you people up for! It could be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad journey all the time. I need to call a therapist to help me with the trauma of this epic disaster. From start to finish glow ropes are an unholy masterpiece of satanic theater. When I thought about watching this movie with my Jewish best friend and family, we thought, "Oh, it might be funny! It'll probably be bad, but still a little funny." How wrong we were, we were not prepared for how terrible this movie could be. All my friends acted for lobotomies as soon as the film was over. One of my friends tried to hang himself with his belt while another tried to split his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I had watched the video of The Ring, and so the pain and suffering will only be over in seven short days. For anyone who wants to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! You may think you're a kind of "tough man" by renting it, but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and blow you.
