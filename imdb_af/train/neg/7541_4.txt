great mystery, but the movie goes from there. The start is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter are burned alive before a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized about this and sees dolls. A mysterious letter emerges from an old friend who asks for help to find her missing daughter. So Ed traveled to an island municipality of mainly women. They do not like outsiders. Many filler was shown to Ed to look at the town for the girl. It made the movie too long. It eventually gets a little better to the end when we learn about the mad rituals that the woman does and ultimately the sinister plan in the store for Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL THINK: I'll beat it over.
