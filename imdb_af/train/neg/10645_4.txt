I have never seen a Tarzan movie, so when I saw it on the television, I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not how I thought Tarzan would look. And if I didn't miss it while making a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional devastating scream. Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - jumping from the vine to the vine. <br /> <br /> Oh, so much for expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - the monkey Cheeta was there. There was a guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but nothing good at all. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to launch Tarzan: 4/10
