One would think that a film about a young person who is going to come with his budding homosexuality is nothing but dull. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a drug for insomnia, as it is about ten times as strong as any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the movie maker * sees a movie, but has become lazy and has decided to run a series of random (and random BORING) images and go into scenes nowhere, throwing some real scenes in real acting, pretending that good lighting is important in the film processing process, and turning it under the banner of an arthouse movie. This is exactly the kind of crappy product that makes it easy for many traditional filmmakers to poo the indie film movement, and which makes it easier for the general public to embrace indie films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in movies covering this topic, you will be much better tuned to some of the great short films available on Logo's website or rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long-winded drink.
