It's just a victim of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the storyline in the book. And there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the scriptwriter even saw the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) gets out of jail at the start of the original. Here, Carlito leaves with his wife in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail of Lorain, Ohio? In this installment she is not mentioned, and Carlito comes down with and presumably goes to marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Where is Kleinfeld too? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this movie. He was back in Pachanga in the Pacino days. Now he is Nacho Reyes, a killer of Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It was a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb's character come from? I also think this movie really flashes about the racial tension in Harlem that Torres writes about. And the gang doesn't get the treatment they did in the book. They are also wiped out in this movie. But magic is the Pleasant Avenue forest around the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book told a wonderful story. This movie could have told a wonderful story. It's just a big disappointment. Read the book. It's a better use of your time.
