"The return of Chandu" is remarkable, if you can say so, to Bela Lugosi's decisive hero rather than the villain. Why he even got the girl. <br /> <br /> The story as such involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the lovely Maria Alba) and using her as a sacrifice of the revival of their old leader who looks just like Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to destroy the villains. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive inventory. Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the huge doors used to keep Kong in bay in various scenes. The acting is for the most part terrible. For example, the actor who plays the high priest (I believe Lucien Prival), uses the verdict that had been made in the early talks. The less said about the other, the better. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi participated in independent quickies at this stage of his career, as he was still a bankable star at Universal. Maybe it was because he had to play the hero and get the girl, who knows. As his career turned down in the late 1930s, this kind of price would be the norm for Lugosi, rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
