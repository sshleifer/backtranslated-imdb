This movie is a joke and Quinton must be ashamed of himself and try to overtake it as a Modesty Blaise movie. If you struggle to sleep it means renting this movie. The stick figure they call an actress supposed to be Modesty Blaise must be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe she can be used as a hat in the background of a real movie. Seventy-five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button. If you see this movie if you can call it, it will come your way. I can't help but think what 3rd world country can use the money wasted from this crap. this movie is boring the actors are boring wastage of color a waste air their breath If you want to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one they made in the 60's, maybe what the director has to do.
