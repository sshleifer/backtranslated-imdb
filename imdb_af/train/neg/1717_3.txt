Here we have 2 misunderstood children who have never had a chance of a cruel, poverty-ripening existence. Gad! According to this crap, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the Missouri, taught to be a psychopathic killer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt anyone. He just wanted things without much energy. to get them. Poorly acting, poorly-filmed, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, gore that looks more like grape jelly than the right thing. Avoid these bilge water. Thumbs off. -5 stars.
