This production has absolutely no storyline. The acting is embarrassing. Promising Dutch television, Sophie Hilbrand, should not add this movie to her CV. Her play is far from impeccable and personally I think she has crossed the boundary of professional decency; regarding the way she exposes herself in this movie. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands (as most movies do). Don't bother watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassment for Hilbrand, who was better off with her on the screen.
