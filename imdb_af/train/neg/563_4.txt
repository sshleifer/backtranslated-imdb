Should every good story be "enhanced" with added Corny Broadway music? Apparently, those who do not get their own plots can think that classic literature is just there for looting. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because it is definitely true that Dickens often wrote things that left you, and that was a good example of this ... Of course, take this serious story and add nauseuse music and camp it up with every character of orphans refusing to hug bobbies and suddenly it's exciting? Oh no. Get me a sink. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I can compare to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a movie that could be a drama version proud, but then they should have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike my fair lady, those who sing here can actually do it and they graciously liberated us from the voice of Oliver Reed (forgive me if I miss it, it's a while). My biggest complaint I am "I said. Why do everyone, except the really shameless, give everyone silly songs in a perfect story? Rare is done with good effect. Generally, it ruins the story. It did with this one. Jury is still asking if this story is worth saving, but with everything that adds to it, it's impossible to tell.
