The continuous pace of this movie falls to us for any shocks it can offer. There was no real tension. Most characters were unsatisfactory. The zealous Irish priest was as lame as the love interest. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose to offer the film's sensuality could be better. The central conflict of the main character was unimportant. This film is completely without positive effects. It's like a boring exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day, but anyway.
