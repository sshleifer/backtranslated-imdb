I saw it. It's not "good" but interesting in an understated way. The boys in it are quite naturalistic, but ... the graphic / gratuitous final gang rape scene is devastating and -so yes, the random insertion of World War II footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real terror with this misogynistic controversy. True cruelty is real - this film is just horrific. But the movie has a look that can draw you. But it seems to me the "Emperor's New Clothes", but the other way around. The movie looks good, but the direction, story, content and final feel you take away from this movie is empty. If a feeling can be evacuated, it is.
