I had the greatest enthusiasm in the preview for this movie. This is one of the oldest and most complex stories of mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (even for Tolkien). I have to say that it was a big deviation. They completely joked the plot and changed the thing into one long soap opera operation. The elements that were faithfully married to the plot were sprinkled in such a random way that the audience often laughed at the clumsy writing that only paid lip service to this battle of all fights. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of almost Matrix-like powers, utterly relentless and male lovers in the original poem) turning to "Fabio on the beach" in the cover from Pitt (who has a good script and more effort could have turned it into the most complex and original character ever made by Hollywood). The actors were actually decent and trying to make the best of a ridiculous writing. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle for them. Very drunk for the ladies to move over, but not enough battlefield for a movie about one long battle and siege. I would not recommend anyone pay to see that this story was dragged by the dirt, as one of the characters was (at least they did that part).
