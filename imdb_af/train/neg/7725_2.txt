This movie is one of the most unintentional bad action movies ever put into the movie. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough, but really brings together corny buddy buddy action, an eccentric and top villain, a cleaved love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time. You've got yourself the small suicide-invading drug for people who enjoy their life, yourself, and up to 'Showdown', they never thought they were killing themselves with a blow torch. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtitle isn't too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, and not to women. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's male parts, and before they commit suicide, Brandon tells Dolphy: "If we don't, I want to tell you, you have the biggest d --- I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> Now, what would an ordinary person say to another man? In an ACTION movie no less? And do you want them to be yourself? <br /> <br /> Later, there is this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (with regard to the villain): "I would like to cut off some parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Man, you have a fixation. " <br /> <br /> As the man at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, "Unfortunately Dolph does not respond to:" I have a fixation? I have a fixation?! You are the one who has decided she last words about my private going! I just cut his ears and his nose. "<br /> <br /> It is relentlessly stupid and fun if you are someone who enjoys root canals of unlicensed dentists without novocain. It's about par. Great fun for the whole family!
