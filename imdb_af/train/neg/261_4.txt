Jamie Foxx is fun, but this movie has been done before. The bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "In the Line of Fire". The police will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good old two sets of bad guys and one set police at him - all the time he just tries to turn a new leaf.
