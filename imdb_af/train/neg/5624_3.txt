In his short 40 years on Earth, writer Jack London managed to catch up with as much adventure and incident as possible. This 90-minute film, allegedly a biography of the man's life but fictional, has not even scratched the surface, and remains a story that is very ripe for a modern show. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, depicts London, and his performance is both rough and sympathetic. He's not the problem here. Also not a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, plays his future wife, Charmian, whose biography about London is the "base" for this movie. London's life was broken down into a series of episodes, which gently penetrate the film. So we have a brief incident with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold prospector in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese War ... deep treatment. And the guidance of Alfred Santell (he also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen", in 1939) at its best. To soften things here is a very poor quality DVD, with a crumbly print source and hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental was one of the DVD's extras: a catalog of all the alpha video films, with hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Let's just hope these movies are in better shape than Jack London!
