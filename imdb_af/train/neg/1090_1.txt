it was the most senseless movie I've ever seen, because there was no plot and the actors didn't seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot, I laughed so much, my ribs started to hurt. The little where the old men to catch Robert Duvall was ridiculous. At a directional level, a noir movie does not make much rain order and meaningless mimicry on the main character. It is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. Since it was based on a "manuscript" by John Grisham, I do not consider it as one of his book adaptations, as it does not contain the tension and the delightful storyline as films such as "the firm" or "the rainmaker '.
