Just okay horror movie about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement that they keep people picking them up from the street. Of course there is more to it, but to say more. <br /> <br /> For me it just didn't come together because it was trying to get it two ways, both as a family drama and a horror movie. The movie is trying very hard to make the front line between the two genres, but seems to stumble across the place as it tries to be shocking, something it never really is. It doesn't help that the last revelation is less frightened than an "oh", like "Oh, that's it?". Maybe if I didn't watch so many horror movies, it might have been better, or maybe it just looked like I didn't compare it so much. <br /> <br /> I'll pass
