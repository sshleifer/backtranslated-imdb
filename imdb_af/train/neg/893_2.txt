When I bought this DVD, I said, "It looks like it's a nice light comedy about love and relationships made in Portuguese standards. Let's give it a chance?" I was totally wrong! What a disappointing movie! First, it is not a comedy; It's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, the plot is so boring, and doesn't lead anywhere? It has no structure, it just flows like the wind in one direction or another? The production is also bad! The sound mix is ​​terrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me recall some old Portuguese movies from the 80's ?? The acting also had to be better ?? Well, to summarize, it's not with movies like this one that will improve Portuguese theater! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I've seen in the past year! Bad argument, bad acting, bad production? I had no high expectations for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever thought! Don't forget this!
