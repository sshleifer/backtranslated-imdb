Another poor third season entry, "Isn't there any beauty?" Yet at least one key plot element that would be very different and like Spock would have captivating. The main character is a stranger who has to be carried in a black box because his appearance is so terrible that it drives people crazy. It's too bad, the episode can't lead to this incredible premise. Of course, I think it was a mistake to ever show the stranger, as his real vision never approaches such a frightening build-up. All we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light that is used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is going through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, Kollos's appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr Spock, and then only if Spock wears a special sailor. (For the longest time I thought the alien name was Carlos, which I found humorous, but I'm going out.) Spock has to keep in mind at one point with Kollos, so the stranger can safely manage the Enterprise again. It's done, but when Spock / Kollos returns to end the mind, Spock forgets his vision. Uh Oh. He gets mad, but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos's assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. It might have been a very bizarre, excellent episode, but it is poorly targeted and presents a bad performance of the series' previous season.
