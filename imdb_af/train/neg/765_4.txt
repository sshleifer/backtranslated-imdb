Seriously, what do they think? Over the course of the year, the Columbo series has made some new things and deviated from the usual successful formula, but this film really does surprise it. This movie is basically very different from any other Columbo movie, but the differences are not for the good of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing that makes this movie different from any other Columbo movie is the fact that there was no murder. The whole premise of this movie is completely different and puts the Columbo character in a totally different environment and situation. The overall is also completely different and more 'modernized'. <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has had other Columbo movies in the past, all of which have met the regular formula. It also makes it a strange choice he has chosen to manage this movie. <br /> <br /> The Columbo character himself also feels very different, perhaps because of why he is placed in a totally different environment and situation when he helps his cousin after his bride right after the wedding disappeared. The absence of some good lighting and branding of Columbo humor doesn't make it a good or enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the movie doesn't start too badly, but the movie becomes more and more mockery of its story as it progresses. It is such a stupid written kidnapping thriller with a story that is becoming increasingly unlikely. It also makes the movie more and more uncompromising. It's a very interesting Columbo entry that doesn't really know how to entertain its viewers in any way. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented. Despite the fact that his character is in such a completely different situation and the film has been shot in such a completely different style, Peter Falk is still good and his presence saves this film quite a bit. Can you just imagine how this movie would have been without him? It would be a very bad and ridiculous cheap movie that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> An independent Columbo entry, which can be described as a failed experiment to derive from the regular formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
