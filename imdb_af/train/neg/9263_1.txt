What was the handling of the clothes? They were all dressed like something from the early 70's early 80's. The cars were even outdated. The school was outdated. The nuns' clothes were outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40's, with its wards and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the whole movie it implied took place in 1991. My mother laughed and said, "Geeeee-od! WHEN was this movie made?" When we hit the "INFO BUTTON" on our remote, we were sure that 1991 had to be ticked! Did anyone else notice it? My FAVORITE part, however, was when the woman told her opieksmuck man on the phone about the reverse cross in the mirror and he just said: Well, look, I have a congressional meeting. I'll talk to you later about it. "This line was just classic. Just like a man! My mother's favorite part was when they gave the "Herb of the Devil Child" her own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Just what the devil's calf needs ... a Rottweiler." She also enjoyed all the people falling into the churches and clipped their coffins. Her OTHER favorite part was the man at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, driving right into the truck / truck / front loader thing. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he just kept on, with a real stupid look on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to a school parking lot?!?! Whatever!
