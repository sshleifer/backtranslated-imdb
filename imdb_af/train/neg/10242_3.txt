This movie was made by a lot of white guys who went to school together. Well, there is nothing wrong with that, except it seems to have been made by a lot of white guys who went to school together. 90 percent of the role players are white men about the same age. It's almost like seeing a lot of guys at the camp who changed the camera to themselves. The movie has no plot. It just repeats the same action of massacre after massacre. There are some funny scenes and comic pieces. But they don't leave the flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover things that were apparently out of their budget or resources and didn't do very well with it. Anything that can't be done with white guys walking around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after seeing the trailer, which looks like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. The rest of it just repeats the same kind of everyday, inward comedy. It sometimes works, but it gets boring after the same things come over to you. It is more like a rope Satuday Night Live sketch as a movie. It's a hit-over-the-head-with-the-kind comedy. I can see where the story idea intrigues. But in this movie post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says the story ideas come from that era. He plans to make part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe a parody thing. <br /> <br /> At the opening in LA, Wheatley said he would return about the same part in part 2. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse role in the next one, after which he replied, yes.
