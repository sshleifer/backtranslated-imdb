After watching this movie, I was so upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life. It's 2 hours, I'll never come back. Ugh. If you start it, you might think, "Wow, it's really good!" But be sure that first impressions mean nothing. I was so excited about this movie to the silly end I've ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The play is vague, the story line is all but original and there is nothing special about it, except that it is the SUCCESS MOVIE EVER !!! Don't See This Movie !!! WARNING !! DUMBEST MOVIE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SORRY IF YOU REMOVE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE! 10/01
