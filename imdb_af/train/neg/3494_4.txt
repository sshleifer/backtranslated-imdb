Taking into account his popularity, I got this movie a great disappointment. Maybe I expected too much from this movie. This is one of the best-known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never find out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very spoken movie with sporadic action series. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story didn't offer a character for which I could root, since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he cannot hide the dazzling imperfections that occur in the narrative. I know it's not supposed to be high art, but I found the movie boring. Certainly not the best example of this much-loved genre. His cult status escapes me. I advise you to skip it.
