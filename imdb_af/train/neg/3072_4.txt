Margret Laurence is unlikely to accept any of her film novels, let alone the Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dares, anyone?), And ultimately sacrificed her humanity. The symbols in the book (the Steen Engel, Silver Topic, etc.) are constant memories of this battle of the old and the new, and the bloodbath (so to speak) on the way. <br /> <br /> While the movie is pretty faithful to the plot of the book (but it's not really a plot kind of storytelling, is it?), I think it's missing the point to the spirit of the movie to capture. Hagar's resistance (for the sake of resistance) was not there. Bram could have been much tougher than depicted, and Hagar's father could be more traditionally played. If the filmmaker were to demand stronger images, the film would go straight to the home. <br /> <br /> Similarly, why should we see cell phones, organic products and other modernizations? Try to make a few points for making certain points (eg the Muslim friend and the Natives). Hagar and co. is everything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see it in the movie version. Modernization could be an excuse for a low budget transaction, but used as an excuse to send subliminal politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and the film). It seems to be bumping under the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also the audience. We seem to be conditioned to love bitter old people as cute and cute. Why should laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh, or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and anxious, and all we do is laugh at them. I don't think that Hagar and other people in her situation had any justice.
