Ok first, this movie sucks. But we can investigate why. The statement that a machine is capable of converting matter into energy, storing it, then transporting and rebuilding it is at least intriguing. But this is as far as they take this point of departure. Instead of delving into what might happen if someone made this kind of machine, they broke the damn thing. It could have been a good starting point. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, that is, the invisible man. But no, they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor jerry-straighten the thing, and tries to transport himself. Just to throw it through his beautiful but stupid dominee (duh). What would not happen if Lembach did not decide to leave. So now he is hitting the countryside, killing people because his little experiment failed, and they didn't want to give him money. Wah. Then make the movie worse, throw a dry British relationship between the two semi-skilled professors hired to help him. Between their love sessions, they make a few half-hearted efforts to get him killed while killing half of London. All these things could be brought about by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried to give it a fair 2 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they didn't break the damn machine, leave Lembach and try it again. Damn Your Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
