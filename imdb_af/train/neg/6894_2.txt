It is sad when you can see what a movie is trying to do, and it is very clear that it has fallen far from the point. Film students should take it as a lesson and a warning. Would graduate have an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, leads, produces, his film masterpiece himself. Usually his concept is far above his budget. Usually he writes a scrapbook of every brand rule he can come to. Usually, he is more interested in the great facts of the story, rather than on the greasy work of working with actors on individual scenes. Usually he ends with a movie that is weak in trying to create miracles on a small budget. Usually he ends up with a series of encounters (we can't do justice by mentioning their scene) who feels as if they were written by a 12-year-old. And usually he ends up with bad acting that doesn't grab the viewer. Looking at Judges from this perspective, you can immediately say it's just the usual rate.
