terrible, just awful! my old roommate watched this litter and it made me crazy. The book is one of my favorites and it is a pity that some people will never know what it really is, because their first impressions are dribbling like this. they have changed so much that it is almost recognizable. which confuses me, as the book lends itself like a soap opera, providing enough food for modern entertainment. It's like one of those lifelong movies that says "based on a true story," but is totally fictitious. There is nothing about the emotion or depth of the book, just unrelenting melodrama. If you're a high school student looking for a way to read, I suggest you try a different version.
