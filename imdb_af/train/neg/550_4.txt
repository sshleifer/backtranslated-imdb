After the excellent AHANK (2002) which was a remake of a Gujarati play, he comes with WAQT which also looks like a play. <br /> <br /> In stage games we have characters screaming, /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh almost joking the 40+ Akshay Kumar which looks too funny like a small nerd <br /> <br / > The film has a good message of not spoiling your son, but unfortunately the road Amitabh wants Akki to be responsible is absolutely fake <br /> <br /> Even his reason to hide his illness, His career from hospital and Akki's melodramatic speech is a deterrent. <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you, but most are up. <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is hilarious, but also stretched in the second half. <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is redundant, although some scenes are good. Music is cute <br /> <br /> Amitabh overdo it in the first half but is excellent in emotional scenes. Akshay Kumar also does his part well, but also looks uncomfortable in some too many py scenes. His chemistry with Bachchan is indifferent Rajpal is a highlight; He's a riot. Boman is good in some comic parts, but too loud in places. Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do, it's her last movie with Akki so far. Shefali is wonderful, but she looks too young for Bachchan
