Robert Wagner is the evil boss of Digicron, a telecommunications company that kills people. <br /> <br /> "So you say the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - it may be medically possible but not possible from my system" <br /> <br /> "I have to some new virus software of my own writing to catch it - it can take time '<br /> <br />' but it's not about the software, it kills people. <br /> <br /> Look out for the "I'm in Virology" love moment and perhaps the first time filming to indicate death with a braille keyboard.
