Watched a trailer for this on another video, and decided to rent when it came out. Boy, was I disappointed! The story is very boring, the play (except Christopher Walken) is bad, and I can't care less about the characters, except that I really want Nora's husband to be beaten. Christopher Walken's role is such a throw away, which is a plague!
