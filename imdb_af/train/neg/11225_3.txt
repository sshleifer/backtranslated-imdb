This documentary version is a reenactment of the past few years of Betty Page's (Paige Richards) career. The Tennessee War was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetish, slavery and cat-girly flicks. Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) at his Movie Star News instructed Betty to do the camera. There were no celebrities in the well-known photos or "stag movies", but Klaw was accused of spreading obscene material at the time and was ordered to destroy them to avoid persecution. It is no surprise that Betty follows a cult at the height of her career. The girl next door with radiant black hair, blue eyes and an hour-glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not will rejoice for decades. After all, she was said to have been photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and only for the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie could have been much better; but good enough to be interested. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is stunning in his own right. Bra, pantyhose, belt belt and snake doesn't hurt her image in the least. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be advised this movie can change your heartbeat.
