If I could say it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt my money was not completely wasted. <br /> <br /> I saw Steven Segal's On Deadly Ground. <br /> <br /> This movie should see a resurrection though on MST 3K. If the Santa Claus wins, the Martians can explode the head of Tom Servo, but one wonders what the evil this movie can cause. <br /> <br /> There's a very good reason why Kurt Thomas never had a movie. <br /> <The authors of this drink have to be forced to carry posters every day saying: "Text slaps me! I was a writer at Gymkata."
