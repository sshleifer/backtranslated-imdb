This show isn't smart. It's basically what it's all about. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to subtract from completely biting the rest of the world's forestry is just rude. In another comment, someone calls some hilarious lines. The point of view for me was George H.W. Bush tells the kids that they shouldn't see a television, except Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with the folly of this unfortunate excuse for political satire is that these people get a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush is not a good president. We all do. But it is not an excuse to pronounce this total punk-time waste. I put these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula bites as much as you already know unknown jokes, and throws in even worse original material to actually give yourself credit. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Unsuitable, and it makes me more and more unhappy that the crap has been renewed like this, but incredible and original programs such as Arrested Development are capped after 3 solid seasons. Please do not look at this shit unless you are one of the green-blooded liberal hippies who regard any sense with the words Bush and stupid is comic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. All he does is a bit of a Texan accent, and get very hard at the end of his senses. At least South Park admits the votes are not accurate. If you want a funny political satire, see Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is nice to watch, as the animation of the Stop Motion action has been done extremely well. Search for George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube. priceless
