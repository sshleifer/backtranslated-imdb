This film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his mean points in Math. He has never made the best experiences in life before and has serious self-esteem issues. After a rough start at his new school, he began to make friends, fall in love with a girl and some American teenage boys. <br /> <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way. , with the emphasis on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you don't already like this story review, save your time and look something else. If you do, please be aware of the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then he is constantly sorry. For me, he wasn't such a lovely loser, with whom you can feel sympathetic and laugh. Instead, he and his behavior irritated me very much and with my own teens not so far I could hardly stand to look. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie is not trying to be realistic and seems to be the story, but my experience of the characters is just not (except Janosch might). And yes, I know this movie is based on an autobiography written by a 17-year-old. But I have some experiences with German schools and German youth, and I don't believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) The sexual awakening is really an important thing for a movie with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do an "Ejaculate on the Cookie" checker where everyone has to cook a sperm during mass masturbation in the forest and the loser must then eat the sperm wet cookie. Although it has entertained me in a slight way, it is not funny, nor is it the serious effort of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a subplot about Benjamin's family and his dad betrays his wife - still, I don't know why it's there and where to put it. It just bored me. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hated this movie because I had the character of Benjamin, without a message, concept, scheme, whatever and it failed efforts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people find it meaningful and touching. If you like "The Other Sister", you will probably also have this one. I both hated. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys should not write an autobiography, and if they do, it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
