The British heritage film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why should they all be filmed by talented nobies? This film rips the mouth of Orwell's tough novel, making it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no one who reads it can forget his beautiful portrayal of poverty. Orwell not only emphasizes the cold and hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock is praying for a squadron of bombers. But this film stretches out of anything that can be disturbing in any way, and rather creates a very nostalgic journey to the charm of the 1930s in London, where everything burns with golden sunlight and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and full of fresh scrub eggs and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp winds that flow over the rubbish rays seem completely out of place in this chocolate boxing world. Worst of all is the inexorable bonhomie of the screenplay, old jokes and sound dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of good actors. But it's nothing for nothing. This movie made me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of its wealth, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We use mere nobody to turn it into soft-centered, anodyne porridge for people who want to feel like a culture while drinking their Horlicks and quietly.
