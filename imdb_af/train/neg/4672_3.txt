This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a good job as the relentless dad. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is popy as the daughter and is not a match for Olivia De Havilland's much more nuanced, adult delivery in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist leaning conclusion is also against the harsh conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, has cruelly parodied in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
