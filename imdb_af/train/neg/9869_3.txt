Didn't mind the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** It was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. so now i look like a dummy, but i think i will still submit my comments. And yes, British Columbia is beautiful *** Or why did they take it from its South Carolina coastal environment? (This question stands) The place was essential to the book's substance and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie. Oh, I just read where I should write at least ten lines. Here's my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all out of the book. I know the book was the book and the movie; good not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. The book also evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feeling of the story and it did not look like the characters.
