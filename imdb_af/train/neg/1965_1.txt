Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and set it in horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground", is an awkward piece of junk. Now I noticed his name about this particular movie, I would have returned it, but no, I didn't turn on my glasses and therefore I missed it, sorry, I really should bring it with me while video Shopping. The first question would be, who is the target audience for this? It's almost like a "frightening" children's movie, but then again there are topless babes and a few gore and a few bad words spat there and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with some sort of farm outfits. Seems like a guy opens a bed and breakfast with a checkered past, a childhood witch who has collected children's teeth. Probably something that the broker did not mention. Of course now in the present day there is a little girl to warn the true little girl now living there that something bad is going to happen. It does, and there are also two Bubbas hanging on that property when the new owner took over so they also revenge. This whole thing has the feel of some messing up for the kids at Halloween, except of course the things that are not suitable for small children. It's not just mediocre, it's also confused. A big buoy and diagonal to Anchor Bay to postpone it too, taking into account their usual record of fine releases, is a new layer. The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get "The Tooth Fairy". Hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute refuse.
