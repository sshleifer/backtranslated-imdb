When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was musical. Like "The Harvey Girls." It's not. It is a pudding that boils over, strikes the kitchen ceiling, and is potted and pasted together. No music and not a period, but unlikely. <br /> <br /> It starts with patriarch James Woods, who tells the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who becomes Barbara Stanwyck, that she must maintain and home the family name. <br /> <br /> So we think it's going to be a historical intergenerational story. And it's been a short while. Then it gets in the story of cold sadness Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead to him? Well, why else? As we learn in a strange flagship story told by Stanwyck, she once thought she could inherit money (for her sisters as well as herself) by marrying. She hit someone who she took to be a potty pot, which was actually the emerging lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> Let somebody think the child they had, a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot, is - well, you know ... They had a hasty marriage and in the very short time they were together. He is pregnant. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, played by Gig Young. The other sister tried to take him away. Even so. <br /> <br /> It's a shrill, unrelenting mess - well done but without a bit of logic or credibility.
