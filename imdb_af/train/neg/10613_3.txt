The dance was probably the only observable thing about this movie - and even that was disappointing compared to other films. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me this is the worst kind of movie - one that assumes it's a work of art, because it has all the bumps of movie-as-art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but ultimately the depth and tension of the dance lacks the film so-called. Tango is a pest, it's hot, it has drama, it's noisy - exactly what this movie is not.
