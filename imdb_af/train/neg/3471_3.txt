This movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was seriously NOT trying to act in any way, shape or form. He sucked completely. Nothing about the movie was credible. The first problems were in the intro- where the man gave everything to the Victim of the Salvation Army, but it didn't show why. And then the grandmother hits her head in the oven - really nice, and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - it's not even in the same tone of the movie. There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; there were no credible responses by the family he chose; and people are carried away here and there, without swinging. (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters descend a steep slope - it's the incident that suddenly falls in love with him.) Anyway, there was a funny moment or two, but they were a rarity the movie. It needs another rewrite (or 4). Hope you enjoy!
