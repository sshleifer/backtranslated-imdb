I rented this movie and today thought it could be a good football video, as I am a great soccer fan. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is far too religious and pastor and is VERY unrealistic. This movie says pretty much that if you can get a Christian, anything you want to live in is like a big soccer player! You don't become a good soccer player by becoming Christian and asking God, you do it through exercise and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he'll give you something .... puh-lease. That's not true, duh. I laughed a few times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was funny when they were stupid (Shultz the cartoonist? No, the man who flew across the Atlantic, and so on.) But really this movie wasn't that good. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
