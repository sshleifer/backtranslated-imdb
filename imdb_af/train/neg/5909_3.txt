The 5 minute opening gave me hope. Then Meyers proved that he had only one good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolute lowest common denominator humor. Painful viewing. A complete task. Undoubtedly written in less than a week, just like the first one. Give Meyers the hook and join him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And don't let him out until he has developed a decent script for something. He's got it in him. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let Goldmember sink without track.
