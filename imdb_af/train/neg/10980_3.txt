A terrifying movie. Feel like it was made in the early 90's by a straight-forward person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, mainstream aspiring people. Retrograde to the point of being offensive suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred pathway for salvation for sad, lonely, sexually-minded gays. Wow! What did you know? The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the slight buffoon, the bitter, lonely queen, the fag hag, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle class, middle class, of little interest. <br /> <br /> As far as the romantic and ideological struggle of the main couple is concerned, there is not much to say: we have seen it before and done much better.
