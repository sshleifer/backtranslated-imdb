*** Possible Plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I adore Dennis Hopper. I question why he accepted the role of a police detective in The Spreading Ground in 2000. This movie is sucking and I'm going to tell you why. <br /> <br /> It's about a small town that will get a sports arena contract. One hitch: there's a killer on the loose and it's bad for business. The mayor made an agreement with the Irish Mob to get the murderer and make sure he never made it in court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this man to be caught, but he is on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system, it's work. <br /> <br /> It could have been pretty good. It could have sounded like that. It was terrible. First, they notice this man a Serial Killer. Errnr. There are specific criteria and nothing fits here. The bad man killed 5 children the first day and I think it was 2 the second day. This whole movie spans 48 hours .... Rare Serial Killer action. I don't care what crazy motives they finally give him, Serial Killers do their thing over a long time. Not only do they kill 7 children in two days. It's a Spree. <br /> <br /> Ok that was annoying, the scene was horrible. The only name here was Hopper, and he is the only one who even got close to pulling off his part. Unfortunately, he is similar to me and I think he does psychologically much, much better. It wasn't just a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he did best, and that was all scary. It's not that he did badly, that's what I saw him so much better. <br /> <br /> Irish Mob man Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - Long day's journey at night), in charge of their investigation, is just above the tightest. Inconsistency? Not really. He is playing the cold, hard kind of guy and he does it to the point that the character is just wood. Drilling to the maximum. He didn't scare me. He didn't inspire any emotion except boredom. I can't tell you how many times I've checked to see how much longer it was until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this is that it had the feeling of a TV made for television. . You know what I mean. The poor production values, low budget, reuse of scenes to save costs. Not right. Yanno? But I feel comparable to those who are insulting to those. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can't help feeling that Hopper had to take this role as a personal favor to a friend. That's the only rational I can come to. It was Vanlint's first job as director, third as a cinematographer. Hopefully this is a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin the end if you decide to torture yourself with this one, but I want to say they all dropped the ball here. Hopper. In a scene that had to be emotionally tired of the detective, it was just .. well .. blah. I have not seen the fear that will accompany the total gear change this man has made. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> These 100-minute minutes and rated R for violence and language. No child under 13 will have any interest in viewing it, so no worries. It is not suitable for anyone. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You will thank me later.
