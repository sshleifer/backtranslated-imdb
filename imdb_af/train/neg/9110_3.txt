I watched the movie at 3am in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But I still think it wasn't good, this movie was not good at all. The reasons are many. <br /> <br /> The acting is not so good, and time and again, situations in it remind me of a poor 90's Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come up like the handcuff situation and the poker situation among the servants ... This movie was so much based on the first one, and that's OK. But if I didn't see the first one before I saw it, it would have sucked even worse. Like the end it came very suddenly and I felt like I didn't have a closure so ever ... Sebastian suddenly changed and this movie looks like it's just made to explain No. 1 and like no time or trouble was not used to make anything else good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They had to handle the more style and class situations, but they didn't, and therefore this movie went bad ...
