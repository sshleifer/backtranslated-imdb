Director Spike Lee is known for making films that point out racism. In many of the films, like "Do the right thing," most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism again the whole thing. <br /> <br /> What Lee proves, however, is his contradiction to Christianity. It is incredibly the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else produced this kind of bias against another group, would he be avenged, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and places the smoldering gun on top of his Bible. They zoom in on it for another option only if you missed it. Hey, people, here's another Bible reader and see how he is! Lee does something about every movie he makes. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred when dealing with racial relations. Who can argue with the portrayal of racism as an evil thing? However, Lee claims it in this movie as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards white people doesn't help the situation. It just adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "come over it." <br /> <br /> It's too bad because the subject has made for a thought-producing movie if it's done with objectivity and intelligence.
