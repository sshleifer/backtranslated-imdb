It was the tag line "in the tradition of American Pie" that bothered me to rent this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in the style of Jackass, with the big difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie looks like a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie regrets that I have rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10, because now I can't go under it. This one makes pretty bad movies like cinematic feats. <br /> <br /> I actually switched it off after 45 minutes, and that's something I rarely do. But it was just too boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Can't believe some people actually rewarded it with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Do you fall on the head if you were just a kid? Or was it the first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare it to? Are you another virgin and is it all you ever think? Something should be at least wrong. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this one. Even if you're in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't think, choose something else or you'll regret it.
