Heather Graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the movie producers think they are? the ABSOLUTE WORST, the most UNREALISTIC film I've ever seen, as long as I can remember. This movie is so bad that I have been forced to report to IMDb and make sure the rating of this "movie" falls. <br /> <br /> I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunk chick, so while she's over, I'm actually going to walk around in my room for HOURS asking me frantically. "What did I do?" Jesus Heather, come over it and grow up ... and I would like to convey sentiment to the idiot producers ... and while I'm on it, instead of this movie all about a pathetic excuse for an outing, it would maybe more suited to focus the plot on a character that is spiritually unstable. .. like your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know the first time I had gay sex, when I left the next morning, I jumped in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, get a grip ... <br /> <br /> WHAT A JACK! and please note that there are many more mistakes and horrible stupidity to this lame movie, but I'm so sick to even think about it. If you are a smart person, you will hate this movie, and if you are not smart, you will love it. It's that simple.
