What a joke. I watch it on Channel 1 and I think how paint is dry is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien who called him this nightmare. Terrible play, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of tension, but it's more of a comedy. If you want to see horrible acting, ridiculous writing and sub-par plot, look at this movie. If I was Van Dien, I didn't just ask my 10% of my agent, but make the bastard in the process. What a turkey. It's not even suitable to be on MST 3K! It will be a good movie to heal your insomnia. I especially love the part where Van Dien is thrown overboard and make it back in just a few minutes! I can only imagine that it was written by non-union writers who benefit from the writer's strike. What a terrible movie !!!
