<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven eventually bombed this one. He was joking on himself. Once again, we have a movie that includes sex and violence, immorality, women's learning, and many attentive talks between the characters and dollying pans. <br /> <br /> It's all for nothing. Because they are not in this movie at all. It eats all its solid pieces. All the actors give the kind of performances of a Verhoeven movie. In other words, indifferent to acting on virtually every level. Starship Troopers got away because it was such a macho world that inhabited the characters. These scientists act in the same way. Sorry Paul, but Soldiers and Scientists are not really made the same mindset. <br /> <br /> One big mistake in the plot was that after one night escaping to do bad things, Kevin Bacon's character then came back to the science lab where we had spent more than enough time doing this watching animated manikens (Elizabeth Shue excluded) walking and talking. Why not show the extent of what the character can do in the outside world. How can they possibly follow him if he can be at all ??? Think of all the different things that could be done with this concept, both in terms of story and characterization. Then look at what this film is doing and you've really done so much and watched the whole project really be. <br /> <br /> More insult is the Doco on the DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MAd Genius. Well, one in two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing to do with it. As the title says. <br /> <br /> Hol!
