Hilarious, laughing aloud moments ... and yet not a comedy. I especially liked the planted gag of the ambulance screaming the "dirty bum", which then screamed in their rage. "You dirty bombs", I mean wow, someone's online degree in literature pays off! The worst script imaginable, with intriguing introductions in a moment, ridiculous movement in the story, zero character development (even among the characters who meet. It's as if they've known and trusted each other for years). Dodgy agrees with added echo effects, and plot holes. O God, there are plots! To be honest, I do not even write the whole thing, but I definitely expect the last 30 minutes or so not to improve the already pathetic film effort. Thanks, we have good progress, lead to anything we forget that the movie is a burden of ... well ... use your imagination to conclude that particular sentence!
