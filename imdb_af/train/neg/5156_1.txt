"Laughter is a state of mind," says the marker, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's comments. What could he think while making "Toys"? When he looked at the hustle and bustle, did he see a successful, funny fantasy? If so, he works on a different level from me. It's a stupid picture, the production design of which is 90% of the thing (and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as a brother and sister of a toy magician who is circumvented as factory heirs when their father dies. There is nothing extremely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on the screen here. It is uniformly thin, ugly, and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO stars from ****
