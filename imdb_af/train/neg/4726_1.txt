Another film about a tortured, self-centered, arrogant, uncomfortable, hateful, self-destructive main character that we should care about. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I am very open to all kinds of wall films that, as the main character, have a strong self-destructive character. What I object to is that there is so little background for this man. Why has this man hated himself and the world? If the writing received more attention, they managed to evoke sympathy for him. As it is, he just comes out as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, not hateful. <br /> <br /> Having made great efforts to make this man as crazy and anti-social as possible, his fate is as dark as possible, the author then has the nerve to make a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's in a good fight! Man! Don't waste your time.
