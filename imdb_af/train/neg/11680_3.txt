This movie had so much potential - a strong role, a fairly strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but each of those elements was wasted. The story went nowhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring, useless, waste of a movie. I hated it. Judging from the other voices, I'm in the minority here and should be some sort of freak. However, I thought this movie was terrible. I had a lot of hope, but I was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was Jody Foster's character. A lot of cocky "fixer" of types makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington plays the same character he always plays - nice but nothing new.
