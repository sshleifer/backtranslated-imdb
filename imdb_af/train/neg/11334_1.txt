Here is another blasphemous European story in which they blast the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I'm not Catholic). <br /> <br /> It actually won an Oscar for foreign film. That's probably because the story that Catholic and religious beliefs generally look extremely poor. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He was portrayed as nothing but an idiot. No wonder the secular-dominated academy loved this movie. <br /> <br /> There are also some drugs that a man plays that deny his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters in the story. The girls take turns to seduce the "seminar" student (who says he is studying for six years but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemy is this movie ?? !!! <br /> <br /> It's a shame and another great example of the secular-progressive story of the movie business worldwide (not just Hollywood).
