Really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and poor as a supplement. <br /> <br /> This vampire hunter story is the worst I have seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico looking for some blood suckers! He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade) and is part of a van Hunts vampire's hunters only? OK, but he works alone. He was dedicated to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen seeking a black crucifix to perform a ritual that would enable her to be unwavering for sunlight (almost a successor to vampires (1998) by John Carpenter directed and James Woods dies. Derek begins his quest for the Queen's search with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really too bad), a teenager without experience, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner ), a particular vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another expert vampire hunter. So naturally in this adventure he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can begin to feel this movie just looking at its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi). is a big difference in acting quality compared to James Woods, and if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this section), you become involved in one of the simplest stories, completely predictable, with terribly acting. , very bad special effects and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> I recommend not watching this movie !, rent another movie, watch another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
