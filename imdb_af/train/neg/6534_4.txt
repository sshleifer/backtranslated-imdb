This sci-fi adventure is not the best and is not the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. Bizarre pink tingling and unusual special effects make it a favorite for late, late, late-lookers. Space explorers on the planet Mars fights strange alien amoeba monsters and other alien creatures. Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The film includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfortable and enjoy. Don't feel bad if you nod for a moment. I agree with the addition of this to the list of cult classes not to miss.
