This movie is simply too long, too frequent, with the male nudity and sexuality (as it is called a gay with my own collection of adult titles) too much for free and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down for up to ten minutes, and could have been equally effective without trying the patience (and endurance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on an early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival; the type of crowd tending to be more adventurous is interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as one without much dialogue, shorts, foreign films. The nearby crowd in an approximately 275-seat theater began to dribble in the first half of the film and while the vast majority remain for the "pay-off" (which never actually arrived), I've never had about 14 years had not. from attending any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, as such a large number of people leave a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily be cut off by more than half and as effective as it was. It could also have gone in different directions, still with a shorter run time, and was much more effective. <br /> <br /> As it currently exists, it is not something that one can easily recommend or one that I would not want to look at again.
