It is a movie that belongs firmly to the 50's. Very surprising that American Film Institute has chosen this one by one for the best 100 American films of all time. I saw almost all the movies on that list, and this one is by far the most disappointing one of them. Music numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY overblown and boring, and have absolutely no connection with the story. The end of the movie has a very long ballet sequence, which obviously has no real relation to the story of the movie. It must be acknowledged, it is very well made, the music is right, and the dance is done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is extremely childish and unacceptable and acts in an unpolite way. His spiritual age is about 14. If you want to see a good music role made in the "golden age" of musicals, watch "Singing in the Rain".
