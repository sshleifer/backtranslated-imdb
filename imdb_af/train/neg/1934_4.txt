Follow the usual formula to set up a new site - this time, the first African American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman denied the armed forces - was run by the US Navy's deep-sea dive training program run by a racist zeal ( Robert DeNiro). If the program was not bad enough, it should be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and shouts effectively. Cuba Gooding, who is raised by a strict father as a poor black farm son in the South, is expecting regency. The girls - one can hardly call them women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have small roles and are mostly there to argue that their husbands should exercise common sense. Other decent artists - Forces Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more perfunctory roles. <br /> <br /> It's about it. Almost everything could be gathered through a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro greetings indoors, uncovered. After a brutal attack on hospital staff, he is transferred from his outfit, rather than brushing. Someone shouted, "I'm out here" in the early 1950s. (Perhaps it was a common expression at the time. If so, "my bad.") People speak to each other according to rank - "Lieutenant", "Boatswain's Mate", "Commander", as they do in the army. The fleet is simply "sir" (as an officer) or addressed to them from (if designated). I didn't bother to see if there was a rank called "Senior Master Head" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a hard drive to have. Everyone in the Navy, it seems, hates Ninth, except for one man from Wisconsin. He supported and was held in contempt by the others in his class. It's like the scene in "Animal House", in which the request of a Tony brotherhood is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a designated man, a second-class minor. He manages a beautiful woman who has just graduated from the medical school. In one of their arguments she pleads with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he has to join her, leave the fleet and live a quiet life. "And let life pass you by?", He says. Yes. Yes, just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by. You can depart from the golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> This kind of flash was common enough in World War II. "Bombardier," "Airial Gunner," that sort of thing. Cheap as they were often, they have some educational features. You've learned something to become a bomber or a shooter. Here the technical details are skipped, perhaps because the writer didn't know anything about them (except Boyle's law that we learned in high school chemistry.) <br /> <br /> I couldn't follow what happened during some of the emergencies without which a movie would not exist. If I had the mechanical problems right, it was because I guessed right. The direction is also no help. The movie thrives in close ups, so much so that they lose any dramatic impact they might have. And the emergencies are confusing because they are sickly focused. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Do you want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Hardly any will do it - except perhaps "G. I. Jane", in which the abused hero is a heroin. Try the exercise cam titles in "The Young Lions." There is the victim a Jew. Or try "From here to eternity" in which no easy sympathetic buttons are pressed and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bend and is active in bringing the conflict, just like "Cool Hand Luke." No easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easy. <br /> <br /> Formulate well, and not do well.
