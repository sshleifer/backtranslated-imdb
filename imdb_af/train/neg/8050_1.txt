just below the surface what? A simple horrible movie is what. <br /> <br /> As other viewers have just commented, the storm ranges are just ridiculous. To cut already seasoned firewood in the pouring rain? now it's smart. threat? ominous? sexual tension? For those who sow and confront, sow and confront and sow and confront too much. <br /> <br /> I want to say thank you to my sara's landfill, but in retrospect I think the producers of the movie, seeing the completed mess realized that they had to put something into making it halfway worthwhile. so it just becomes another privilege. Do yourself a favor and give it a miss.
