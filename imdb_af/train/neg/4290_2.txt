I will give this movie two stars because it looks like beautiful photography. Otherwise it comes mainly from clich√©s and stereotypes: mountain people are either stupid white waste from the fanatical religious or racial racist type, or wise, white Indians. Indians are magical people who move around without a sound, can disappear in a blink of an eye, speak animals, and read thoughts about great distances. And so on, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film I wondered what the point of the movie was (except that I have beautiful pictures of mountains, log cabins, bushes, a variety of animals, enthusiastic mountain dwellers and freaky people in the church ). <br /> <br /> The plot has touched on a whole host of issues, but no one has thoroughly investigated them. It was also not a story about growing up during the depression, whether it was an orphan or a struggle for identity. It tried to be all those things and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is about Little Tree's education, we hardly learn anything about it. He gave a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; He sought his hand to cut wood (with which he failed) and run whiskey (literally); learned how to read (and maybe write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently, he did not learn much during his boarding school in the boarding school because he was locked in the attic. <br /> <br /> But grandmother and grandfather and Graham Greene's character made sure that Little Tree eventually became a very spiritual person whose main purpose as an adult, and I paraphrase here, "ride the Navajos" and "caught in a few wars" - was "catching up" with grandma and grandfather and Graham Greene's character in heaven (instead of saying, dating girls, marriage, kids or other such nonsense). <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I have to say I found Grandpa's trading offer. Why had it always been a whiskey? To counter the stereotype of the "drunk Indian"?
