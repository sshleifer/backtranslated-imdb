I didn't know if I'd laugh or cry. Only addicted fans of danni filth can taste here. It is supposed to be a horror movie, but there is only dirt in this. The coolest scene is the car crash, with the real special effects of Hollywood's best. Avoid this movie at all costs. Just watch it for studies of how bad a movie can be ................
