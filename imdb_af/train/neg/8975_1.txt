... said a couple left the movie just as I entered here to see it. Hmm, not a good sign, but who knows? Different strokes for different people. Well, no. They were friendly. Godard released work that is passionate (contempt), entertaining (Band of Outsiders), sometimes both (My life to live). It's just faint intellectualism, which quickly congratulates on the nerves. During my performance, half of the audience literally walked out at the end of the film. If I was just as wise.
