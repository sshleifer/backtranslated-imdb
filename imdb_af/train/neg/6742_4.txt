For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film at the end of the experience, based on the mistiness of my eyes. Unfortunately for the "Wedding Date", I can only judge the movie with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I didn't see much chemistry between them. two characters. The assumption of the movie is a reverse "Pretty Woman", with Dermot playing the role of Nick, an affordable male escort hired by Debra's character Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue was forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks in the relationship between Nick and Kat. <br /> <br /> In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a supporter of Kat's sister. When Amy gets on the screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams was cast into the role of Kat, the movie might have been more dynamic. But as it turned out, instead of reaching for Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine in an effort to at least think that this movie had a real sentiment and romance.
