Of course, very talented behind-the-scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you just keep it against them. No one was interested in this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones. The "monsters" were the unemployed worm of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejects alien designs in Alien. Of course, the creators of the movie did not want to overshadow the third-class movie samples, so they helped their actors who could not memorize their lines, or in some cases pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly improper to just send what is supposed to happen if there is something. If you're unlucky enough to be in a theater where this movie is being shown, and you're not going out, you'll laugh at what is supposed to be terrifying or exciting moments of the movie. The incompatibility of various scenes will only surprise you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of Curse Words' carries the feel of someone paying it. If you have to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain at the video store. If there is any right in the film industry, one of the main players will be to let it out to you.
