this animation Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very poor, and there is little action.most of the characters are given little to nothing to do. The movie is generous, but doesn't really come true and is meaningless, but just watches and is nowhere near the caliber of the 80s animated TV show. It's not a movie that looks again, at least in my mind. It's only about 74 minutes, including credits, so I think it's a good thing. Unique in the TV show, the characters are not worth it to root here. In the show you wanted to save Inspector Gadget the day, but there, who really care? Anyway, it's just my opinion. For my Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing 3/10
