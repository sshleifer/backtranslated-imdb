I'm not a big fan of the Stooges slapstick, but I find their history interesting. I recently tried to investigate things from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe shorts doesn't look easy. this is the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say the quality issues with Joe shorts are really not Joe's fault, and I suspect this is the case. Joe as an artist is far from the worst thing about this. The thing that makes me worse is in another comment: the attack of the other guys against the third violates the entire comedy team / Stooges ethos. Perhaps Joe's style was regarded by those in control as not really fit - although there were no real camera conflicts between him and the others - and that was their way of working. <br /> <br /> And what are the titles of this and some of the other late-Stooges shorts? Definitely a lack of creativity; was that kind of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market dried up?
