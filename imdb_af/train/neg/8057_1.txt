What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. The editing is trying too hard to look good, and confuses nothing but the viewer while also giving a powerful headache. The plot is stunned and naturally extended from what began as a short (story or movie). The plot makes just under ten minutes of good story, and it's just painfully stretched until it reaches the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They become thinner. Eventually, the plot is so thin that you might miss it, if you don't pay attention, it's hard to do when you watch this movie. The acting is not even impressive. The characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things about this movie is that it was clear that anyone in charge of the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or was about to go (not that I owed him didn't, I couldn't find it either). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit at all. What was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course it was to attract young men, but it was done just as cheaply. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the movie? At any conceivable level? Some Sins? The two desperate guys had nothing to do with the movie, they were just there to have some chase scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a movie that is so poorly crafted and such a shameless and horrible Hollywood-like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea. But I deviated. I recommend it to teenagers with a low attention span who do not have a very bad horror thriller in mind, as long as there is a bit of sex and being overtaken by it (although this may be true for the Killer Cut I saw ). 10/01
