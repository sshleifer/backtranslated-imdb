(NOTE: I thought I'd be the only one who wrote what I did below, but I see the others agree here. It's pretty obvious - it was the bait-the-cat bit. ) <br /> <br /> The owners left for two weeks on vacation - a trip to California - the cat (Sylvester) left alone and locked in the house. It does not mean milk, but the cat, to its relief, finds a lot of canned tuna. But to his dismay he cannot find the opener. <br /> <br /> It seems that the little mouse in the house has it ... and the cat lures it. It is an average rodent who keeps Sylvester opener and then discards the last few seconds. Sylvester tries everything possible to open the tin can, but can't do it. <br /> <br /> It's a frustrating story, and why they make the sadistic mouse, the "good guy" is outside of me. It's like some of the Tom & Jerry cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst, though the little mouse often starts the conflict!
