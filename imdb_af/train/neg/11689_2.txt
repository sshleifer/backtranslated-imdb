I have never seen Spike Lee's previous films, because their trailers never caught my interest. I saw, and admire Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster's work, and have several of their DVDs. However, I was totally disappointed with this movie. If this movie is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to get a job done and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators saw the same movie I saw. I can only assume of their juicy lover's reviews that their worship of Spike Lee made them blind to the banality of this piece of work. I paid just $ 2.50, in a "Second Run" theater, and still felt I was wasting my money. <br /> <br /> The IMDb "Trivia" page says it all ....... <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How to Expect a Big Budget Shoot "Blockbuster" (as the media promised hype), in such a short time? No wonder there was such a poor performance. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard was the first to go to the movie ..." - He may have done this project right, more time to do so naturally. Although the writing was horrific, the premise had some advantages. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I am sorry! This film was so big with pitiful clich√©s, unquestionable scenes, and turbulent characterization that he might not have made much of it. (Hey Ron! Make sure you thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her role in three weeks." - And it showed! Her portrayal of a "Fixer", which made people's problems go away, was as incredible as the writing she gave. Did she even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other fingertips: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would be bothered to get to the door, informing a uniform police officer that inside the bank was robbed, and he would stay away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) arrives in the bank to verify that there are no bodies yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, have led a policeman far less " "a cop back to the front door, so the police officer can walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * That. Frazier later claimed that he "gave the robber every reason to shoot me." Why didn't he even try in the short fight to expose the robber's face? It might have been the answer he was looking for ... a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take Steve, Stevie, Steve-O (the robber's accomplice), so long to help? <br /> <br /> * I understand it wasn't your typical bank robbery. They had a different agenda and didn't want anyone to be harmed. But the police had no reason to think they wouldn't. For them it was a desperate situation. Why then when two of the bad guys walked outside to pick up the pizzas, were they not taken down. (First of all, how many robbers came out without using a hostage as a shield? Is it Spike Lee's version of NY City, or SNL's?). By taking them down, the bad man's numbers would have diminished, their plans screwed, and the remaining robbers would probably give up. If not, there would be at least less bad guys inside. (Give SWAT something to do or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * Which police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just roll into the bank and discuss a case with the robbers, that she would not even make known to them? She had no authority, no government evidence; And besides, it was already a hostage situation ... one more? <br /> <br /> * Why would the bank chief executive (Christopher Plummer) just destroy the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds he could sell. <br /> <br /> * Who was that "schmuck" (the character, not the actor), with the Jersey accent, who was conveniently voluntary and said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian" but still he couldn't speak. SIR! Put your hand down! And his ex-wife! What a "slut" she was !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * When suspects are questioned, why does Det. Frazier, constantly bothering the individuals who, of course, were not part of the heist? (Ie - tell the elderly woman she can go, and then she can't, then it can't?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robberies that hostages had been put in jail, couldn't deduce their escape plan included in the bank as if they were hostages? <br /> <br /> * Towards the end of the film, a fake wall was shown built in the storage room, whereupon Clive Owens hid away for a week .... where did the materials come from? (the plaster and studs). It also had to be assumed that they had cut into the sewer so that he could relieve himself. The bankers haven't complained about the smell all week long? Welcome! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; Since the documents fell "in the hands of the robber", what kind of references have me. White expects to get the lead CEO, as he was now a target for extortion because of her failure? <br /> <br /> And last but certainly not least, what is the "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? HOW TO STOP! Was it supposed to indicate his "solution" to fix these guys? He watched, rather than a man hanging a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Tjeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Unlike the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad acting; and total miserable direction ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />.
