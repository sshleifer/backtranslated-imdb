Joe Don's opening style says it all about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker, an Italian master. Joe Don's character is known as Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this movie is shooting people and is arrested over and over. Everyone in the movie hates him, just as everyone hates Greydon Clark. I had an earlier Greydon picture, "Angel's Revenge" because it was a shirne for older boys. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
