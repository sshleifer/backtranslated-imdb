I don't know why this action was ever tolerated in the movie business! This movie (short) is gross (to say the least)! It is a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pens, acting like adults (and too much!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "the good old days" might not be so good! (Thank you, GOD, we have laws against this kind of material!) <br /> <br /> {This is one short of the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
