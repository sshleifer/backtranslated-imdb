This movie has fatal flaws in how anyone can walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is incredible. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the doctor's office, is just bad writing or bad editing. <br /> <br /> Very much predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was made, except that it was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I must say the person Aaron plays, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television, I will say It will be a while, but otherwise it is a movie that no actor wants on their CV no.
