When I got a look at the title I thought, we're going to get another trial-hard hipster, but I actually found '7eventy 5ive' to be a little wise, and nearly 80's throw back to a boring layer middle section that picks it up. momentum for the last half hour resulting in an excessive, rocky climax and straight cop end. It will not win awards for originality, as it is as systematic as you can get and thunder in the path of excitement (ordinary cheap bounces), place (secluded home) and motivation of other movies steal. The glittering direction is at-the-book and the material is fairly hacked with poorly realized red herring within its extensive plot and flimsy writing. Sometimes ridiculous, yet I am especially entertained because of his brutal and creepy acts of poisonous violence against some rather unpleasant annoying college students by a psychotic assassin with a vicious warrior. The performances were not bad in the form of a brilliant young role, but the characters they portrayed were not particularly seductive. Rutger Hauer always appears in a brief supporting role as a grizzled detective. A slick, but a level and forgetful addition to the fold.
