Okay, I watched this movie twice, I looked it heavily on the net, I asked several people about it. I even went to read the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book based on this movie. I feel the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play while it is being watched. As the plot of the movie doesn't make sense at all, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syria with her father, Mr. The Lafontaine. They continue their life happiness and peace. One day they received a letter from the "General" a man who made his mission alive to avenge his daughter's death. He claims that supernatural forces are at work and explains that he will be visiting them soon. Meanwhile, the Lafontaines leads her daughter, Carmilla, for a few months to meet with a foreign woman. Soon Laura will be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and start off with a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what did she do with Laura's condition and the general? <br /> <br /> I found out this game and want as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name and would also have a jingle, but I can't be bothered with that. It calls the "this movie doesn't make sense" game. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is, while watching the movie, set up a complete plot explaining what's going on. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> This will have to answer such questions as ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk around in the daytime? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl called Bob? And why does she shoot herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it really? <br /> <br /> * Why do killing zombies look like an accepted part of life that doesn't make someone bat an eyelid? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine mock and run a zombie without delaying while driving his car, but when he accepts a woman with a clear hostage in the back of her car that she is also a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And then why let him drive a girl he later reveals that he knows he is the head spider, with him in his car <br /> <br /> * And let her drive, alone with his daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What is hell in the asylum scene? <br /> <br /> What's the hell in the green? Why does the head vampire suddenly start like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why are there never any vampires fighting? Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? what was it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know this? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so much fun to find so many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my plot, and I have to admit it's not quite there, but it's a very good effort. <br /> <br /> In conclusion <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs. Zombies' has no moment in it. is actually Vampires who are fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie looks exactly what is going on, but they seem very reluctant to let the audience in here. And somehow it's based on a classic 19th-century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?
