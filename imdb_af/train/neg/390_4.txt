I loved the apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with season 5? (or is it 6?), things just get tiring. <br /> <br /> I was planning to keep the show, but it becomes Donald Trump's own ego festival. She gives his company what you will work for, but come on! Some of the things say, "You're forbidden" is just insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I wouldn't work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or so. It's just that the show is unrealistic and how it handles things just makes me busy. Good Entertainment? Yeah, but tired, as the back is so tired. It's not teamwork, it's not personal, it's just business. Look at your back jacket.
