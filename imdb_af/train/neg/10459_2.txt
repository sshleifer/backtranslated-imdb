Inappropriate, unclear, bad script, poor photography and direction. All in all, it is of course a bad pregnant first attempt to make commercial films by the good people at TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures had great success in the past by helping bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and much of his programming and who loved "China Cry," I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to everyone. They do very well with their ministry, but this is not an example of this. Don't waste your money ... go rent "China Cry" earlier.
