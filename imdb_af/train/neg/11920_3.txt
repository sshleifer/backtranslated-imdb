Oscar Wilde's comedy of ways, perhaps the finest play ever written, is thrown into the hands of a second time. Sanders, as one would expect, is undoubtedly brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole process a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts to increase stage accent in alternative sentences and the other members of the role play think it is a melodrama and not a comedy; Indeed, the whole production has bookmarks that reduce it to a tragedy - no doubt the Hays office insisted. Preminger's direction seems mostly to make sure there are many servants and even the music looks banal. Stick to the visually perfect quiet farce as indicated by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read the drama for the pleasure of the words. But skip this version.
