In fact, cruel intentions 2 are cruelly intentions 1, again, just done badly. The story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and making me look, I eventually got dirty because it was compared to watching a soft core porn. I'm not sure if some of the idiotic lines should blame the actors or the writers ... and I always feel bad to say this because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basic " a two-hour waste of my life. It literally surprised me that some movies are made, and that is no exception. I can't believe they would make a third.
