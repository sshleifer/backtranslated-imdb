"The Cat's Meow" contains some scenes that boast an intelligent dialogue, and some good performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair and make-up work by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is compelling as author Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (although why movies never use her real stutter, it's hard to explain). But these elements do not add to a successful whole. The scriptwriter worked very hard on some scenes. The meetings between Davies and Chaplin are exceptionally well-crafted - but not as hard on the big picture. Several minor characters do not have to be there and should not be worn constantly. The basic plot is full of illogical (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to hear something he really doesn't want to hear?), And the partytone is repetitive and tiring. I would like to think about a trip on Hearst's hunt was much better than the movie shows. Davies is characterized as a standard sparkling Flapper type, which is not really accurate, and the author's ideas about Chaplin and love are indisputable. <br /> <br /> Oddly, Bogdanovich, who looked like "Paper Moon" in the 1930s, had a similar affinity for the Twenties. He insisted on the excellent costume designer using only black and cream, giving the party guests a very artificial look, and playing only the most stereotypical songs of the era (eg "Yes, We have no Bananas"). When Hearst insists on everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" The actors seem to have had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> The life of silent movie stars can make fascinating movies, but I'm sure, but not this time.
