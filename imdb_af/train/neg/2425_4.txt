# # # Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is this movie offer? Out of control editing and cinematography matching a horrible plot. It's sad to see Denzel wasting Washington's talents in such a garbage. We are certainly shown how the Mexicans cannot save themselves, out of power, possibly militaristic, American people. And we know the father is a shady character, after all, he is a Mexican, unlike the woman who appreciates Creasey because he is American. He killed all of them that she died. And did she? Of course, she won't, she's a young kid and you're not supposed to hurt the Hollywood fan's sensitivity. The finishing touch was the only thing that prevented me from rating it under the "incredibly successful" (as a critic pointed out) "Taken". The nausea of ​​such movies will take time to go. It's in the review of such movies that we have to doubt IMDb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure! Mines will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
