This film is a striking coaching of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the movie shown on IMDb acknowledge the original author, but I did it. don't see it at the beginning of the movie, but a credit at the end of what has said "suggested by Silas Marner's book". Suggested? It was nothing but a complete partition of all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> An aggrieved and sad old man, a craftsman, poor and lonely, stole all his money. One night a child walked to his door while her mother died in the snow outside. The man takes her in and one day demands the local champion (or rich politicians here) to take the child. It was he who had the child in an illegal relationship before. The battle then happens that must have the child's legal custody. <br /> <br /> In this and every aspect of the movie, the story is exactly the same. In only one can I find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps it would be the acting ability of Mr. Martin to crush it. In addition, he dyed his hair in a carrot juice fusion (presumably to make him look younger, but to make him look more like the clown)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this horrible comedian cannot resist bringing in the story that has no part in it and only detracts from the depth of the story. Like when the child cries in the court building that states she can only be happy with the man who has taken her for years. It is transmitted in the film by the girl who uses nasal decongestant on the bridge of her nose to make her tear! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that legal philosophy and integrity within the film industry make such a film possible. If I were a George Eliot trustee, I would claim recovery. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the profits to that estate or to the poor. At least it should be entitled to Silas Marner - adjusted by S Martin. Or better still remove from the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - release it completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation in the 1980s.
