I'm a big fan of Martin Amis, whose book this film is based on. Unfortunately, the director cannot translate the book onto the screen. The novel is thoroughly post-modern and highly artificial in its devastated characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development. It is a hilarious investigation of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary British writers. The director of the film completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands, the film shouts at break speed, which is possible in every well-known trick shot and 'strange' camera angle. It is like Ken Russel on acid, and suffers from the fact that older director's self-esteem turned to one hundred. Not even the (short) look at the beautiful actor Christian Solimeno's penis was enough to save this miserable movie for me. Abysmal!
