Hey, <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to make it about Leonard Cohen! It's full enough Leonard to indignate the spectator who remains to wonder why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them doubtful) talking about themselves. Puleeze .... sounds like they are reviving their diary entries in junior high. Who cares for you, how about Leonard? Guess what people, if you are "doing something" worthy, can make a documentary about you. I particularly insulted the parade of U2's members as if it would add credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard does not need Bono or the Rand for his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody a part of his spirituality through the film. Give, what a concept! I'll give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their coverage of Cohen tunes. The rest of the shows were drilled and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans don't say I didn't warn you!
