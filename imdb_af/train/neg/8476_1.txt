this movie was a terrible excuse for ... a movie. First of all, the decisive could have been better; Katelyn the main character looks nothing like her TV mother. <br /> <br /> The plot was also patedies. it was extremely cliché and predictable. The end was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I will say about it). <br /> <br /> However, the nail in the bag was a scene when Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was crying, but the girl couldn't cry on commando! there were no tears streaming over her face, just a few incredible sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she has the same false layer as that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire (sp?). That's when the movie went off well, but just bad. It really looked like she was acting. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was kind of a mix of every cliché children's movie of the 1990s that everyone is sick of - just worse! <br /> <br /> I give it a 'F' because it was just as difficult to go through (b / w, I was baby sitting when I saw it). <br /> <br /> But you may have it as your 9 or under. ;)
