I bought this movie for $ 5 at a used CD store, and I'm so sorry. I'm starting to say I'm a big fan of cheesy horror flicks. They offer a terrific cheap entertainment. This movie has been entertaining for the first half hour because it was so bad that it could easily be in an MST3K way. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> The acting is the frightening part of the movie. While great acting could not be expected, it was nice and honestly it said all the entertainment that had to be presented. This is the plus of the movie. Where the movie really falls into the reception is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie offers too much "What's the% $ @ # going on?" moments. There are many moments, such as the mother who strangely attends to dinner, and then it has absolutely no effect in the movie. Along the meal, someone in charge decided it was nice to see people eating refined food without dialogue for five minutes every time a meal is served. During the meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts to pure darkness outside. Then cut back in. And if you're talking outside of darkness, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate, where it doesn't seem to be night unless it's raining. And if you're talking about the darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it's so weak that you can't see what happens half the time, which is more frustrating than anything. In one of the climaxes you can't even say what to see, it's so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climactic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I saw people say, "Wow, it surprised me, and that's good." I can say that the big revelation surprised me because I didn't see it. The reason I didn't see it is because it has absolutely no meaning. I will not ruin it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes in different parts of the movie to find something that would actually validate it. And all we found was more things to say it wasn't possible. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is actually better if you see it with the commentary likes of it. I love horror movies, but it was too much.
