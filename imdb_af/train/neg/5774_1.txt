This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this movie. Go on the bus while apparaly anti-racist, do nothing but berate whites and humiliate the black status quo. The plot of this movie is about a group of black men traveling on a bus to Louis Farrakhan's millionaire march. The bus has every type of person you can imagine: gay, muslim, banger and uncle Tom (he is thrown from the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist, the moment he got on the bus to drive. Despite being a Jew and explaining, he eventually became a racist and left the bus. I hate to say that, but movies like this should realize their own hypocrisy and rienforcation of steriotypes. It should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment. You may think I'm a racist to write it, but I mean well. Good luck next time Spike.
