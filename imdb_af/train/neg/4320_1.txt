First of all, let me say that it is not the movie for people looking for something enthusiastic and joyful for the holiday. This movie is cold, brutal, and just straight depressed. Mary Steenburgen plays a virgin mother who falls on Christmas because her husband lost his job, they lost their home, could not buy Christmas gifts for the children. You get the idea, happy things for the holiday. So comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon, the Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long dress comes more like a pedophile who hangs around with children all day. What better way to use the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer to bring them back when she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is an extortionist and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for Nazi refugees on the lamb. The movie is all so thick that you don't mind the happy ending when it comes, because the rest of the movie is so bitter and incredible. I'm sure this movie wanted something Capra, but it left out the joy and sentiment of what a holiday movie should be.
