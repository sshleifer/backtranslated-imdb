This movie was so disappointing. From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called?) I expected something beautiful and thoughtful with beautiful images. It had some interesting images, but it was often random and had no meaning. In fact, they seemed to be inserted to fill in on time. In the end, the effect was listless. <br /> <br /> I believe the movie is meant to be atmospheric, but it just wasn't. The lack of a coherent plot did not help. You might say it's mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character has been disturbed, but the plot did not care enough for me about her situation. Without looking at the list, I wouldn't know you were seeing the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes (there were several) seem senseless and confused me further. I recognized Lulu, but I wasn't sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or her prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits I discovered on the hairy back to belong to her lover. This film managed to make what was shocking (dream series about Lulu's mother). It seems a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The nail file actually made more sense, as it gave an indication of Lulu's emotional state. I won't be guilty of the actors because they didn't have much to work on. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was due to discontent or pretentiousness. but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can't be bothered anymore.
