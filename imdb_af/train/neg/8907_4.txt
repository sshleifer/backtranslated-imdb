I rented it on DVD yesterday and didn't realize it was a kind of character study, so I struggled to watch about an hour before I hit the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with a character study theme, I couldn't get into this movie at all. Perhaps it was my mood to look at something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but I tried my best to continue looking, but got up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination didn't come together to keep me interested. Over the only interesting thing, the sergeant's gun was stolen and he soon rushed to buy another one, and it painted black to appear as a police issue. I think this movie had to be entitled, "who stole the sergeant's gun?" Sites were well done, but to join them, I once again felt it was coherent to look at me. <br /> <br /> As I didn't complete it, I'd say there are some merits to renting this movie. .. can be. For me, it was a waste of good looking effort and time. I'll give it to you to try it, but it's not one I strongly recommend.
