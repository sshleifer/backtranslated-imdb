this movie was terrible. I thought with all the some decent actors, it would be better. Don't waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was terrible. she must stay with desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes a B-actor. the mess he made in the movie, I could never be your wife, was the symbol of what I say. She was cute, but definitely needed more acting. just look like heaven with Reese Witherspoon. It was a little better. or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful not to waste your precious time. PS I love you is also good from outside the grave romance! time to look at movies counted over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it.
