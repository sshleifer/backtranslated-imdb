George Brent is a reporter sent to sustain an heir. She is probably the heir to a facial fortune. He maintained her with her hunt. They fall in bathing suits for each other. <br /> <br /> It seems (very early) that she is not an heir. She is part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the up and down of their romance. <br /> <br /> The supporting casting doesn't do much to buckle it. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Although fairly predictable, it is also quite entertaining. It's far from her best. But especially in the light of his darkness in her oeuvre, it is not one of her worst.
