Drones, ethnic drums, bad synthesizer pipes, children sing. The most enchanting "world music" imaginable. It's a tourist movie, and a common one. What really kills is the incoherent rows. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. No transitions, no visual explanation of why we suddenly left ten thousand miles, no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of footage from third-world people with "baskets on their heads" as another reviewer said. Walk around endlessly as if it has some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video, they had to kick off just a few hundred miles south of the head where the best parts of Koya were shot, and film in Mexico. It would have been a much better environment for life in transformation. <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided on was an irrigated tourist project covering half of the world and sensible leftovers. The only thing to recommend this movie is that it doesn't suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
