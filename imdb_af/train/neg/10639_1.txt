Unthinkable, ignorant, poor understanding, career kill (where is the talented Angela Jones now?), Deep barren garbage. It's no wonder that Reb Braddock has done something else - someone who has a chance to make his first film on his own, based on his own script, using Quentin Tarantino himself, and creating something like this, anyone who feels it was a story to tell the world doesn't deserve a second break. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told to do, and they do it well. It's just that they didn't do it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
