Kurosawa really did blow it on this one. Each genius is allowed a failure. The concept is good, but the performance is poorly faded. <br /> <br /> There is a fantasy flight over this movie that makes it an art movie. The poverty of Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic depiction. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing movie.
