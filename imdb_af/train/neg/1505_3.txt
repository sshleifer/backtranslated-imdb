A bit ordinary, trashy Italo-Western, stupid story full of claws and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty institutions, many battles and people are killing on a massive scale. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translation, this German DVD edition is called "Adios Companeros", and fought Macho Callaghan against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed his one (he is the only survivor). Then you fight Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because they dispute and divide the gang. And you've fought Ironhead against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway. Yes, this is it, no more cunning in the storyline, hehe. <br /> <br /> A small role by Klaus Kinski and Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene he seeks to separate two men who fight by hitting and shouting: "I have said love!" And in another scene, he is winning a competition to throw a horse cover and throw it for a second. It's fantastic! <br /> <br /> It's also remarkable that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinematography - I love this master of incompetent exploitation thrash, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
