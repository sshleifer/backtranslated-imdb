Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, both thought, it had to get better, these actresses were too good to waste their time on this shit. Unattractive characters, chopped scripts and pompous pacing make for a long two hours. I couldn't really hack it and be left to do the groceries (cat litter is more appealing than this movie). The man stayed and confirmed that it had not improved. By the time Buddy is murdered, you all want to be hit by a car and end their unhappy lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep this one alive.
