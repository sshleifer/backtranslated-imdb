If you like to be entertained, this movie won't be watching. If you like to see heroic forces of war, this movie won't see. If you would like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay, this movie will not be seen. If you like typical Hollywood war movies ending just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of the war, IT GOES MOVIE. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless characteristics of the war. This movie shows a bunch of guys walking around the countryside saying terrible clich√©s, doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same exact power and brutality given to the oppressed. This film is a disgrace to filming and the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and seeing it, is told that this is how Americans really are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please don't waste your time on this piece of junk. if you have to, wait and rent it. 10/04
