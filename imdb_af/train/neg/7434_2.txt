If it is based on the life ratio, as claimed, between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I'm excited that I don't know them personally. It is painfully slow, and both characters take dull pills throughout the film while the theme song is played in the ground. Many stupid scenes with people who are stupid do not make a comedy.
