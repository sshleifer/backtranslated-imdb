Los Control is another offer in the erotic thriller genre that can be regarded as the pulp fiction of the movie world. Usually, they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent, collapsed with great disillusionment. This is not a complaint, especially when done by the beautifully beautiful women who always practice this wonderful world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers from a writer's block. Just by chance (or is it?) She meets a guy (Doug Jeffery) who engages in increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim refuses to stop the case. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott), thinks it will do wonders for her book sales. As in most movies of this type, the unbundling comes close to the end, but some do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of movie to think, no change there, then - but I like it. They are so rude. <br /> <br /> Performances of the role play vary. Doug Jeffery carries the film as the soul / sociopat that you don't want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince if the woman is in danger. Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Lastly, a warning from the DVD under review. Both the cover and disk status R-rated and running time than 93 minutes, but the run-in time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scene is being cut and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is cut short as she is doing. 4 stars.
