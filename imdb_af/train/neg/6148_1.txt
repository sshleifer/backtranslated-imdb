First, the movie was not true at all. I saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie was nothing like it. First, Nash was a genius in math and that's what the movie is about, not a story about a man who has been healed and who eventually found love. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong - the scene where he was riding a bike on campus did not follow in his early years. In my opinion, Russell Crowe didn't fit this part at all, as he didn't seem to be the intelligent / individualistic type, so he really couldn't play one. It would be great if it were more focused on math (similar to Pi) and not the overly dramatic love. At this level, ABM was hollywood-ish and too superficial to be good. Personally, I think he wasn't angry or paranoid and he was on something because people of that caliber tend to know more than we are less mortals. 10/05
