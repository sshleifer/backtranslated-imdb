There is little to get excited about "Then in real life". First of all, the whole setup is incredibly customized. Did you really believe that Marie would not have told Dan what she was going to during that very first meeting? And since then all the talks played during the conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? For the case I never figured out why Marie was so dressed in Dan in the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is really a good guy (he is, for example, Marie in the bookshop, insults his brother about his past friends and tries to make Marie jealous of a blind date). There is more contrivance like that ridiculous scene at the building line where Dan and Marie are caught all over the family. Yes, it can really happen. Then in real life is slow, juicy and manipulative. Even chick flicks like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher points than this predictable "tearjerker".
