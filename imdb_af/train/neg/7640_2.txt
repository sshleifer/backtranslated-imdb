I basically saw Eden's curve as a very poor building that made it difficult to watch. However, there is something I should say about how the director addressed something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in choosing institutions and clothing. The "back to earth" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that were not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70s, were right, as the "ask, don't tell" pseudo-liberalism from the fraternity that existed from east coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought it was more likely from a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I think the "ole boy" mentality still has elite schools like this dominated. a. Another thing I appreciated and that may be is that it was a time when homosexuality was not so much linked to teachers or drag queens, and I have some homosexual roles that are not related to these terribly common images , do not appreciate. I felt that it was a pity that 'gay culture' was adopted from Castro and Christopherstrate in certain standard forms in the 80s and defined the movement and poured out large numbers of gay men who were more subdued in their lifestyle. I really appreciated the movie as a way to remember a more natural way about our sexuality and personal relationships without the scene.
