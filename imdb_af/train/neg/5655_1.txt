The Egyptian movies have many movies with a high level of drama or novels or comedy or action even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lamb" was banned in Egypt because it is content nudity (Volfront Female Nudity) and this kind of nudity is banned in Egyptian films. When I saw these movies, I felt ... Fool Story .. Naked actress .. Bad action. Some horror and horrible colors .. Dear friend. If you want to see a wonderful Egyptian movie ... Simple: Stay away Form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lamb". We have good movies in Egypt ... We have great actors who won a worldwide victory such as: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb. We have great directors like "Yousef Shahin", so believe me. You don't have to watch this movie.
