I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. When it was bombed at the box office, it was repeated on HBO for about a month. And I watched it over and over because television in general was so bad - or was at the time. I'm not watching anymore, so it can be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says of piglets: "It might taste good potato tart, but I'll never know, because I won't eat the dirty meal." Let's look. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out after Bryan's life, so you can guess where the inspiration comes from. The few lightly funny legs go too long until you just close your eyes and tart your teeth. There is one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, they both dragged and dried, killing thirst. Then they meet like old acquaintances who don't really know each other well, promise to do lunch. It might have been funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most clearly is meeting Pharaoh, in which Pharaoh is a black street child acting in full King Tut regalia. He had to read the lines straight, because at one stage before the release, he presented his play with the Hollywood equivalent of Black Street Lingo, voiced by a Jimmy Walker Wannabe (Kid Dyno-Wannabe). Or it could have been Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They managed to change a really boring scene into a very racist, very intact, very long tail, one of those legendary things that just won't flush, no matter how many times you try, so you get it there let someone else deal with. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY, WHAT YOU DO!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of Tequila and a six pack of Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that they've rebuilt the Poseiden Adventure, it's one is probably high on the remakes list. Maybe this time they will hire a comedy writer.
