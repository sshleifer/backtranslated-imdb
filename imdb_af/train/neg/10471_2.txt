Quite frankly, the Omega code is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. During the first 30 minutes I sat in my seat and tried to decide if I should claim a refund. But since I didn't pay to see it in the first place, I thought I could just stay that way. And I didn't think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> It did. I'll quickly run through the low points (including some spoilers): The terrible mistake of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. The characterization was inconsistent; For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit. Then there is the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies; We see a lot of sensational news soundtracks, accompanied by ridiculous computer expressions of the translated Biblical code. Also, horrible "action" directions: Lane escapes from difficult situations without explanation, and once Lane actually seems in danger, it seems to be a dream order! It's great for grammar school assignments, but it's an unbeatable plot device in a movie. The pacing was bad: after a long opener, the first third of the movie changed every 90 seconds. Later the pacing is improved, but there are still too many unnecessary jumps around. And as someone else has mentioned, none of them (not even Lane's young daughter) are running for years. It was disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good things. The quality of the film (eg lack of grain) is high and very attractive. The outdoor shots were well done and the shooting area added a touch of realism. There are also a few moments in the last part of the movie when Lane finally calls on God to help him - it was quite exciting - even to me someone who did not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I enjoyed it because it became the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, this is followed by great incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> The characters, dialogue, direction and acting were ALL badly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just strange. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot were firmer and more focused, and the characterization had fallen out, the movie would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the Omega code disappears. Definitely not paying to see it. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
