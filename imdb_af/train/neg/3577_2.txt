This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a well-known Harold Robbins formula: ambitious main characters in decades while following the road to the top of a randomly chosen but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. But in spite of being so formal to be completely predictable, at the same time, this movie runs completely unbelievably. Zadora (to call her inexperienced actress must be charity) never convinces as a scriptwriter. One could expect a movie about movies to have insight into his own industry and creative process. But the writing gives her nothing of the attributes that authors make interesting movie characters: observation, skill with words, a love affair with own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here. The cinematography is so dark that it is sometimes difficult to see what is going on. And the screens never really work together, so it looks like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
