Why do filmmakers always go against the writer's work? I mean, yes, things need to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest, but look at Anne or Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a coherent whole, which was simply delightful. I can't believe they have chosen to add three novels to Anne of Avonlea in such a terrible mess. Look at everything they missed by doing so. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne's college years, for heaven's sake !!! Wouldn't it be nice to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan had to take things one movie at a time, instead of messing them all together and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good if you leave the novels out! But L. Montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied. This movie was a bit of a successful way of life by Anne from Green Gables.
