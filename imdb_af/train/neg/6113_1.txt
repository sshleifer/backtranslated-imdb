I shouted my head because I was going to see the first movie that was ever 13 months old. I remember it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched it again on TV a few years ago. Big mistake - the play is wood, the plot does not exist and the movie has no merit unless 23-year-old T & A is what you are going ... 0 / ****
