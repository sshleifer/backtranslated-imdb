Make no bones about it. There are many things wrong with this movie. It is completely cliché, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: characters. There is the boring, happy guy who still gives Stiller a notch in his boring, happy mango part. The allegedly wild, but in fact, only fairly normal, loving - who plays Aniston well, but doesn't really need to do it - the fat, jovial friend, and then the clichés: an annoyingly brave Australian man, a confident Spanish man, etc. The storyline: The beginning is a bit unusual, but then goes into the standard-style movie style, with each plot as predictable as your average knock-knock joke. The biggest problem was that Stiller's character's "development" really came from nothing - like your average school game, the writers knew where he started and where he ended, but didn't have enough stock in the right way of the put it in the middle. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing more than highly watered-down versions of standard, outrageous humor; There was a regulation of a lot of scene, sweet men, etc. <br /> <br /> Finally, the simple fact of this movie is that learning the meaning of the word "shart" was the only good thing. Hamburg really set up a dog meal here, and the sugar cover of Stiller and Aniston lured the viewers, but the taste left was just as whacky. <br /> <br /> Final remark: This movie may have been terrible, but Aniston still chose a better inter-friends season movie than Kudrow's excited "Marci X."
