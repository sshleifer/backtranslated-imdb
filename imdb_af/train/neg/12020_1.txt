It was such a waste of time. Danger: If you see it, you will be asked to tear your DVD out of the wall and pull it through the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur production: terrible, repetitive, turbulent dialogue; paper thin plot line; wood performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hacked. <br /> <br /> Serious erroneous story, totally amazing characters. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. is: (1) the evil twins, (2) memory loss. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The plot "turns"? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like seeing a train in the middle of the day on the prairies. It's not even right. The evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please - don't look at it, even if it's free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue.
