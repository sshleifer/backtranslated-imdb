Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Characters with no personality are then developed. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning and no means. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are not beautiful because they are not even allowed, because this movie is not even there. There is no "is" in this movie because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There's a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is so and the movie is so good that it's not even worth watching, so if you're really interested, I suggest you buy the soundtrack or something. You get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headache and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
