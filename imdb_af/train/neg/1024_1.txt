I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival with pretty good expectations. the movie has a good role and was then at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when the film's director talked to the movie about directing an episode of wiseguy, he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director / author of wiseguy which makes his feature debut = blah). Well, Edison's director / writer should have some incriminating photos of Kevin Spacey killing a homeless man, because I can't see how he (along with the other film players) will ever vote to be in it disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely horrible! This is a mix of every cop hard-boiled clich√© ever. there is nothing with Edison. The acting was bad and the direction was even worse. It looks like the former episode of wiseguy. It was best thrown directly to the video movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> some examples of just bad moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music ... justin timberlake gets creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj drives a vintage firebird ... 3 guys are shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> Stay away from EDISON!
