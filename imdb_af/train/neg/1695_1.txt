OK when I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked very scary and was very excited to see it as the group I was with. Now in America especially during this election, I see some very deceptive things, but I have to say that these previews were at the top of the list. I don't see how many people can be scared by this movie. I only noticed two real jump scenes and just jumped one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe it messed me up with some of the jump scenes. As far as the sound effects are concerned, so much is so scared that I thought they were at their best comic. Oh, and the uh kitten, where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird sigh. How does it scare someone? I can make it easy. Don't get me wrong. I've always loved all the very bad scary movies that just laughed at you, but I didn't even think this one went for it, but it was just bad.
