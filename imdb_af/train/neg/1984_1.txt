An absolute steaming heap of cow manure. It is my thought that this film has even been made. Hip-Hop and Old Westerns just don't seem to mix. Which target audience thought these people were planning this train wreck. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the play is horrible and the fact that some decent actors even in this nightmare of a movie make their entire careers a stockpile. The chick of clueless should never be forgiven, and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue, she had asked which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research I actually found a list of other actors who passed this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I'd rather watch an empty TV than see this movie again.
