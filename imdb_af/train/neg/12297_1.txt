Witchy Hildegard Knef captures a group of people in a secluded hotel and takes them one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. I thought I saw everything until one unhappy man was crucified here and then set his head on fire. Hildy is also the prankster: she takes a crispy harp and sticks her mouth ... and just hangs her down in the chimney just for a roaring fire! "Witchery" made me sick. It hurt my eyes. I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever made by other competent people ... to the final. I must admit that I loved the end. It includes a boy and his toy tape recorder, which is opposed by Linda Blair, who had a fantastic possession. The scene only lasts about a minute and the movie is over, but you know the guy says, "If you have a good ending, people will just forgive you about anything!"
