It is just flat out of fit. If there's a story somewhere here, it's buried so deeply under the awful characters and the mutilated camera works that's unthinkable. There are a group of vampire hunters doing their thing and the vampires that kill them have little strangers inside them. They push their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can think of a blood and gore-covered alien sock that screams in horror as a cowboy dude with a beef juice, this is what you get here. These people are hard, unpleasant, violent and just extremely irritating. Then there are some anti-human people standing in their CGI spaceship, so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton compared to a right-wing extremist. They are friends with some vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there's the camera working. Remember, how did everyone hate the thousand-cut-a-minute crap from the recent Rolleball remake? The people who made this movie love those things. There is plenty for three really crappy nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
