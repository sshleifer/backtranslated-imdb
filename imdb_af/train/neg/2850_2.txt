If I realized John Wayne was in this movie, I wouldn't have watched it. It detracts from the Japanese, unfortunately for Hollywood and embarrassment to any thinker. But then most John Wayne movies are like that. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was a little different. The film deals with the nineteenth-century isolation of Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood to be isolated. To put it as concise as possible, this movie is a terrifying jingoist slap. (Kind of Madama butterfly with bad music.)
