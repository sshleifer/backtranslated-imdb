Oh, I heard so much about this movie. Gone to see it with my best friend (she's a woman, I'm male). Please give me a diverse opinion of the mainstream. After the first few decades "pull out your clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of clumsiness and boredom. We laughed (not with it), we killed (and would have been better to stay in bed), we were convinced that we spent money in vain. And we had. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This movie doesn't even earn one in ten votes, but it's the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has the reputation of being excellent; I do not recommend it to anyone who even has a taste or intelligence.
