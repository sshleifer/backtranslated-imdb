What are they going to do now? <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> The movie looks like it's a combination of the play, the indie movie and the theater. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of things that actors love - it's kind of like a workshop or a play, because it mainly consists of a sharp focus on the actors acting ... what angry, tense, scared, twilight, planning - gives the artists a very free range to really burn it. <br /> <br /> A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, comes up with a big hoist scheme. .. And a monkey key is thrown into the works. To pick up the best stuff, there's a bit of a "fender bender" and one of the crooks is folded through the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> Police are on their tail and they stumble into a bar called poetic (and leadenly) "Dino's Last Chance." <br /> <br /> As a director, Spacey tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and the delivery of dialects. He turns to a bright passion-red cigarette advertisement of a smoky and smoldering Bogart. And he really keeps all the violence on the screen. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie a little edge. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it is moving too slowly and losing weight in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") look too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems to be a brand new tag with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine malicious mad dog police lieutenant, but he gets nothing to really do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to waste blood. <br /> <br /> And the crooks are in a tense situation where they also go to jail or they are trying to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Spacey has the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters mostly kick off, try to think of a plan ... and calm down and articulate them. There is even a scene where the crooks play pool with a whole swarm of armed police right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even calls the police right outside the bar. O brother. Oh, bother. <br /> <br /> This police will either blow them up or shut them down. Don't you have to be scared of the tidy crooks, a little uncomfortable? Meanwhile, all the right action inside. <br /> <br /> Someone swears a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation outside the screen and there's another accident that's happening, it's ... well, kinda sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway also had to spend more time with a dialect coach who improved on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> A policeman reaching the pack for the toughest time is a nice appearance. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear window. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dialogues try to use a David Mamet approach, which is so unholy, but never so realistic or informative. <br /> <br /> The movie feels too much of what it really is ... a very low-budget film with an actor behind the camera for the first time to direct other actors into a script that doesn't bad, but have to write a few more. Spacey shows he is not a terrible director, but he does not have a kind of feeling for a movie and it feels like he is just acting. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and can work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie is really suffering from miscasting. <br /> <br /> I don't mean the wrong actors were thrown. I think they just found the right throw, but put them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would have helped incredibly well. <br /> <br /> After veteran musician actor Joe Mantagna plays the pack of Gary Sinese, the evil police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking his troops, Fischter holds his "bloodthirsty goon" share and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. It would have been a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors work live, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But much of the time, when actors are live, they tend to focus only on performances. Just shoot the actors acting. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase. An excuse for that. <br /> <br /> Hostage situations are all the same as in real life, just like age stories, so it is only natural that movies go over them from point A to point B. <br /> <br /> There are some very good entries in this genre. "Spacey himself appeared in a similar film about hostage situations:" The Negotiator. " <br /> <br /> It will definitely not be a cult class, let alone one of AFI's 100. Yet it has some nice moments and personal touch, but in the end it is immediately forgotten and the kind of movie that will play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other director credit, "Beyond The Sea" was reportedly a better bet. Hmmm ... maybe that's true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
