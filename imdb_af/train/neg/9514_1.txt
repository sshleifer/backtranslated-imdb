Please, save me from these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Couple with a loose writing with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or Coen brother, plus the lives of yet another group of people who supposedly portray high school students from their Dawson Creek brand's teenage anxiety with a GenXYZ soundtrack trying to make the movie cool, we have intense and painful indifferent satire. <br /> <br /> It's not even a "Ferris Bueller" water ... I'd rather see a traffic light change. <br /> <br /> Only one scene is at some point near the prize: the Betty Masked girls meet a Richard Nixon Masked friend. This is a surreal moment. Priceless, even. <br /> <br /> But for the rest, I'd rather have toothache. At least I can apply some Benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
