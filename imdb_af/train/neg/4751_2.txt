First, when I saw the Wendy Wu fan, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel, will do martial arts and it was good with me ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly built, the movie could not have been for anyone, the fight was unrealistic and it sucked ... along with the plot. If you really think it is a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl descended from other warrior women. A girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become a roommate queen. The keeper who tries to prepare her for a big fight against some old evil. The idea was just not as original, the movie was wasting time.
