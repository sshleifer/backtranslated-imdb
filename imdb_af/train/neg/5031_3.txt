The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update of the darker, less child-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for the 1960s. Of course, Gamera is a gigantic, flying, flaming tortoise that literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but mostly similar in most respects. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and recreated by the infamous Sandy Frank. And just like the American version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), Gammera gets the Invincible more than just the spelling. The American screens are not as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the Gojira, but also do not add much to the story, as there is little follow-up on them. <br /> <br /> The movie is promising, there are a few scenes of character development, and there are enough personalities to create excitement outside the main plot. However, as soon as Gamera appeared, the movie started in a tough queue. <br /> <br /> The play is good enough - even the US add-ons are OK. Directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects aren't bad for their time (all screens). Some of the sets and backgrounds are really good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest problem here is that there's nothing too original about this movie. However, Gamera is developing a much more unique personality in its later films - most of which are worth checking out if you are a Kaiju fan.
