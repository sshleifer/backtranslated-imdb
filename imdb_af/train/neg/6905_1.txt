The clich√©d Polynesian males drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and unpredictable remarks. The actual Polynesians are much stranger than this stereotype, cardboard characters. The so-called Samoan girl didn't look at Samoan at all. It looks more like the stock of white woman who has sex with anyone. With weak as watercolor lines, you can't say anything about the play - even the most brilliant actors can't do anything with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a movie with no good scene, and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money, which is a lost opportunity to make a good movie about a lively community. It is better not to make movies if they are so bad and unthinkable.
