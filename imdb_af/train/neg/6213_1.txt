This movie made it into one of my top 10 most horrible movies. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There was no continuous minute where there was no battle with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I didn't have an emotional attachment (except the big bad machine they wanted to destroy) <br /> <br /> Screens were stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Father. <br /> <br /> The spinmaker in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spin in Return of the Kings. (Elia Wood is the victim in both films) and waits ...... it hypnotises (stings) his victim and turns them on ..... oh, hello ???? <br /> <br /> And the whole machine against the human theme was the matrix or the terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste the time? And will anyone tell me what was with the Nazis?!?! Nazi's ???? <br /> <br /> There was a young storyline that rushed to a youthful conclusion. The movie could not decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult movie and was not much. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.
