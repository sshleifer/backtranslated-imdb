Look at Kroko. I would love to leave the theater for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development eg. Kroko, the metaphorical German problem child, remains a pure metaphor without any ability to engage positively, despite several sudden possibilities to do so. Unwritten actors, non-evolving plot. I think the movie was trying to do an environmental recording but didn't succeed: the camera was shaky rather than motivated. Photos were low - contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure deliberately, but the components didn't add to a convincing impression of the social environment. However, the story had some potential, but it could have made a good short story.
