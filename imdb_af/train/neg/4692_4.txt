When I first saw this movie, it was TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of a double feature. Glenn Ford, a weapons expert, is urged to defuse a hidden bomb on a high explosive train. The tension is slow and steady; and this black-and-white movie runs just over an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on TV; the tension and drama lost most of its impact. It's still a good movie as far as the early 50's goes. <br /> <br /> Together with Ford is Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
