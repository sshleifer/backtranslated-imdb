I love a good, sweet love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented 'Love Story', I prayed that the end would come as fast and painless as possible, and just the opposite for Ali McGraw's character. <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny alienates and irritates me from the pain within the first 15 minutes. When we learn that she's been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I can't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss to poor Oliver or if someone watching this movie would even care. If she did not kill her lattice personality, it would probably have Oliver thrown over the edge and eventually landed in divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70's.
