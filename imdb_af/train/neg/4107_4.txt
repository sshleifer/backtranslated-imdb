The problem with "The Killer Elite" is just to find out this movie, and to spend time watching it, you make more effort in the experience than many of its heads did, especially director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> The already volatile Peckinpah was heading for rough weather with this movie. According to at least one biographer, it was where he got acquainted with cocaine. Add to that his binge drink, and it is no wonder things fall apart. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the concept behind the movie is a good one, and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, live well and look like the best friends - then something happens to their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene shows they are blowing up a building - why exactly we're not told, par for the course in terms of this movie's dark motivation. But the implication is that these guys have hurt people and don't really care - antiheroes, like the Peckinpa Wild Forest, not so long ago. An opening story tells us they work for ComTeg, then add a clear tongue to the cheek. "The idea that the CIA can use such an organization for any purpose is, of course, ominous." It's a pretty clever way to let the audience know that all bets are known. <br /> <br /> Add a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the prime role of a Madman who can't get an opportunity to be shot for $ 500 a day, and you just want the writers, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, to try to do something more with the story than to make it into a platform for lazy one-lines and bad cuddles. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social commentary is uncomfortable shoe hearing. "You're so busy doing their dirty work, you can't tell who the bad guys are," someone Locken tells as if he or she needed it. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, Peckinpah's clumsy direction and slow pacing. We are 40 minutes in the film before we get our first battlefield, a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a lot of people we haven't even met at the San Francisco Airport, with a conversation in " a conversation in an office suite. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, there is another battle in the fleet of a Navy Ships fleet, ninjas running in the shore, while the Caan throws one linen hint suppress true tension. "Lie to me seven to five, I'll take the little guy," he jokes just before a climate-samurai game between two Ninja fighters - from China, which we all know, is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties come to break things up.) Caan is much better in smaller scenes, such as when Locken, who recovers some nasty injuries, played by one of his bosses. by a smooth Arthur Hill, that he is "Humpty-dumped" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay, and his recovery screens, although momentary murder for the movie, is fine by him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supporting nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s, and his laconic addiction with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and both Youngs gives Killer Elite a real viewability. <br /> <br /> But you're not looking at "Killer Elite". think of it. You watch it think of the movie that got away.
