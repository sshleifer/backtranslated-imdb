I can't believe those who praise this movie don't think of another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that it would be terrible, but made the writing (or lack thereof) for a movie that was also meaningless. On the positive side, the overall level of craftsmanship of the actors and the technical staff is properly qualified, but if you have a saw to work with you, you can't make a wallet. Ben G fans should stick to just about any other movie he was in. Dorothy S fans must stay with Galaxina. Peter B fans must be at Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laugh at the expense of those who seem to ask it, to stay with Peter B's incredibly horrible book, killing the unicorn.
