Another fine effort by America's most UNDERrated filmmaker. His knowledge of racism is STAGGERING, and IMPRESSES me on more than one level. Accusations that Lee is just a devastatingly small racist, a poisonous dwarf that uses Hollywood's affirmative action system opportunistically to make inferior quality movies, is absolutely NONSENSE, just Right Wing propaganda. The only idea that Lee would resort to abusing the current climate of political correctness in America in order to produce hate-filled anti-white movies is simply FALSE and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's opponents even go so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African Americans as they lay down other races: of course, another FALSEHOD is being distributed by people who oppose peaceful society between different races. America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in The movie is a long dialogue between the rich black Republican and the other in the bus. The opinions presented by the man are simply wrong - across the board. 100% DRIVE. He is teaching LAKS, unlike the brilliantly informed parents who throw him VERY EXCELLENT. <br /> <br /> GREAT performances, and an INTELLIGENT script make a viewing experience that RARELY is competitive with any political films ever made. <br /> <br /> I also want to point out the unceasing LIES that the Million Man March only had 80,000 people on! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do, take, take the antonyms of all the words in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So, what message does Lee send here? If someone doesn't agree with your political views, just use force and throw him off the bus. I thought the movie said, "Get on the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently Mr. Lee for bus segregation, it's nothing but the CCK lunatics in front of him: the bus is only for those blacks that are in line with the Democratic Party's mindset. So much for the "release of the slaves" ... <br /> <br /> The end credits: "This movie has been financed entirely by black people." And distributed and marketed by a great Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites, despising Farrakhan ...
