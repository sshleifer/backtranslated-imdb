Well, basically, the movie is blowing! That's Blair Witch meets Sean Penn's bad imaginary fantasy to go to Iraq to show the world what the "War on Terror" is really about. The script sounds as if it was written by 8th degree (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors overwork the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film (not that I know anything about those things - but it didn't just look like real documentaries) and the worst of all Christian Johnson took a good idea it sucks. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and finally challenged a very bad stick figure that looked like a giant. I'd rather look at Blair Witch VIII than to put it through again.
