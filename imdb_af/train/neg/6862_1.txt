This superior inferiority to the original stupid "Blind Dead" movie is another rubbish bin. So many people have filmed these films that I can't believe what they say about them. Since I was a kid, I have heard how scary and wonderful these movies are and I have seen them all and been disappointed. Were all on drugs, from the 1970s or did they just not know how boring this rough is?
