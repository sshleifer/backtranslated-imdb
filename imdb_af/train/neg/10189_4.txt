I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed ... but then I was only 12 years old. I recently looked at it again and wanted to have that time back. This movie is pretty bad. While I love Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace, (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to see a GOOD movie he was in ... of Meatballs (also Bill Murray's lead), for some laughs, and Burgess Meredith , do this role / did nothing for their careers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is a former car driver who plans to drive his racing car (which he had in store) across the country to California. One problem: Government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was OK (not the worst I heard), but the performance failed terribly.
