Need ridiculous movie version the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is captain Ahab, who falls in love with pastor daughter Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for me. Bennett's love. When Mr. Barrymore lost his leg in a whale accident, Bennett rejected. He must kill the whale and win back Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that can thrash 1930s theater audiences; especially the screens where Barrymore loses his leg. However, the film did not age well; There are much better films from the time, both 1920s and 1930s. The two name attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett, are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
