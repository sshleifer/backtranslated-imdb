If I were to create a film thermometer, this movie would be absolutely zero. Out of ten stars, I'll rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Plot: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's like high school students came together with a camera one afternoon, compiled a plot and shot a movie. It is so lacking in any artistic value that I would rather watch children walking around at a high school than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> However, something needs to be said for the abysmal depths. The "shootout" in the staircase is one of the most train-wrecked funny scenes ever. First, the fighters simply move plastic guns against each other, their arms back and forth to simulate their setbacks. The pair actually "duck" each other's non-existent bullets. No syringes, no sparks, no spaces, but only spit bladder injection molding around. If you want to see two grown men playing an actor, you must give it a go. After cleaning the fridge, the mat combed, polished all the doorknobs, ran the gravel, placed the books on the shelf, and so on. .
