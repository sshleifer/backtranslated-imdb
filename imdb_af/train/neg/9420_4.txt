Follow up to 1973's far better "Cleopatra Jones", static black actress Tamara Dobson returned to her signature role as a chic, super-hard drug agent. Here is a heroin ring burst in Hong Kong. Cross-pollination of bladder operation action movie and kung-fu B movie is initially fun but ultimately flags. The shoot-out finale is straight from the constituent line, and Dobson looks less energetic than before (she is still sexy, and she puts a unique twist on her comically-styled dialogue, but this environment may too much of One thing for her - she's proud). Stella Stevens this time plays the villain; she is good, but can't match the predecessor with Shelley Winters. ** of ****
