My wife and I are half-amused by Howie Mandel's performance. I also like Shatner - even when he's in his most pathetic way. <br /> <br /> But it's absolutely the worst show on television. <br /> Please cancel this view. It sucks a **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothes than Deal or No Deal ... <br /> <br /> The questions is a mixture of way too easy and incredibly dark. And if Shatner is watching the competitor say, "Show me the money," I will vomit it. <br /> <br /> This one won't last.
