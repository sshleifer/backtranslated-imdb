I bought one of those "Legacy of Horror" 50 movie package collections and you would think I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you find a pleasant but champion one like the devil's messenger or the devil's bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock movies (some are not horror, however, because Hitchcock regulates some horrors and tensions), but others Sometimes it looks like they are making movies like The Island Monster and because they do not accept the fact that they will be easily forgotten and that it should be for the case. <br /> <br /> So we open up a Westing game idea. The rich but brutal and abusive father played by Carradine has died and left his legacy to his children and servants he still hates. Carradine gives a good performance as always, but he stays largely in a voice recording and flashback sequence that we leave to go through the mediocre / horrible actions. The rest of the wheelchair either falls over into the screens. Given this was an independent movie of the 70's, the lighting and effects were fairly limited. It is difficult to build a lot of tension when the viewer cannot see what happens so well in some scenes. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga at least make an effort and I am ashamed to admit that I have left me, mostly for the mere stupidity, but still with some very little luck that they are a turning from a bend to another is pretty obvious, but it's not enough to improve the quality of the movie. You are not meant to keep the characters as they are selfish or cruel or psychotic, but it takes it on a whole new level and makes it very unshakable. The dead scenes are pretty bad and the tension isn't really there. It proves that you will probably enjoy the 20 movie package "Chilling" which will include movies like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop or horror with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. This is best avoided.
