I saw a lot of movies in my life, but not very badly. It's a movie that makes people fat, has no real story, has bad actors, is not funny and much more. Is this a movie you'd like to see? I don't think so! <br /> <br /> I think the creators of the movie have been trying to be original and creative, but it seems like a 12-year-old child, with absolutely no movie skills. The so-called funny parts are as funny as door pastes in the faces of people, or windbreaks. From cource if it's the kind of humor you want, then it's the movie for you !! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie!
