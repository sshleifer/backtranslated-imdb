This merged piece of faecal matter adds so many ridiculous scenarios that it is ultimately a low riot of absolute hilarity. Bad because the premise is promising (as is often the case in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter it is in la la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving time for a DUI who killed his mistress. We see that he has nightmares, just so we know he really feels VERY about this. Then he hangs himself to his mate. Or does he? Lowe has some suspicions, but lets them fall quickly. His suspicions are so poor that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why do they kill him? Oh, that's where this story can get interesting. This is where it falls off the rails, and as soon as it comes out of the rails, it can get away with insulting the visitor's attention for the next tribulation. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* ** <br /> <br /> I will not bear endless story of the irrationality of what follows, but consider this end. Lowe is trapped by the bad guys on a train. They want a band that he has because the band will screw their boss and they. So on the train came 3 police, guns pulled, ready to save Lowe. The bad guys killed the police, half of the passengers and then .... continued with Lowe to get the band. HELLO !!!! 3 kill men in public, will get you deep in death, to hell with the band. Yet they go through a shopping center on the spot, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and finally Lowe is grabbed and the bad man still wants the band !!!
