How this piece of garbage is put is beyond me. The only actor known to me is Judge Reinhold, a perfect actor whose presence is merely a justification for bringing it into production. <br /> <br /> I don't even think it's worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this movie really makes B movies a cinematic pleasure. A car driving the police on the highway, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes right. <br /> <br /> The font must be written on the back of a cigar card. Most made for TV movies is terrible, but it does redefine the word. Look at the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar material.
