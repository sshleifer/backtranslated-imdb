If you are looking for abuse or amusement or both, you will probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP is really not even a lot of thoughts, except to repeat the usual stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode, I felt a bit embarrassed that I was actually sitting through the confronted mess. <br /> <br /> Beyond the thin, fuzzy, irregular point of departure, it all attracted the initial attention. First of all, it's just another cripple, harmless and anti-septic effort to comment and entertain that the CBC typically produces. And once the "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" Hype welcomes its welcome, the show will probably follow in the eater of cancellation, as it is so shallow when judged only on its merits. Unless you are obsessed with the Muslim culture in the west and / or are easily amused by most minutes idiosyncrasies on the subject. I really don't see how LMOTP is pleasing if it satisfies the curiosity that comes from the hype. Other programs addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multi-ethnic societies better. LMOTP will never fall under their entertainment or insight.
