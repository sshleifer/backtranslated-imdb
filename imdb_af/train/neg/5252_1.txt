I read some remarks on the internet about this movie like "... harder than Hostel ...", "the camera screen never gets when it gets really brutal". But none of them is true. The camera screen never turns off because there is nothing to screen. The same scene is repeated a hundred and a hundred times again. Women lay on a table a few times, murder rape women, the murderer cut women into pieces (you never see it during the whole movie!). Police arrested him. Killer fools the jury. Movie over. In Germany we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring movies I ever see. Absolutely not recommended.
