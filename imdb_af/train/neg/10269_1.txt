this movie is outrageous. By outrageous, I mean terrible. I had more fun keeping the paint dry at my local hardware store on an August day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. The acting has become increasingly worse than the "film" advanced, and the directors' use of euphoric drugs has become clearer than the final scenes approached. When misty was shot dead, she decided that it would be wise to cut post-mortem. it was not intelligent. Truly, Stevie Wonder caught it with his eyes. If you decide to play with a nail gun while you are drunk and watch this movie, keep in mind that the nail gun will probably tell you better to tell your friends.
