If you don't mind playing your emotions, then you won't give this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, follow clues and see how they all drop down logically, you'll be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to the disappointment: <br /> <br /> * While the police used the CCTV cameras early to get clues about the puzzle, the big truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before her disappearance did not catch camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It is inconsistent to have the car on which the kids are trapped on the camera and not the big truck that is so critical of the riddle. <br /> <br /> * The movie is largely about the sophistication of the equipment. down from the children's movements, but missed the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment, follow vehicles that could enter the crime scene of camera-visible places adjacent to the crime scene as part of the development of clues. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving on the left. The director goes out of the way to get the car at the crime scene park on the right, a few meters from the flower kiosk, when it can easily be parked behind or even on the side; like the big truck. <br /> <br /> * The police forensic team is so careful to find a discarded cell phone in a sewerage train, a few miles from the crime scene, but can't find any blood evidence. from the head injury right to the crime scene, although they ensured the scene only hours after disappearance and without intermittent rainfall. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs have not been used to find missing children; It is from the country known to develop the dog dog for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story is the presumably innocent truck driver at the flower kiosk. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical for the mother to go to such extremes and make so much effort to leave spoonful of fiber clues under her fingernails for her ultimate murder investigators, even to cherish her daughter for the same - while she is simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could just as easily have asked her daughter to ask for help or even leave the mobile home in an overcrowded home. <Br /> <br /> * The suspect who kidnapped the girl was depicted as being slow / early in spirit - does she unknowingly justify drowning the mother? but he was clever enough not to work with the police and to exercise his rights fully to not be self-righteous. <br /> <br /> There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a truth of aficionado's disappointment. 'Five Days' is a very poor British crime story.
