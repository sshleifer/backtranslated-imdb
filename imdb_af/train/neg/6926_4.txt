I got it in the DVD 10 package COURSE OF DEATH. You must love the bargain. Because even if they are not real remastering, repairing and everything that is high, and the movies are usually in pan-and-scan format, it is not denied that there are always a few gems included. And with "jewels," I mean there are always some good crap to be seen, especially when the 70's is like The Mansion of Madness. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens roll, it's Poe's Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. No matter, really, if crap is crap is crap, no? Yes! But to say this movie is totally worthless is not true at all. There are some funky elements here and there, and of course the movie had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The opening title series is cool, with the colored negative running through a cheap TV watch. The dialogue is always hilarious. Near the start of the movie, the horse and buggy driver come out of a dead tree stump moving in the middle of the road. "What strength!" says our hero. Funny, then this man should not be able to fight the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun. You will completely forget that this man was even in the movie until he came up near the end later. This is how memorable these characters are. <br /> <br /> The best part about Mansion or Madness, however, must be the miserable music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure. It's like a bad cartoon music that would find a three year old enjoyable. And why all the strangers anyway? I want to say my fave moment should be when the horse and buggy are placed through the forest freaks when they pull a stupid, homemade ghost through a stick in the middle of the road and stop the buggy. What the hell? Oh yes, there are also many boobies to be seen for those of you who dig such things. Boobies, bad dialogue, and crazy music. Those best sums of Mansion or Madness to me. It is worth having at least one show, and can be much better if you had a few to drink or what. I can't say I was ever bored to watch it, but I can't deny that it is a barrel either. Just like a Magic Mystery Tour, but with a plot, but not. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Chicken PWNZ.
