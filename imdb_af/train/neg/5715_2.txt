"Say Yes" is one of those flashes you keep hoping to get better, but it never does. This is the kind of "motifless psychopath decided to make an innocent couple," so loved from straight to video filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was numerous and poorly translated in several places. The acting is equally poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think he doesn't cut through a deep voice and tries to talk, but his character seems to be threatening. When it really is, it makes it a little simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves special mention because it is idiotic over all faith. The 'heroes' don't think it's too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The "heroine" succeeds twice in seeing the villain if he is no more than a foot from her. The villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt in blood and a bloody headband) by pointing the police a burning corpse in the passenger seat of the car. The villain was beaten, banged with a shovel and strapped with a fork, but never seemed to be hampered by these, rather serious injuries. And don't even let me start with the terrible 'turn' end. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only plus in this movie, to me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful, but really no more than a mediocre actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie comes out like a poorly written, faintly activated and shockingly-directed attempt to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Trackless', but it fails every time due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.
