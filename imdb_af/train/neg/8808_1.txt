"ASTONISHING" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They had to refer to the fact that such a sorry piece of shit was ever released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals, and kills innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin slides through the film, we also see cut legs, heads etc. What is as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Field set. There is a huge number of talks, a bit of human cuisine and a little zombie hunter who grabbed the sufferers of the mentioned skin disease in his cupboard, tied it to a chair, before putting them in the head, they cut into pieces. .. <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Mostly there is no acting talent on each other, and the gore is legally unrealistic, what is the point of this whole farrago? Looking at the video box again, the person responsible for it is an "underground cult director". Would it be like those strange religious cults where they somehow think you think how clear the opposite is? Because this is the only possible reason why I can think that everyone can look forward to seeing this tax deduction. Then, on the same paragraph he compares himself with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA o stop it. Now you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you enjoy this movie? Are you insulted by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of the said cult. Do they push your wages? Do they see your other relatives? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director since A. Hitchcock? Say it ... it looks like a Panorama special to me. And say hello to the LA critic when you return to your colony, do you? 0/10
