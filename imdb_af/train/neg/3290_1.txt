This movie sucked! They took something out of my childhood and raped it in an outskirts! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and keep my "Dukes" DVDs and crying in a corner. The throw was awful! It wasn't "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was boss Hogg angry? When was Rosco a difficult man? They were never! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When does Jesse smoke pot? He never did! Don't get me wrong, I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it has no place in this movie! The only thing good about this movie was the trailers in front of the movie and the final credits. It was a waste of money time and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
