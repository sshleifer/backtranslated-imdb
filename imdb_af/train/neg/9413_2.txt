I totally agree with the other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason I didn't pick it up was 1 for terribly attributable to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and end are the best parents because of her talented singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the rest of the picture. Alice Faye is completely hollow. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with the miserable writing material, he is so terrible. Cornelis. The plot is very solid here with Ameche adopting two parts as a song and a dancer and a baron. not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems the ameche's marriage is being played by the song and the dancer, a second change. An insane nonsense about the baron that needs to clean up and stay away allows him to play both parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given little to do here and his comic gifts are not given the chance to shine. Ditto for J. Carrol Naish who actually looks uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> It's a chic chic tree bomb of a movie.
