It was a horrible movie! Not for the subject, but for the delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit about oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police repression, with no end to end. The previews and advertisements did NOT mention this! Plus, for everything they played, wieopi goldberg, my memory is that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you'd expect it, but that's just the problem). If I knew how depressed this movie would be, I'd never seen it. Or at least I would be prepared for it. It was a bait and link advertising campaign, and I will never see this movie again!
