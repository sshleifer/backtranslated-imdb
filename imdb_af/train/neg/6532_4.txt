The film starts with people on Earth who discover that their rocket to Mars has not been lost, but has just drifted into space near the planet. When it is detected, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told by the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was allegedly attacked by a whole host of many crazy bug-eyed monsters. Strange, while the sets were pretty good, were the samples under the silliest I saw on film. Plus, in a strange realism attempt, production uses a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation only made the movie cheap when on Mars's surface. The intensity of the red blew my eyes - it was so bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film had a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre it is worth seeing. For others, you can only find the whole thing rather stupid - see yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> While it's up to today's standards, it's not a particularly good sci-fi movie compared to the movies being made. <br /> <br /> PS - Looking at the movie, pay close attention to dr. Tremayne. He looks like the spitting image of dr. Quest of the "Jonny Quest" cartoon! Plus, he sounds and also does a lot like him.
