Watching a video recording of about 8 different 1994-1997 Spider spiders made me realize why I couldn't stomach it when it first came out. <br /> <br /> I'm from the old school, where the 1967 Spider-man cartoon was the best and still the best. (I won't be in the psychedelic version that is terrible - please give me the traditional villains.) <br /> <br /> Acting in the new stuff is common, reading a sheet, with no feelings or over-hearing no. Paul Soles, where are you now? This man was the best on voice acting for Spider man. Nobody comes close. Watching secret wars, a good idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me falter. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent while Ock is heavy Russian! The 1966 old Marvel comic hero series had much better voting. Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritative, not like a teenage boy. Paul Frees as the thing in the 60's was the best thing ever. The old voice actors were pioneers and there would never be anyone like them. Have you ever heard Mel Blanc's son? He can't repeat his dad. <br /> <br /> The animation is bunch. Okay, so they have all the fancy screens and beautifully painted backrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes when you move the computer, it becomes a robot. I really don't think any of these animateurs know what's intervening. <br /> <br /> The stories are badly written, and some of the lines they give to the heroes are terrible. Why, for example, when the heroes join forces for the first time, do they start fighting together? In secret wars it was a lame excuse they got into disagreement. I can see if the hero was dark, unfamiliar and secretive - like the Punisher, but why the Thing and Iron Man can't hold each other apart is ridiculous. Then the Torch is connected. It's just one of the later comics tendencies to get heroes to square for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see those things. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be deducted, but "Hey what are you doing here" and "You don't tell me what to do" are LAME reasons. Another badly written scene is in the wedding where Harry Osborne swapped him to spoil Peter's wedding. The whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> Finally, but certainly not the least, is what another critic calls. Youth violence - this doesn't mean a punch. In Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully exercised the thing. But the thing bumps the bad guys over a whole block into the comics. He just has to return to lift heavy things and suppress a bad man by holding him in the cartoons. Certainly, these cartoons were not made strictly for our adults, but for children under 12. Therefore, they cannot punch, because mum and dad don't believe in that kind of violence. But you can inflate things, these cartoons will include it. As a child before political correctness became fashionable, I saw cartoons bumping into each other. What's wrong with a punch for the chops? Is there really less violence in the world today, because the smooth and clever new cartoons have taken the punch? I find it the most insulting of all if I look at the new things. They wrote the "punch" because we can all hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Children, enjoy these cartoons all you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
