... and yet we were told, there was another hour and 20 minutes to go. <br /> <br /> Why, oh why wasn't there an editor to tell the author / director to snip, sneak? Apparently that writer / director had previously done shorts; As a short, it would have been good. But the lack of dialogue begins after 20 minutes of stirring. The lack of many musicians. The background sounds (talk, traffic, and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) are getting really fast. But the worst failure is in the story. There is precious little outside for a short while. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw all the variations of the same scene over and over. I almost shouted on the screen: "We'll get it, we'll get it !!!!!" It's amazing that afterwards we could leave the theater, go to the Daily Show and go to parts of the Colbert report, get ready for bed and know that the audience was still caught in THEATER. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to welcome your vision. You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
