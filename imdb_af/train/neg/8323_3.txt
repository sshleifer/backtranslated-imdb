From the beginning, this movie had some flaws. The main characters played by Hayden Christensen are a rich young man who inherited his father's great wealth and power. He struggles to both fill his father's shoes and keep the apron strings' mother (and co-CEO). He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor register. There are also small stories that ignore your first instinct, which later becomes important, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his middle-class girl romance (Jessica Alba). Unconscious story lines, but not bad enough to destroy the movie. The only real "oy vey!" moment was the name of Lena Olin's character. Surviving woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciate it, people who find surgical scenes are frightening. The horror of waking up during anesthesia was first done well. You look in emotional pain while Christensen moves inside through the chest incision and ribbed spine. The moment of the irony of the trailers then comes true, while being one of the unfortunate ones to wake up during anesthesia, he is also lucky because he helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to kill him. <br /> <br /> However, the big twist is very predictable and sends the film to the conspiracy and its memories of the tiny signs that were there, but he, like us, initially missed out. <br /> <br /> There are two more twists to the end regarding his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin, who is unimpressed because of poor writing. The other is a secret about the family's past, which was very upbeat and useless. <br /> <br /> The initially well-done anesthetic awareness drama is lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is a final effort to bring it back to falling flat, taking the whole movie with it.
