It's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. It's so bad I really found it enjoyable. The acting, oh my god, the writing, you must be a kiddin. "How can you imagine the writer coming up with things like: - a child who makes fireworks in the school, fireworks so powerful that when someone is touched by them, they fly a hundred yards back and explode. -A girl is trapped in the cell, the killer tries to break open the door. She gets a drill, but the wire is not long enough. she first made an extension cord, o the horror, and then, when she finished, she drilled through the door and drilled through the head of the killer. WOW - and there are many more examples. oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy was he cute (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
