Nowadays, it's kind of a tendency to look at all performances from the early 90s as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia nowadays), and while some of the performances are undoubtedly good, this is just a pure crap. I watched this show very much back in those days as it was on television many times and even as a child I didn't like it. Even an 8-year-old can see how many people in Power Rangers persuade, and how much has the special FX even sucked. When the show does not resort to the painful bad 'fighting' scenes, it bothered the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers and occasionally they have little social problems. I don't know about you, but I didn't give a rotten ass at all, and it basically fills them until they have to fight a few men in a very clich√©-alien costume with fireworks or toy robots. You never feel in any way involved with this show, and the fact that most actors act like there really is no interest, except that their wallet only increases the lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing unforgettable about this show, and it's pretty surprising that it has so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is just a quick way to make money. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what stands out exactly in episodes that are supposed to be so good, because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly attractive to children. My guess is that most Power Rangers fans will tell me I just can't get it, or something along that line. I really don't care; It was again a bit, and it is still crap.
