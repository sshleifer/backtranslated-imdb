If you want to see a good movie about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this movie is not the movie you want to see. It was a social commentary on a woman who made victims and fought back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim persuades to use vigilantism. She essentially destroys the legal system. The film "The Accused" was a much better movie because the victim used and won the legal system. What the lineage means is to tell victims of assault that they have to resort to violence? Is the victim better than the prosecutor? No !!!
