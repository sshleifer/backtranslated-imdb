The only reason I watched this movie was because I recently read Robert Hough's less than perfect but interesting, fictional version of the life of Big Cat coach Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I didn't realize I checked the movie later on the IMDb that it was originally a series. Whoever printed the original run time of 233 minutes to the 68-minute version available on DVD has done a good job. The abbreviated version plays just as well as any B-movie of the period despite the very 'duh-what'? moments. For example, are we really expected to believe our hero dug that morning that a morning twenty-meter deep trap without even dirtying his iodhpurs? Look at the chapter titles I see number five titled "Gorilla Warfare" and number eleven is called the "Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the movie at all. I think that's where the tracks are made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
