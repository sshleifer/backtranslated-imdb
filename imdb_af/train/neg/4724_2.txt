This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was very disappointed. The director knew little of John Lennon and even said so much at the premiere. It's a drama, but people laughed about how cute the movie was. It's never a good sign. The only savings were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates / group mates. They were funny, while the rest of the movie itself was too serious. The cute fall of Beatles lyrics was just absurd. However, the soundtrack was excellent and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you are one of those crazy, racial Dominic Monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.
