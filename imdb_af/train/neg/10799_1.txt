This movie is so, so awful, that angels lose their wings. Shaq tried to make other transitions, such as his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his abundance of unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic ministry of horrible movies that are Steel. <br /> <br /> There is no good thing to say about this movie. I saw it a lot of times when I was very young, but I had to be an idiot, because this movie takes everything that is nice about movies and tears it apart. It's fun to spot. I saw it on the Disney channel for a while and spent a few minutes on it. Although, once the excitement of ridicule has been done, you are still overwhelmed by its horror. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, try it: consider watching the movie, all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genius. If you do, it becomes like a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and sneaking at him. It's so funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A nice example of film. Do not, unless you have tried to mock it, see this movie.
