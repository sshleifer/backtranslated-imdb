I'll make this short and sweet .... suck this movie !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the best movies ever, it brought 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought maybe part 2 and 3 would be good successors, I was wrong. This movie bored me dead and was so different from the first one, it continued the plot and that's it. It was like a bad issue of sharing one or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him. I was so happy about Glenn Danzig who was in this movie, but she didn't shine, you'll miss him. There was a full movie full of mockers and people I didn't like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a fresh air to see Ethan Embry. He is one of the funniest people on earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you a little less like the first one, so don't look because you feel you owe it to yourself, a fan of part 1. I'll wait a few days before I look at part 3 and I pray that it is better than this crap. <br /> <br /> The last scene of The Lightning movie was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on the film. Fast forward or skip over if you can't stomach the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - it was terrible!
