The 40-year-old Virgin exists in a world I don't understand. A world where an electronic store employee can say his boss "f *** down" and videos broadcast from his naked ass throughout the store and not be criticized. A world where it's really funny to drive drunk driving and smash in other people's cars. A world where a boss seems to be harassing her sexually. A world full of furious and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without funny jokes! I'm absolutely shocked at the apparent chorus of viewers holding this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to start with, stretching beyond all rational thoughts. The chest scene continued. <br /> <br /> The characters, except Carell, were completely one-note. And the romantic elements are completely confronted, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. It was just lame. <br /> <br /> And I also found the "Aquarius" series totally annoying and excessive. I hate hating, hate this movie!
