How do you play fat Italian that hardly can draw martial arts without needing heart medication? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at its lowest level of performance. Since his career began, it has been a steady decline in pathetic survival that has driven his career away. In this movie, it seems as if most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo every day in his restaurant. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slow and very old in this movie, almost a martial arts action hero, more like a laugh gap. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire - this movie is about 2 hours reason why. <br /> <br /> Plot: fat Italian man with a great reputation Power gets the wind that a crime group can play around with a drug designed by the army to create the ultimate warrior response. This look, though pathetic and laughing, occasionally offers the opportunity to spread out the best battles, used through the walls as a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this movie sucks completely and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I have.
