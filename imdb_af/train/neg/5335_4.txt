It was a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy, and I just forgot how idiotic it is. I'll put it easily in the bottom two or three of Elvis Presley's worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull rider returning to Arizona and the broken hut where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offer anything of substance, comic or otherwise. The government invested in the family's cattle, but they lacked a bull. Elvis only gets a few totally worthless songs, and is being pursued by a young boy-crazy gall and her gun-virgin mother. It's just a real mess of a mess, and the dilapidated environment bumps lots of dung and doesn't make it that much easier. However, the one thing that riddles me is that Elvis is actually a good time in the movie. Hard to believe, as he got so upset that he was making so many mediocre movies.
