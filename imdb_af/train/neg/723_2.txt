I just didn't get this movie. Was it a musical? no .. but there were choreographic songs and dancing in it ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama .... no, the acting wasn't good enough. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a serious, serious actor. Definitely not. <br /> <br /> I had trouble staying awake through this free movie. The message about apartheid and the "tribute" to the students who died during a student's uproar is noticed. But as entertainment it was very poor and as a documentary movie it was worse. <br /> <br /> See yourself, but in fairness I hated it.
