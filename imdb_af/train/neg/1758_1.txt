If you haven't seen it yet, I just say, go for a walk in the park, don't waste your time. Not the scenario or the play is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can't decide what was worse: The movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very doubtful. I hope she can improve it over time. The storyline is just incredible. Single gun US police spokesman in Europe on its own? Notorious Slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunters ??? An emotional art teacher leading a relentless gang? Spanish police executive dumbbell as a pocket hammers ??? Give me a chance. However, there is only one good thing about this movie: At least, the production cost should be lower than "Ocean's 12", which was so meaningless and above this one.
