A very good story for a movie that, if done properly, would be interesting, but where's the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is its point? <br /> <The screens move as fast as you feel you were not part of the movie emotionally, and the sense of disengagement to understand the storyline. <br /> <br /> The cast of the cast is doubtful, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I think we should wait for the successor. <br /> <br />
