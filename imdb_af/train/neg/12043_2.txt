I love Brad Pitt a lot. He is an actor with brain and white, not face, pectoral and all others. Since I saw him in Thelma and Louise, a thought bothered me, who does he remember me? Troy did it for me. He's the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious, of course. Male, American, but Brigitte Bardot comes in mind. He is so beautiful that he plays most effectively when he plays. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-sufficient humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only photos with Pitt, semi-nude in overwhelming sprint positions, will adorn the walls of saliva friends legions. Strangely, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What does Wolfgang Petersen do? Well, I think it will be very difficult to say no to the chance to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
