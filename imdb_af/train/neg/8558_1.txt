This movie was absolutely horrible, I even feel uncomfortable and call it a movie. This is the typical "mumblecore" movie, with zero plot and a lot of purposeful, twiny somethings that stumble to try to portray things. I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but we can be honest, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> I'm not out of sync with the movie, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idiots are one of my favorite movies. So I don't care if a movie is made cheap, as long as there is any (any) substance. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is terrible, the acting, the writing (or was it all improvised?), the direction, but most of all, above all, the camera work was simple and simple nonsense. The camera was never logical, there was no consistency. I have to admit that I was a man I heard there was nudity in this movie, so I thought to myself well, even if it was terrible, there was nudity (yes, I know I'm a while). Well, thanks to the uber crappy camera work, you never really get to see anything, and the things you see trust me - you don't want to see. This film made me vomit on several levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has made me vomit, the camera work made me vomit, but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics. Now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.
