For starters, "Hobgoblins" are trying to monkey the more successful "Gremlins". It's bad enough, but they don't even try to make something that looks like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a bargain basement, everything-must-go embarrassment scenes, inappropriate sound FX, which is as greasy as unmade tapioca and a script that takes everything down in their moving photos and throws them in the old tube -aroo. <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr .... Mediating children trace obscene creatures from movie parties before killing people by portraying their fantasies. Sounds cool, does it? Well, see the wall on the other side of your room? Start right, top speed, face first. Look, it's cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare doubt? Fast, call something else, one of the leads is in other than this. What other scripts have the writers done since "Hobgoblins"? Mention another Rick Sloane direct effort. How many "Hobgoblins" action figures do you have? See? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I've taken so long to write such a horrible movie. I'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" it is and it's bad - bad as your grandfather's background, bad like pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as underwear that says "Home of the Whopper" ... and I think we'll be there stop. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight bravely, but try as they please, they can do just as much with "Hobgoblins" before they realize that, yes, the director, must be kicked in sham. br /> <br /> Real, real hard. <br /> <br /> One star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
