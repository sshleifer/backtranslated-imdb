If someone wants to make a real, VERY bad movie, 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' really sets a benchmark to measure the depth of bad. Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... A few poor schmuck in a bag of white "hairy" costume that seems to have been sown with the torn pieces of carpet. Work slowly, painfully, through more non-special effects that the viewer denies thoroughly from the suspension of unbelief. Add a nook (just for the heel). <br /> <br /> With the second thought, this movie is completely over and finds something else to do for an hour and a half.
