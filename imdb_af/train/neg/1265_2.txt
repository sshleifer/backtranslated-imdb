I didn't even want to see this movie, because the trailer gave the impression of a general and anticipated movie ... but as I recently had the pleasure of wonderfully aiming for the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" written by Laurent Tirard (scriptwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, and think "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "humanity ..." And it is absolutely not. The writing is not bad, but it is not as good as Mensonges. The actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, such as sowing Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and honestly I still don't understand how such crap can have such a success, even with such a decisive thing. anyway, the story can be a pretext for creating so many interesting plots, but it's not as good as Tirard's "Mensonges ..." although it's also written by him, easy, unobtrusive and lazy work.
