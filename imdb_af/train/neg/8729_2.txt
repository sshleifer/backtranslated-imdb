It's a thrill with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions around the world, but it's confused and incompatible in the performance. <br /> <br /> Garcia stars as John Berlin, a LA forensic detective who moved to a small town in California, at the request of a friend of his on the power there. He quickly becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder that leads to his theorizing on the existence of a serial killer where no one else believes. The well-known victim is theoretically blind, leading to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby blind school. <br /> <br /> Despite a basic intriguing story, there were too many quantum jumps and plot holes in this movie where I found myself: "How did we do it? wind here?" or "how did we do it discovered?' I found it confusing and unaffected, despite the good acting, etc. John Malkovich did a little to the end as a F.B.I investigator to get Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
