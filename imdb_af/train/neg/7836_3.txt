The first episode made the bar quite high, I thought. It played William Hurt as a hit contracted to kill a toymaker. We get very little information about his character or who pays him to kill. Indeed, the episode is noticeable that he has no conversations at all. Returning to his modernist penthouse he delivered a package of toy soldiers, giving him a smile, but he fired it and went over his business. But he is in for a night of hell, the soldiers live and is about to wage war, ride jeeps, shooting machines and bazookas and even flying helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show, and it gets pretty tense as he wanders around the apartment using his mind to survive, sometimes get the upper hand and other times. I won't spoil the end, but enough to say it was a clever little turn. It gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all rubbish and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King adjustments are always a mixed bag and this is no exception
