Three Russian aristocrats are enjoying the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite the fact that they are going to their last franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a forger and use the notes at the casinos in the hope of exchanging the counterfeit currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an American envoy, comes to Monaco with his wife, Helen, and the three decide to make friends with the visitors and hope for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to move on, with continuous forward to Helen, while disappointing the count's girlfriend, who loves Sergius. Eventually, conditions play their hand against the three aristocrats. Obviously, Von Stroheim is trying to send a message (with the folly of American women and the improper conduct of the aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the film can actually be modern audiences like I easily tolerate. Even the play, which in later EVS, like Greed and the Wedding March, is nice, just runs from the mill here. The film could have used improvements at various levels. Rating, 3.
