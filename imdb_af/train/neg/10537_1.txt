Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adjustment? <br /> <br /> There are a few incredible actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are clear. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (well-suited) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want a "viewable" customization of Cartland, the Bonham Carter is the one to go ("A Danger of Hearts" - which is a title !!). Gilbert is the weak link in it, but Bonham Carter is pretty nice and can of course act, and the rest of the role playing it with the tongue in the cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
