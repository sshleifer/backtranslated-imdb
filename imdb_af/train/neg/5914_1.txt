This movie is really boring. It's banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. This is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of such a low quality. I never want to pay money to see it. I love movies by Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed. Such a poor movie can come from China. It seems to completely ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself. The shots of a person standing there do nothing for a minute, are hilarious and there are plenty of them. The cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the Net and people seem to like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie buffs think that if a movie isn't in English, it's automatically good. I can't see why people like it. It is not an art film, it is of celluloid waste. (That's when they actually shot it on film, which they didn't do)
