What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox, has fallen to a wobbly triple. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the forces at Fox decided to "refine" the plot line. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they lost my total as a viewer (not even Jessica Alba!). I found that the new characters added in the second season are too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines stretched the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the episodes of the second season they even had Max to sleep and dream - where the first season said she couldn't sleep biologically. <br /> <br /> The morale of the story (the one Hollywood never gets): If it works, don't screw it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
