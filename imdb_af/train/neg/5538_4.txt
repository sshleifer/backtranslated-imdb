It's not really a zombie movie, as we define zombies as the dead walk around. Here, starring Armand Louque (played by an amazing young Dean Jagger) gets control over a method to create zombies, but his "method" is to test his mind spiritually and control other people's thoughts, to put them in making hypnotized slaves. . This is an interesting concept for a movie, and is much more effective by Fritz Lang in his series "Dr. Mabuse 'movies, including' Dr. Mabuse the Gambler '(1922) and' The Testament of Dr. Mabuse '(1933). Here it is unfortunately subservient to his quest for the love of his former fiance, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Heche, looks like a bad hairstyle, Dorothy Stone) which is actually the main theme. <br /> <br /> The movie began a plot, as Louque was sent to a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the cult of the zombies that came from it. At some sort of compound (where we get 30's sets and clothes), he announces his fiance to Claire, and barely five minutes later, she gives him his ring for her partner, Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland). It's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact. It would have been a wonderful movie for 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' if they haven't yet fried it. <br /> <br /> It was never shown how Louque actually teaches the "zombification" secret, but he then uses it to kill his enemies, creating a giant army of guns carrying soldiers and bodyguards. We will not see such a power until John Agar in The Brain From Planet Arous (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry him if he will make Greyson live and return to America. Louque agrees, but actually changes him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On their wedding day, he realized that Claire would love him first if he gave his "powers". To get her love, he does it, which causes the 'uprising' of the title, in which all his slaves wake up and attack his connection and kill him. Greyson embraces Claire, and we seem to be at the end of a parable: "Whoever destroys the gods will first make them angry." <br /> <br /> So really, it's not that bad of a movie, despite the low IMDb rating it currently has. With repeated views (?), One can see the art in well-formed writing! Dean Jagger still had to develop into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youth. Is it really his own hair? We remember him more for his bare, old roles in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'X The Unknown' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958). The story borrows many of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers better, earlier film "White Zombie" (1932), in which the unlucky Robert Frazier (like Charles Beaumont) uses "zombification" to Madge Bellamy's love (such as Madeline Parker) win. . <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!), I start with "White Zombie" (1932), "King of the Zombies" (1941), "I walked with a Zombie '(1943),' Night of the Living Dead '(1968),' The Last Man on Earth '(1964) and his two remakes. In the modern era of classic films, there are 'Horror Express' (1972),' The Serpent and the Rainbow '(1988), '28 Days Later' (2002) and his successor, as well as many, many others. <br /> <br /> This one is not really a zombie movie. To judge this movie on its own terms, it is more of a semi-Gothic romance. As such, it is somewhat below some of Universal's bottom-billed late 30's and early 40's B horror movies. So I'll give it a 5.
