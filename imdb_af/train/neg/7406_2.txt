Well, how was it supposed to know it was the "silly donkey promotion" Lordi Motion Picture? I mean, I realized when that "dinosaur" costume arrived and by the time the lead singer made his appearance, I immersed myself "Hard Rock Hallelujah" ... although I hated that song. "Dark floors" are about a young autistic girl who is swallowing her over a protective father out of hospital when they and the rest of the people in that particular lift are temporarily trapped on their floor, it comes as a surprise to find that there is no one else.The hospital is empty ... Except for a variety of samples they do not seem to bump. through the corridors and stairs, which meet all the band members of the heavy metal band in their foreign countries, shock clothes costumes ... nothing really memorable here, except the common acting, lack of gore / nudity, and the completely shameful promotion, what remind me of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, remember that Dud? Wish I didn't ... I just want to recommend avoiding all these Ghost House movies like a fungus and not listening to Lordi as they are a Gwar ripoff band!
