What has Martin Scorcese ever had to recover this movie? And he didn't just regain it, completely destroyed it? The nonsense decision to characterize the character Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance and it says a lot) in a religious fanatic, is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes that Hollywood (and Mr. Scorese) attaches - the attitude authors force to think that the best way to make a character is to tattoo a crucifix on its back. Anyway, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
