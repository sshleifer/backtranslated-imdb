<br /> <br /> The movie "Slugs" is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrible story of nature. You see, these poor snails are mutated by the pollution of the evil people and do not mean to do anything malicious, they are just snail snails with sharp teeth that eat meat and excrete poison, but snails no less. The really bad guys are the people, who are also actively trying to destroy or over-react our beloved snails when they meet them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the man is sitting on the glove full of snails. They were just asleep in a comfortable work glove when this giant hand did not come from nowhere, and they instinctively responded, defended themselves and bite the man. Now, instead of looking for medical attention for his snail bite, this man walks around his greenhouse like an idiot, shouting like an idiot, pouring a few highly volatile chemicals, lighting a fire, a booklet on his hitting hands and cutting off his own hand and mixing volatile chemicals and exploding his home. How can you give it to snails? <br /> <br /> This movie paints a portrait of people who are less than favorable. The characters in this movie include the stupid sheriff who all hates, the drunk heel that means to his dog and the clumsy side button whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a set of drunken teens <br /> <br /> attacked while they are copulating, and we need to see the genitals of the generous long haired freaks. Meanwhile, there is a man who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson shouting: "You don't have the authority to declare happy birthday!" for some reason. Eventually, this parade of cruelty is rounded off by the MST3K classic "Pod People" whose face exploded after eating a snail-lighter salad. (Another easily avoided fate on the useful, harmless snails). <br /> <br /> People are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and in one senseless scene, such as rapists. In the film's climactic scene, the villains are trying to burn the snails that are helplessly in the sewer column. Well, since they are idiots, people manage to blow the whole city. They only do more damage than the snails that ever did! <br /> <br /> If you hate people and I know, you'll appreciate "Slugs". If you are a fan of a bad theater, you will also appreciate this crapfest of the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There are plenty of bad acting, stupid dialogs, illogical plot twists, special special effects, useless scenes and poor dubbing to keep your attention.
