To try and pay cash for the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100, this excuse comes for entertainment - Show me the money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shine bright red hooker clothes. A participant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as "Which team has lost ..." with three choices, A, B, or C, each completing the phrase. The participant has three chances to answer one of these three choices. The host - William Shatner, with his heaviest smarmiest - asks the participant if he wants an answer in the answer "and when the participant says yes, he chooses a dancer, to whom he shouts:" Show me the money! "She makes a book that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his profits. If he was wrong, the amount is deducted. (So theoretically it is possible for a participant to this urgent debacle to actually win on Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the contestant chooses the girl who has the crazy role, but he replied properly, nothing happens. , the game goes to the Sudden Death and needs to answer a different question. If he gets that one wrong, he leaves nothing. <br /> <br /> Before he goes into advertising, Shatner screams, "let's dance" and Shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for a last dance and they all shake it even more. <br /> <br /> I show this show 6 episodes most, and hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown (it could have been worse - they could overthrow Cuba Gooding Jr. Honor to be the host, although I think he is a better dancer than 'Shat', as they call him today.) <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It lasts for just 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
