Thin story refers to two small village brothers and their fight over family honor. David Morse is the responsible, direct policeman and 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, the 'bad' boy, is a former soldier and ex-convict. As an actor (especially in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to be modeling his achievements under the Method. As a first-hand writer and director for this art, turbulent drama, he works out his manuscript and characters through the same methodological process, which slows down the tempo (apparently so we can catch every nuance and bow). This approach can be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters, but photographic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as brothers and sisters. Worse, we expect more of prominent renowned veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get a chance to go through anything interesting. The picture is balky with turgid sequences, a wobble narrative and confusing editing (always oblique to show the artistic remains). Penn's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye, but it's mostly an annoyance. * 1/2 of ****
