I wonder if there is a sense of meaning in this movie. It's a big joke. Good .. Its entertaining. You get the most stupid plot that is played very seriously in the form of a movie. I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted. <br /> <br /> Priety) plays a surrogate mother for a happy couple Salman / Rani who wants a child, but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama were a real ending to a real couple's life. <br /> <br /> Rani looks happy with another beautiful woman in her home brought in to make a child. for her and Salman. She cares for Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity so they can have some romance. When will the audience be satisfied with Salman's nakhras. <br /> <br /> Although it's a good time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
