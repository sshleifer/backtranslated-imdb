Unless you are mentally ill or the strongest season friends, you will notice this incredible excuse for a movie in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot - even for a Seagal movie, is just the plot. I mean it's not just bad, it's hardly coherent. <br /> <br /> The Acting - Incredible Wood. Literally seen better acting in porn. Ironically, this film is trying on this audience that is a lesbian love scene that is totally inexorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - won't look out of place in a 60's sword and magic movie. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all the other drugs, don't make the same mistake I did and buy this DVD, because you'll be asking for half your life. .
