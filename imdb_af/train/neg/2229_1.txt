Maybe it's not fair because I just made it halfway through the movie. One of the few movies I really couldn't see due to clumsiness. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a chef's agreement, the cooks are only released in a briefcase. I'm not knowledgeable, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same silly sound effect when a punch is thrown (this is the top crunching sound and they use toy guns called sound effects. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever.
