The idea of ​​making a miniseries about the Berlin airlift was one of the more interesting German (after) war films. This is a theme that has not been much researched yet. The makers of this series, however, filled it with clichés. It all starts with the DVD cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) hears that her husband, who is a doctor (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war she struggles to survive. She finds a job at the American base, gets work for the coolest and highest ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in town, falls in love with him, gets pregnant, and suddenly her husband gets up again. Come on !!! We've seen it all too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role very well; However, Bettina Zimmermann never really looks convinced. For some reason it always seems as if she is too late to give the right emotional response to the scenes. It just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> The action scenes with the planes and the airlift, we are sometimes exciting, more often not. Nasty things always seem to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: Chocolate cream gives you much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
