It is a movie that relies only on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. This is it. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sexes" is absolutely absent. The play and dialogue are more suitable for high school children, but the subject is intended for adult audiences. It's an unnecessary and shallow movie. It could have been better if it had a story and more drama. Alas, one more thing: why are inner monologues used so excessively? It seems cheap. All in all an embarrassment to the Romanian film as well as to adult audiences trying to view it. I know the means are scarce, but it's not always an excuse for a movie as it does. Please start with some good actors in your movies and stop recruiting them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!
