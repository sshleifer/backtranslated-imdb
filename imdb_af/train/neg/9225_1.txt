CQ could have been good, fun. But it links the only unforgivable sin: it's b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is deadly slow and the plot is pretty confused and so artificial that it is impossible to care where it goes. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class of a thoughtful and sensitive eighth degree, but this video had to have a warning label: "WARNING: Student movie. Suitable for just watching by movie-maker relatives."
