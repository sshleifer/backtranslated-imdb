I've seen myself part of Woody Allen's movies, and while they're not always great, you can be sure you'll be entertained. Probably the last really good Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95). Since then, the one I saw has been unfinished but viewable. And when I was invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, which I had not even been aware of, I happily listened. I didn't hear much of it, so I hoped I'd be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I saw. The premise is to explain, the role is terrible, the writing is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes didn't say anything and yet stretched out, I assume to fill what would otherwise be a 15 minute short film. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the concept behind this movie - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and of course the movie continues to show us by playing both scenarios. The problem is not one of these two movies. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. Allen seems to have come with a good idea, but then no longer had steam or time to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The general level of acting is also bad. Will Ferrell is the only one to bring something to the table, and it's basically a Woody Allen impression. Previously, good actors like Chloe Sevigny are just as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (it's a shame because her character is in virtually every scene!). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the actors, the writing they work with is missing if it doesn't exist. Definitely a long way from Allen knows us and loves classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
