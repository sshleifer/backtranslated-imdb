Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performances in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role does not need. She didn't say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave who was given the marriage of Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). In ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance because that is what Luise has to receive her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to act. It looks like something Hollywood often does. Al Pacino played Italian and Cuban. I felt that Luise's performance was dark throughout and when she died, she didn't change the expression of any previous scene. She remained the same throughout the film; She may have changed her expression or emotion twice. If her brilliant play was so subtle, I don't think I saw it.
