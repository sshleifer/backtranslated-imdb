Simply awful! Why don't you use real actors? Look, it must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want to send any credibility or message sent via these low-budget movies ... please use the right actors for the love of God! Most will work for free ... benefit! Now back to my comments ... anyway, the humor was lower than that of the bathroom variety and was not funny at any level. Regarding the quality ... in one scene filmed on a public transport bus, you could see the mirror image of the crew ... guess what? It was one guy with what looked like a Sony video camera and probably not his. Well, I suppose the only audience for this movie is people with a bad fetish ... and it wasn't even good gore.
