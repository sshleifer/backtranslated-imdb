Watched it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my better judgment, I managed it, but it was a little ... poor (mostly I saw it from the teenage boy's family.) I mean, the writing was not a star, but the actors did not let me understand. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. The characters are similar, and the plot is not challenging or disturbing. It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don't count it badly spent fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> But I don't recommend it.
