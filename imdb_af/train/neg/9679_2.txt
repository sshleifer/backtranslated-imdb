This movie was terrible at worst: you just didn't mind. You don't care what happened in the plot; You don't care about the characters. Everyone had no heart. Eventually I left about 45 minutes away because I simply didn't want to think about it anymore. There is far too much sex in the movie. Sex can be good; It can even make the movie (hence Karma Sutra), but the deal here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Don't see this movie.
