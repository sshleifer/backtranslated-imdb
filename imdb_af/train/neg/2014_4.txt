I remember loving this show when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I saw. It was ultra high technology because it was time. It can repel the fire of the enemy, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and take off almost anything in the way. Now I'm going back and watching it today and I'm amazed at how supposed this show really is. The role players are almost compelling, there are many chaotic moments, and the battle scenes are incredibly fake. And almost every end has the same helicopter fighting shit with the obvious reuse of granular low-quality stock footage. Much of the footage is evident from the Vietnam War era. <br /> <br /> Airwolf basically has the same theme as Knight Rider, except that the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I was completely bored. However, I love the theme music.
