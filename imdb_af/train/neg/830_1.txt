I don't really understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but horrible in this movie. But I don't think it's her own fault, but the directors. He somehow managed to make everything look artificial; they act, the idea, the makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is just for the idea behind the movie, which was very badly executed. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this store, check out a Fellini, Woody Allen, or some David Lynch.
