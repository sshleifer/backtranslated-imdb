It's available on a double row in Dark Sky Movies, and since I just finished Barracuda, I've also watched it. It's a movie that remains incredibly ambitious and inactive at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young ladies wandering the streets of a strange town, but where is it exactly? They stop looking at necklaces from a Chinese supplier and try Chinese clothes at a store, but then we see some Aztec dancers? And all those times, these girls are followed by two guys who eventually drop any stealth, they haven't followed the girls on a wild run, already in town. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a rope around her neck, and these guys want to find the booty, and where did they get it? So, in flashback, we go back to find out. And how did they know she had this coin? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat and after they stopped getting air In their tanks they bring this young boy back to his house-to-do, just to get his grandfather out and invite the "young" east for herb tea with grandmother. But not everyone has tea, Todd returned to the boat to look at the young girls, and when they left, the boat blew up and when they returned home, their friends mysteriously disappeared. Well, it looks like these "friendly people" are raising their own vegetables, but they are waiting for the meat to fall for a game, and put it on herbs. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd have the island, but now they are back, escorted by their prisoners, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it before. There also appears to be someone else on the island, and the thugs are going to die secretly one by one, and since there are only three, it doesn't last long. And there is even a kind of happy ending, which overtakes the viewer every bit as they were throughout the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to be fast-paced with anger issues, and combined with no acting ability, they are spectacular. The Hillbilly-type family is also without the ability to play, despite the fact that the grandfather is Hank Worden, who has appeared in various films and TV shows. The action is confusing, the places are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what is hell? I'm not sure, but it's probably worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.
