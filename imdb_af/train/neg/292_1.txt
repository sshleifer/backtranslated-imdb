I saw it by chance to see on cable and wanted to find it. Sandra was pretty funny about what I remembered. The only facial movement I ever had was that the jaw became drunk about how terribly a movie I just suffered. <br /> <br /> The person who said it was one of the funniest movies of all time, please show one line, just one scene, it's even worth it. <br /> <br /> She's a much better singer than I remember being, but I didn't want to see a lounge law. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie, trying hard to keep as they think they should and don't consider it objectively.
