This movie starts pretty cruel with a woman who is tied and psychologically tortured. There are male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, nipple licking dogs, the female losing control of her bladder. Everything shot in a gray cold color. Effective, but a little too much. We then continue to see the BTK killer's youth as well as the present and his crimes history. The tension is completely psychological and the scenes of the murderer who enter the homes of his victims and talk to them are quite long and it is creepy. Here we do not see fancy or good images, it seems to have been shot with your home camera. It doesn't look scary, but in a way to catch a criminal for some time for its victims, it's quite unusual and cool. What this movie doesn't have is really a drama. There are a few headlines every time, but there is no excitement to find the killer. There is not much of a bow to this story. It could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse material. It's spread through the movie and suddenly comes back up. Sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away. And I must reject that. I'm all for low budget horror movies, but I don't endure animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive and came without warning. I am glad that Lionsgate releases things that no one else does, but they must have passed this movie or the animal has worked out. Stay away from this garbage.
