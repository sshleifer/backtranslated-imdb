The worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie for Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler, I can get cheap laugh." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the film, all three of my friends were asleep and I still suffered. Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against a wall for an hour, then I wanted to stop, and you know why? Because it felt good. After I founded my head, I held and watched the damn movie in the microwave. It felt better than I ever did. It has American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to get over that shit. I HAVE YOUR SANDLER WORKING FOR THIS AND WITH A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
