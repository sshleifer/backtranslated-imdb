As the 2000s came to an end, King Kong's adopted daughter continued and made a tearful announcement that her performance was coming to an end. <br /> <br /> While Missing Winfrey tore, I laughed and shouted like a wild Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> So, what does Oprah do? She takes famous people and puts them on her show. what kind of familiar people? people who have suffered (like her, except these people lost more than their virginity), have melted faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, end of paragraph), and abuse (too much to count). and somehow they come to the show and tell their story as if we didn't hear it before tons and tons (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard your story of a weapon lost to a shark since day one, what October was 31st, 2003. Don't tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the biggest thing probably on Opra was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a child molester. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has since died. but that one particular show told of Michael's personal life, something that many people didn't know at the time. <br /> <br /> Oprah's real influence comes from middle-aged women and soccer. They seem to think she is sometimes like a personal Jesus. But all I see in Oprah is a big ghetto lady who made it big, and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad her shows will end soon. we need better television programs.
