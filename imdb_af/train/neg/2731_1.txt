Actually, bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> They tried to make it up by giving it, "we know we're doing this routine". It would have been funny if it wasn't the fact that 'The Simpsons' had already done so. And it won't fix if they have turned up the idea in the first place. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks took place as part of the usual character (especially J.D's) fantasies. The flashbacks were not even of the real events that took place, only compilations of say, J.D fall over or, I don't know .... Elliott is falling over. If I wanted to see a Scrubs compilation, I'll be on YouTube and not wasting half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Scrubs fell in the fall that has the most sit-coms, and it disappears. I managed to go 5 and a half seasons without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping scrubs wouldn't be that kind of sit-com. <br /> <br /> And just as a passing thought, why was hell Dr.Cox Bald?
