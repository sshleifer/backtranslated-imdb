DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love GOOD sports movies (not so much in baseball, but hey, his sports movies, right? I expected a lot for this movie. It looks good to start: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes (who I really don't do not like) is very good like the spoiled star Barkin's role, for me, was OK, she is a good actress, but stood out of his place in this role, for me they always chased the screens, and then dragged It was a bit in place, it was just as unequal to me! In light of the cast and the plot, it could have been so much better. I rated it a "4" and I was generous ~ I'm a difficult one with numbers!
