Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, it certainly does after this endurance test of a movie. How on earth I managed to continue without hitting the quick forward button the Lord knows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I don't get the point of the movie ... or maybe I don't appreciate the alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were all terrible and there was more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do this? Why do I look like this once? It's enough to run one road and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! An absolutely horrible movie in about every way. In addition, it's not bad.
