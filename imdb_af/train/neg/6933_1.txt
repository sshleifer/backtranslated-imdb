Compared to other Columbo movies, it can only be one (terrible). I don't really understand what the other reviewers saw in this horrible movie accident. It was only through morbid fascination that I continued this - to see what bizarre or improper decision the director would make. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer suggested that it was Falk's only direct outing because it interfered with his acting role. In fact, I think the real reason lies with the studio bosses, who should have been frightened when they saw what he was doing with their money. It's a wonder they didn't kill HIM.
