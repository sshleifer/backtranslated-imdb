Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" of 1987 is a black comedy that is very cheesy in many parts, but sometimes it's very funny. This movie could have been much better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely racial scenes make it difficult to watch, but the concept is funny, and it has some hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (year 1991) games showed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) resides in a game show called Live or Die, in which convicted prisoners of death have the chance to play for their lives and for money. Failed candidates are airborne using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and other, more bizarre means of execution, followed by applause from the cute studio audience. Of course, the show is more than controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies. <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and crazy, in many ways, and the play is terrible, but it is undoubtedly fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. You didn't miss anything if you didn't see it, but it's definitely funny and a good time warmer. 10/04
