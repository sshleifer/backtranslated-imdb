My title, just sums, this hope of shit, I had to take a tip when I saw it was a Fred Olen Ray movie - but I thought 'HEY, THIS MAY BE BETTER AS HIS USUAL RUBBISH' boy I'm wrong! It must be the worst movie ever aimed at children. The acting was terrible, the humor wasn't there. The direction was the worst I have ever seen. The special effects won't look like the 1950's Disney movie. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAS BEEN DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who had such a promising career in the 1980s. Film veteran and former children's actress Russ Tamblyn was a terribly bad man and the budget was so low. It was an incredible accident, even as a kiddie movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't see the successor in 1999 and <br /> <br /> I don't want <br /> <br /> If you want a good kid's movie, look HONES I SHORTS / SMALL CHILDREN / CHILD OR A DRY MOVIE <br /> <br /> MY RATING AS A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> RATING AS A KID MOVIE: - 3 / 10 AT THE BEST!
