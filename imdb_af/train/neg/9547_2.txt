An under the average search video game has turned into some sort of conspiracy to discover the next terrorist in the US backyard. Welcome to the lunacy of cheap made direct to video movies. It's full of no-name actors and actresses with a small valuable plot. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game continues and our "hero" really plays money and does well with it. It's like gambling, except the gambling section is gone and it sucks. Instead, it's an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do well. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more strange is that two strange computer programs somehow fight it and everything is saved in the end. I'll leave the viewer to see how it all comes about. <br /> <br /> Overall, not even worth a $ 1 rental. Please borrow it. "D"
