Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a living in babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother and visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> This start well with a truly ominous sequence in the cemetery ... and then fall apart. The story is thin and there is TONS padding to make the movie 85 minutes. The acting is terrible about the board (with Cole being easily the worst). Toughly focused on some of the WORST editing I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are only cut off with no drive or reason. Also, the film has terrible (and obvious) sound after the production. <br /> <br /> Like blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and that looks incredibly fake. I've never seen such imitation blood - looks like ketchup! Drilling, useless - a straightforward forgotten movie. You can hit this one.
