This film has so little class compared to strangers on a train or even a coincidental event, that despite sudden agreements, I would not feel right to compare it to one of them. The Yancy Butler character generally came, and I was too ashamed of the writer and director to continue watching. <br /> <br /> I don't enjoy many life movies but feel obliged to look occasionally in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often sighed quietly, but this film made me protest aloud, get up and go around the room to mumble around the house before returning to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
