Buy this movie in the bargain at Rogers Video Store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie from time to time and thought it looked like a good one. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite clich√© "1970s" and is very rough. Unfortunately, the story line is hard to follow and not much happens in the movie. In fact, I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and thinking a week later that I had to watch the whole thing, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The movie has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait for them. <br /> <br /> If you are in B-movies, it may just be for you, just be warned that the movie doesn't really happen much, and I didn't mention much story line br /> <br />
