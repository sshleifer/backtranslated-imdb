This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in Japan about a dysfunctional family ending with a strange violent guest sitting back and watching the 4 family members at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such an extent. I'm surprised it's past the sensors. <br /> Overall, I think it will only appeal to those we shouldn't be encouraging, rather than any supposedly underlying message that the rest of us are considering. A movie that is the worst element in society and anyway totally gash ... A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead of Alive and Audition movies.
