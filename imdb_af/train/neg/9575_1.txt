First of all, let's begin by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for being associated with this piece. I had to give it a 1 because it won't give me a zero. Want to know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me "boy, i just watched the stupid movie ever. I responded and said:" The killer tong huh? "She was like what you knew? That's how bad this movie is. It looks like a good movie on the first Freddy pinhead Melinda. Okay, I'll give it a chance. I just got through the rest of this movie I wrote a column for reviews of horror movies, I beg you, don't waste your time or even brain cells on this ridiculous piece of crap. Shop, turn it around and walk away, and I still want to get it back two hours
