I read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago foolishly and told myself, "Looks funny, plus Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose it!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus tax. I took it over to a friend's house and we both sailed about how bad it was written and acted. Wood performances are abundant. All the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never occurred. After 90 minutes, I shook my head, knowing that I could never get those 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I literally almost screamed too, because if it were what could be considered "comedy", I didn't want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours about the horror of this movie that he needed to see just how bad it was. Over the holiday season this year I looked at him because he didn't want to see it alone. This was my next terrible mistake, because as I watched, I was just angry. I started screaming at the movie, and I'm not the one to talk to movie time. Everyone I know even mimicked this movie, agreed it was the worst they ever saw. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often pushes my friends, but it can't even save this movie. The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is amazing. The fact that his rating (at the time of writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
