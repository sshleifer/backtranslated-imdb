Sometimes a point of departure is starting well, but because of the demands to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from a deficiency of depression, it is conveyed in an uncomfortable mess. And for three respected actors who did before and after better work, it's a deadly shame. <br /> <br /> So, let's see. Premise: A loving couple living in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad policeman. Interesting to say the least. Make the offensive cop a bit upsetting, why not. It was well done in the hands of the CRADLE and ANY WHITE WOMAN, and this is proof of a successful game. <br /> <br /> Here lies the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that actually causes difficult threats in its main characters, while never being as far as ridiculous, or throwing a void into reality, exacerbating the shock factor and making this police so extreme - an ultra bad variation every other super-villain who has become theater since the silent age. <br /> <br /> The producers and directors chose the latter. So the tracked film - badly done, with actors trying their beasts to make heads or tails in roles they had previously set up, and nothing less than even less.
