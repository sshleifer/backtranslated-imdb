You must know that I am the kind of person who even watches the worst movies, often out of pure morbid curiosity. I even looked Leprechaun to the end before I was tempted to tear my eyes and bump them. You should also know that this movie was in my video recorder for less than half an hour before I made the stop button a solid leap and drove the rental shop to place as much distance between me and possible.
