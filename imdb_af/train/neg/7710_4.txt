"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" consists mainly of rattling, poorly composed footage looking for a movie. The plot doesn't make sense, and the different characters fall in and out of the picture without any explanation. If you see this dull spoof, you get the feeling when so many other comments have been captured so accurately: it is easy to make a cheap, low quality film and then use the "parody angle" as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (In One scene, female swimmers are afraid of tomatoes floating near them; how far can a suspension of unbelief go - even in a parody?). The title song is great, though. (* 1/2)
