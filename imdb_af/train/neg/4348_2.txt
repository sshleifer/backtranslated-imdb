It was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to see it. Almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really poor. (P.Diddy was the best actor who really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were okay, such as one day's dream to the Carribien, but generally they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was flat wrong, but hey it is debatable. Anyway, I didn't expect much before I watched the movie and I think you can even say that expectations have not been met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he's actually a decent actor (Friday night). He's happy because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. I usually give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest, so I go ahead and give this one two stars. Good luck next time. And yes, I enjoyed Carlito's Way.
