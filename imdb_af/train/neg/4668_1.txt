The potential film expression introduced during the 19th century failed to produce. With big names actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. However, the film did not end, had a sorry excuse for a plot line and fell into pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, brought by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touch of a mother's early death and an absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man who cares for his daughter in life as well as death. He believes his daughter's lack of good looks will destroy his fortune by marrying under his social status. The actors tried in vain to save what remained of the storyline. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time on those who look sad. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' efforts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
