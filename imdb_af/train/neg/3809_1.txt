This show is just annoying !!! I feel sorry for the actors trying to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laugh track trying to cover the sad jokes and the "Awwww" track comes in the most unnecessary times. The over-dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is cliché city. Looking for the word cliché would read "Full House". Each story line has a "life lesson" that must be learned at the end. A juicy speech makes everything better and even the ability to make the most bratty child has a sudden sense of goodness GASP too bad, it can't be real life. I don't know how anyone could see this show without having too bad the behavior of the characters or the laugh track. I found myself screaming on the TV and saying, "THIS IS NOT FUNNY / SAD / CUTE" If life were really that way, the world would fall apart.
