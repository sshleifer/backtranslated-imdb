I saw this movie opening weekend in Australia, with an excellent film by Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, which would unfold the definite story of Ned Kelly in front of me. Unfortunately, despite excellent performance by Heath Ledger in the lead, the plot was paper thin. It doesn't inspire me to read our "Our Sunshine". There were still a few pluses, especially the support from Edgerton, which secured Jordan's direction (which also confirmed his talent at the show in Buffalo Soldiers) and production design that gave the Australian forest a huge sense of hardness Irish immigrants from the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the true story of an Australian folk hero (or was he). In what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the photo in the US. Oh yes, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beard just to remember Universal. <br /> <br /> Guess I'll just be happy with Peter Carey's excellent "Secret History of the Kelly gang". 10/04
