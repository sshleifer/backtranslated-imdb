What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a policeman who withdraws bullets from himself after being shot and kept in a glass bottle in his bathroom (and shot by the size of the pot fifty times) and a top secret tank that holds five or six be. incompetent soldiers driving for some reason in Mexico. Whether they were deliberately sent there or just really lost, they were never made clear. And you'll never hear a screen game again, the word "butthorn". Gary Busey tries the Mel Gibson role from "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is a serviceable actor, the script disappears the whole movie into mediocrity. William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in Red Dawn a few years earlier. Having played most of the 70's in the bikers, it was so nice to see that he expanded his range of Communist hardships. Unfortunately, he will probably always be best remembered as the man in Clint Eastwood in "Every way you can.
