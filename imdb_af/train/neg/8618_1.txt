Incredibly horrible movie. I recently watched part of this on T.V. My khaki dropped when I watched a terrible blast and listened to sensible grief. Not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing something that looks like a visit. It was so bad, it made me stir, Rodney Dangerfield's body, slammed it and shouted, "How can you?" I know many movies are being done soon, hoping to subscribe to the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It is sad and scary that people are expected to pay to see such a three. The bottom of the cesspool, even by Sunday afternoon television standards.
