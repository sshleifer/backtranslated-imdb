Recreation of the 1950s (London) Soho and the Emerging People. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give him $ 15 million and he'll make you a $ 15 million pop video. Here he forgets those two minutes with people who can't really act is one thing - only two hours? What is he thinking about? Besides who is the audience? Who cares for a well-remembered book was back. The ordinary London story of the chancellor takes his chance. <br /> <br /> What could really make this movie even more subtle? Oh, I know, third songs that sound like they're made on the spot. David Bowie crones the movie title over and over several times and this is the highlight. The soundtrack album is clay pile material. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing though. Good relaxation from the Soho period. Disgrace that they couldn't think of anything to put it before.
