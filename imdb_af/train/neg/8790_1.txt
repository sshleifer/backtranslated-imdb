I recently saw it on cable and enjoyed it. I read the comments here and it looks like everyone from the second half holds over the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too badly, it's not extended.) The second story, I thought, was clicked. And that "California Dreaming," if I hear it again ... Chungking Express is good, but it's not something that mainstream audiences will see, like "Crouching Tiger."
