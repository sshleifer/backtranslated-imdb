Woody Allen made "September" and proved that even a genius could screw up. This is Mel Brook's "September". Monetically stupid, boring and rude, I must confess I didn't look it to the end. The movie is under the dishonest couple (eg "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") who made me sleep or forced me to reach the "rewind" button. And I am sorry to say this as a dedicated Mel Brooks fan. He has to stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. How the same man who made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" can eliminate such a dog is beyond me. To be avoided at all costs.
