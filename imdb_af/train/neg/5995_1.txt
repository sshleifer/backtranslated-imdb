It's a really horrible movie. What they did was take a TV program, which was never aimed at young children and gave it the George Lucas treatment (it ruined it by chattering to address the younger audience). <br /> <br /> OK so Thunderbird's TV show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows, but it was quite formal, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the models were blown up) and the voice was not bad. <br /> <br /> It suffers from bad decisive and bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker, which seems to be the only role players to get an idea of ​​how their characters should be played) After this travesty I would not allow Frakes direct traffic. <br /> <br /> The whole point of Thunderbirds was that it's about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or saving those involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give it one out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
