The makers of this film have created a future where not only abortion and birth control are illegal in every state, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences. In other words, this movie is every liberal worst nightmare! political agenda is so hard here and the style of the film is so low that it just loses steam quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, I would recommend moving it.
