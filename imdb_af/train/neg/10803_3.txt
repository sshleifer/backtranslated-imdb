OK, so after watching this refreshing movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes of my life here is the basic summary: Genius comes from a ghetto tree cabinet, gives this kid with rough hair 3 wishes, the child wastes his wishes I forget what Shaq sucks to pick up, and I think so. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I laughed, I cried ...... but especially I laughed at the horrific comedy that came from the amazing acting of a nba player / rapper and boy with rough hair . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for college kids who drink a bit of beer with their good friends. <br /> <I'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 just b / c the movie is based on 3 magical wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, it would be to erase this horrible movie. and for everyone to pretend that Hollywood is not wasting money to make it.
