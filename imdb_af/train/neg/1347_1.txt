Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon. I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series, as well as 1992's Christmas Special Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas. Some Gadget fans are quickly criticizing the second season (1985) of the show, but they have to compare it with DiC's 2002 edition of "Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge". Then they will find the second season as absolute gold. . <br /> <br /> As a Gadget fan, I couldn't get the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that wasn't Gadget Boy related. I bought the movie, and I swore to myself that I would be objective; I knew sometimes that artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I wasn't even prepared for what I was about to watch. <br /> <br /> There was hardly a pinch of the original display still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief list of just a few of the disadvantages for this movie: * The humor is not made up of the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (originally an almost equal part in the series as Gadget) lacks the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * The original music by Saban & Levy is not there, and the score is subpar. (Understand that Saban now has his own production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saving Christmas" has good music, even without Saban.) * Don't expect Gadget's gadgets to see what made the show so engaging, like gadget -Copter, gadget goggles, gadget mallet, gadget jacket (actually used, but it wasn't even called the same thing), as well as its standard other hat and hand gadgets. In this movie, his gadget feet were telescopes instead of feathers. These kinds of things make true spectators of the show, and are simply not needed to change. <br /> <br /> * The original range gadgetmobile is now a fast, so-called "hip" convertible. All the fans of the original series enjoy the gadgetmobile that converts into the gadget of and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Head Quimby is now very short-lived and even Gadget. He was always uncle in the original series, but it pushed the situation a bit. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Are there any positives on this movie? ? OK, go here ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby points to a real villain from the cartoon: the Great Wambini (classic second-season "Gadget" villain pronounced by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you're not lucky. Life is about choices and living through the choices. Most situations in life have a purpose, even if it is a lesson. The lesson learned here: stick to the original formula! "If it's not broken, don't fix it." True Gadget fans must be removed from this movie; You will surely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 edition of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1", which contains the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true Gadget fan, lover of 80's animation and many of DiC's programs, I urge you to buy "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs that are excellent and secure to bring back good memories.
