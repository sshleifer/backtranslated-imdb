"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) gathers a group of high school for a reunion at the cabin where his twin brother West has been missing. While there, a reptile creature awaits in the shape of a man (reminds me of the Gillman of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) in the desert the right time to choose them one by one. A biker, Ellen Ripley-type female bad-ass, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker using his experiments, while also serving as a security spot for the thing on the bloody rampage. Kat knows more than she tells (she also suffered a child's loss), but there is another novelty button that most of the group has no idea. This creature may be more human than they realize. And it's the former identity that sheds some light on a deception, just one other person has been hiding since West's death. Cat holds the key to many of the mysteries that are unlocked, as the group stays near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Luckily, much of the movie stays away from the creature that jumps in the air as we also see a dim screen when we look through the eyes. The movie features Dawson's Creek-type melodramatics that often prevent any real tension that has to build in a little monster film. The direction is very dirty, resulting in a relatively dull experience, rather than scary. The role play is quite lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (The FOG remake) can be the only draw for this movie.
