When I decided to watch the BARBARANE, with those twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it couldn't be that bad because the movie was directed by Ruggero Deodato. He has a reputation for making sleazy movies, but played well. Well, the BARBARANE is remarkably trashy action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and fails at every level. The appearance of the movie is wrong. Some scenes are well shot, but the tone and the skintzy, sticky "disco" look of the clothes and hair people are decorated. It just makes no sense, even for a low budget slip like this. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdresser and costume. He's supposed to be threatening, but he comes across as a buffoon. And it's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first movie and walk around in a slim fur bikini. I'm sure she wants this drink to disappear from the earth! The so-called Barbarian twins are good as the muscle-bound heroes, but it is almost impossible to make a proper criticism of their acting because their roles, like all the others in this mess, are really poor. The only way the film tries to distinguish one twin from the other is to wear one twin, wear a ribbon cloth covering his ass, while the other twin's runner barely covers his muscle. I'm not joking! Don't ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato really had to be desperate to agree to make this movie. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this trashy flick. It's just bad.
