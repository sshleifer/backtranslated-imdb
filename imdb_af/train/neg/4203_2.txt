What starts out as a pretty clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company is almost instantaneously turning into an uninteresting and utterly ominous murder mystery. David Arquette and the wonderful Stanley Tucci are trying very much to see this train wreck, but some things are just not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What causes, for example, that Gale suddenly comes from a lovely maternal figure to a drunk climber at Tommy's parents' home? Why would Heinrich, though, destroy a sleighbag, the business he spends his life by robbing and possibly killing his clients? Why does apparently sensible Tommy believe Heinrich can be a murderer (which is almost entirely based on a dream), and even if it was credible, why wouldn't he go to the police? And why didn't Gale trigger the alarm when she got home, especially after shaking Howie? Of course, all these events are needed for the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely) to unfold. And it can be forgiven if it even resulted in the slightest bit of comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his date rape, to the wrong identification of Gale, to the final "joke" about Gale and Howie still dead, is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I checked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing else I or anyone else can do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.
