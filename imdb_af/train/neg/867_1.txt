I had quite high expectations for this movie, although it had a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant and sat throughout the film. I felt rather sick. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not in the least fun or particularly sensitive to tasteless theater, I both enjoy Woody Allen's everything you ever wanted to know about sex. . "and Michael Hanneke's" Funny Games "- I found the director's obsession with this ten-year-old who wants to drink women's milk completely sickly. And when the film climbed into an "orgy", where the boy both drank his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he'd listened to for the whole movie, I almost lifted up the total perversion and sentimental poppy is. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European films, as well as independent movies, so this movie really enjoyed me. Avoid this movie at all costs, it must be rejected after the annals of History as a lesson in a bad theater.
