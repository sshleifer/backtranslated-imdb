I didn't really know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (hype about Satanism, etc.) and the trailers in the last movie I saw look pretty interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? Not my idea of ​​a good fright and honest, I just felt as if I was watching a very good, terrifying movie, not a detached religious farce trying to get cheap excitement, through a few chick flies every couple get minutes! <br /> <br /> I'll try to keep away from the spoilers (!), but I found it very strange that an atheist who gets a string of rose beads from a deceased priest suddenly comes with Christ's wounds can end (is not stigmata supposed to be deeply religious ??) I mean, she is hanging out with losers, doing looser things, acting like a typical rebel et al, and here showing the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! <br /> <br /> Scenes of her crucified, thrown back, shouted, blood everywhere, became quite boring after seeing a dozen times. It wasn't scary or scary, just repulsive. However, it became very painful to watch - the flickering scenes were extremely annoying. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If your Catholic, don't see it. If you are not, it still does not see.
