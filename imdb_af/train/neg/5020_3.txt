This is the most wasted access on IMDb that I still have to stumble upon. All the previous judges act like this is the movie. This is NOT the movie. On the contrary, it's just a featuret that is an extra on the DVD of the movie "The One". It's also not near the 90 minutes it is mentioned here. In fact, it is barely 13 minutes from how cool Jet Li champion can do. and his reflections on the movie. So yes this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar. Don't listen to any of the other reviews because they are ALL mistakes. You can trust me because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> And that's the truth. I think you can say I'm the "One One" Judge that matters.
