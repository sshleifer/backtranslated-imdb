I estimate this movie with 3 skulls, but only the girls knew how to shout. It could have been a better movie if the actors were better. The twins were OK. I believed they were evil, but the oldest and youngest brother. Very badly sucked, they seemed to read the scripts instead of doing them ... spoiler: if they are vampire, why do they freeze the blood? vampires cannot drink frozen blood. The sister in the movie says we drink her while she lives. But when they go to another home, they take a cooler than their frozen blood. end of spoiler <br /> <br /> It was a big waste of time, and it hurts me, I read all the reviews of how this movie was, how many awards this movie won, and this movie was f * ** * ing s ** t !!!!
