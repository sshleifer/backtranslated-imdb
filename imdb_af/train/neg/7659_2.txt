Alone In The Dark is a BAD movie and bound with Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish it was ALL I had to say, but of course the IMDb determines a word count and everything. <br /> <br /> I'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. A low budget drink like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a big budget shame like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director doesn't have an idea. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, money-grabbing idiot who just doesn't care about his audience. <br /> <br /> It is more shocking if you think that Uwe Boll (The mastermind behind this shocking crap and though some real rubbish under his belt) has created something that happens only once in a blue moon . The really horrible bad horror movie. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, crazy random camera cuts and terrifying soundtrack. Alone In The Dark is a horrible movie that nobody should ever watch. Woo hoo! Review about. Give me a button, roll in 2006 and may I never talk it again. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie.
