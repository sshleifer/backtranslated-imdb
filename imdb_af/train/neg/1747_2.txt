Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) characters are not properly built until Mac's boss decides to dress him with three air vows. . The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Oom Mambo (Paresh Rawal) handle situations that are sometimes forced. <br /> <br /> About the film, Paresh Rawal, is a very talented actor, I thought it was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerant, John Abraham is very bad, stuck over furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is sometimes funny, but in all a DUD (songs are boring) and a lead role if you hope for healthy entertainment and comedy.
