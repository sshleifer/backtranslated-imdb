It is curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a few movie stars who entered the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and both went into the production end of the thing and the magnate status on the small enjoy screen. Lucille Ball, however, was not a big star, it would come with television. As for Dick Powell, he didn't want to make films like Meet The People anymore and his career would come in his next film. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell did the movie was because a Young MGM player was thrown in a specialty number and he saw her at the time. His private time with June Allyson was much better than we see on the screen. Powell looks bored and can not call any kind of emotion. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of doing these musical instruments with stupid plots, the kind he ran from Warner Brothers. The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revue and it ran on Broadway for 160 appearances in the 1940-41 season. When MGM bought it, they deleted everything but the title and title song. The rest of the score is merged with several and different songwriters. None of the songs is unforgettable. Strange when you think some of the source material is from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen, and Rodgers & Hart. These guys just had to empty the trunk for empty material. <br /> <br /> The plot is cleaner than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the author of a revue called Meet The People and he is a site worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, they are both interested in the revue, but creative differences naturally keep them to the final. It's the movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> MGM has given Powell and Ball some good music acts, the main reason for watching Meet The People. The big groups of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the movie is Bert Lahr dressed in a commodore's suit as Lou Costello had in the dream order in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho was written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number of The Wizard Of Oz. And as everyone around the world saw that movie, you have an idea of ​​Heave Ho's like. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet, in which he eventually offered a not so pleasant worship. musicals. And Lucy will have to wait for television before the world has to see what she really can do.
