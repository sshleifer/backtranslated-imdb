I'm a big Charlton Heston fan. He is without a doubt one of the best actors of all time, but what did he think when he made this movie. Usually, if he has made a bad movie, I can blame it on the author or director, but in this case it is him. The suction of this movie is all his fault. It proves that Heston can't even make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze party and I will never get that time again. This is by far the WORST Heston movie I've ever seen. If you're a Shakespeare fan, you'll entertain this movie, but if you don't waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
