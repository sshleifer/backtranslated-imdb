This movie was different because it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes I used to see. But it does not change the fact that it is completely missing a storyline. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves on the screen, since black gay characters are rarely seen, and when they are the characters, they are usually not fully developed. But how difficult it would have been for the writer to actually start a story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that is focused. There really isn't a point on this movie, and even though it's a low budget movie, it's not yet an excuse for the lack of story or plot.
