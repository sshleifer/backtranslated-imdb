Usually I have much better things to do with my time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I registered with IMDb for an hour to get it out of my chest. <br /> <br /> You'd think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet. Well, this movie was just awful. It is nowhere impossible to suspend unbelief; I really tried to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just didn't want to allow me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake must stick to music, which has a terrible performance - NO presence as an actor, NO character. Can't blame everything on Justin: The movie also boasts a terrible plot and poor timing; this is definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I wonder what actress really motivates. I mean, Morgan did read the script before he took part. Didn't he see how poor it was? What can motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting is more about who you are seen, rather than developing really good work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a good actor; He gets much more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to talk to the poor writing. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience is going to say, "What's the hell going on? You expect me to believe this crap?" In short, except Justin, a huge series of badly executed - very disappointing.
