Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. A better-sounding wolf-like movie that I acknowledged started slowly, but got momentum on the road to get a pretty good finish, and the anchor woman just changed into a nice weather wave to be shot on the camera. Yes what made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure ... well, forget about it all since this movie has nothing to do with that movie. Oh yes, they make it clear that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something wants to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they are going from the small, cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where their evil wizards have to fight werewolves or something. I often wonder what Christopher Lee did in this movie in the world, but I read the trivia here, saying he was never in a werewolf, but read the script before playing. Perhaps you could have gotten in a US Werewolf in London a hell that might have been. It was definitely in London. Quite a few werewolves don't look much in this movie, except for a little bizarre and long sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie was for me when one gallant started talking aloud and one's ear's ear started to bleed.
