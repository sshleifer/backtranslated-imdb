Tony Scott destroys anything that has been interesting in Richard Kelly's clicked, patchy, overwhelming script. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that threw out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "kind of". <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not much of a story and Scott's extreme graphic styling of every shot serves as a distance mechanism. This makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's. chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just don't care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as a huge, cynical brat who has done nothing to justify our respect. She beats people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation asks, but she's not the least bit, and Knights aren't the least convincing either. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It's also loud and with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard long ago. The last twenty minutes is a poor repetition of Scott's "True Romance" climax with Domino's gang, which will meet two surprisingly bad guys that are a surprise! surprise! - destined to shoot it on top of a casino in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting firefighting is totally mumbled by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, useless exercise in celluloid masturbation. It is not an artistic brave or experimental piece; It is a failure at every level, as it does not give us an access point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good like a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears in the background as the "story" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassment and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the movie of the movie, with a gym. It's still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.
