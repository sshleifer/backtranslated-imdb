I admit that after about 30 minutes I had to progress through this poorly-transferred DVD - nothing happened, and everyone has already described the "plot". But did someone mention the opening scene - a butcher's knife is stabbed by a wig and it is glued onto the grass in the front yard! I guess the freaky kid did it, saying it was never explained. Really trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I wish it was a better written or thought-out movie, because what we left behind was beautiful and a movie that didn't make sense was not a "smart" movie . , it's just a poorly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a tidy version and if there was any missing footage, I'd like to see if it will help. Otherwise, it's a weird little movie that is best if you go fast!
