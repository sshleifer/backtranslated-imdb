I look around in the video store, still in shock, how Steven Seagal with his record of bad action movies can still hit 3 movies on the shelves in less than a year. The 3rd power has not been attributed the first time in the Sci Fi Genre for our ever increasing Seagal. Visits of bad movie entertainment flash before my gullible eyes. This is not the case, one thing with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come. <br /> <br /> Seagal is recovering a little with the Trashy but enjoyable Shadow Man the last time we saw him. Anyway, the attack force must be its absolute worst movie ever! Don't argue for a Kill, Ticker or even Black Dawn people. This is the bottom of the Septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says it's Steven Seagal's return to form must be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent. I'm a tall bad ass again. Lawson wants revenge for killing his team leading him to a disgraceful plot to spread a very bad drug to the unsuspecting public. Not to mention the dealers are not from here. <br /> <br /> The whole production of directing to the acting is poor. Was this movie shot in the Dark? It has to be the worst light movie since Howling 2. The action is terrible and done very badly. <br /> <br /> The producers also unknowingly decided to do what the fans hate the most: throw stunt double after stunt double and terribly Steven Seagal. Can you give him shame? <br /> <br /> While saying that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie's (originally Harvester) was reported to be, and certainly better than the Attack Force. The post-production toddler no longer made it coherent and Seagal looked worse. I feel bad for director Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal pen as they will be judged forever for the untouched production repetitions. <br /> <br /> So Now It leaves Seagal in the impossible position to reconcile something to reconcile for this mess. But after seeing how bad the Attack Force turned out, do we really want to make him another movie?
