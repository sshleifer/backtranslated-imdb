Peter Fonda is as deliberately verified as an actor that his lachrymose line readings cancel any irony or humor in the dialogue. He traded sauce barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with diminishing hair; even his smaller touches (like a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face), do not reveal a character as much as an insecure actor directed by himself, an uncertain filmmaker. In the Southwest around 1950, a poor player (not a bit of fraud) wins a beloved, popular teen Lolita in a blocked poker game; After getting a treasure map with promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the turnout becomes twofold prospectors. Some stunning views, and a weird but interesting comedy by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man, are the only compensation in tired comedy drama. The two leaders are traced by cartoon-like murderers who will stop nothing until they take their hands. Shield is very beautiful, but - although the camera loves its beautiful, shiny beauty - she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no scope); Each time she opens her mouth, one tends to either cringe or duck. * 1/2 of ****
