Wow, could have been such a good movie. Get started with Brittany Daniels. I think cool, we're going to get a flash back, but nothing starts filming with the children's filming. This movie would probably have been better if it wasn't for the acting. I mean the acting was mostly terrible. Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with, they suspected they were doing the best they could. Really put it to me the role. The twins were the only ones who seem to have some acting skills. The movie dragged on for so long after the supposedly shocking conclusion. All in all, I saw worse low budget films, but it was hype with the 8 movies to die, because I was very disappointed. Incidentally, some reviewers said there were gore and things. I saw the same movie. Well, it's 4 out of eight, and so far only one thing is good.
