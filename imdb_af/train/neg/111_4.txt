My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to buy this video. Although it had great actors / actresses, there were just too many subplots that went on to keep interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just turned too much to be credible. I was disappointed with what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I will always love John Ritter in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.
