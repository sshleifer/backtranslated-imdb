Well, first this movie was pretty good, though it only moved fast and even though they only had a $ 60,000 budget, it was fine, but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might be murdered, why are you chasing him around and pulling a firearm on him with just one bullet and wasting it and ending up running from him, all slowing down and getting yourself killed? Plus, after you found your sister dead in the lake and got an idea and figured out who the murderer was, why not give the idea to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie when she was acting like her sister who was a waitress and she was talking to the bad guy, she had to meet him somewhere and record that she was dead and what 'proved' to her. I don't know I wasn't happy with the end. This movie could have been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the end wasn't that bad! Don't waste your money on this movie, because if you do, you'll also write a review here and won't be happy.
