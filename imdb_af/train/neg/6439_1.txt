Honestly, it's easy in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. Partly, because it takes itself so seriously, unlike regular light rubbish, this movie wants you to be emotionally involved, to feel for the characters and to care for the alleged conspiracy. None of these ever come close. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent and completely non-sensual plot. 2.) Annoying style-over-fabric "MTV" camera work. 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes. <br /> <br /> Allow me to expand. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when these movies were made, they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies, the stigmata or possession. So, guess what? They combined them! An Aetheist is owned by a dead person, who then exposes her the stigmata to expose a church conspiracy. How a regular person can surpass death and another person has his rose color is never explained or even spoken. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we are treated with screens of screaming things in loud voices, mapping cryptic messages on cars, and writing messages on walls. Apparently, this priest was also a violent man, because the injured young woman is also looking at one of the characters as he speaks in that clicked, loud "possession" that we have all already heard. It also starts in my second complaint, because when the young lady gets the stigmata, she also defends the center of gravity by drifting into the air and everything and everyone throwing her as if in an earthquake? Why is it happening? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director considered it "cool". <br /> <br /> 2.) These movies contain dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, from birds that appear nowhere and fly away, and most annoyingly, from water droplets. This woman's apartment is constantly drinking water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place will probably fall with these many holes. To summarize this complaint, to the end, and for absolutely no reason, cut the camera to drop water, slowly, in reverse direction !! WHY!?! I have no idea! It's not relevant to anything, and again betting is because the director thought it was cool. <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says he has become a priest to explain holes in science. It doesn't make sense to me. I would think it would be enough to go to church, but no, he has to go through the entire rigar school to become a priest. I just don't buy it. Secondly, there are many plot holes, some of which I will work out below. To begin with, once she gets the stigmata, the scene ends with her lying unconscious, bleeding. Next is the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is to the end the previously mentioned "scientific priest" character speaks to the spirit the girl owns. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" Not a word for the word quotation, but you get the idea. She replies? "You have no faith, no doubt!" That's why he has an aetheist! An Aetheist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then there is the fact that the object of this film's conspiracy, this lost gospel (from St Thomas, I believe) is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to suppress this document, but you can go to a bookstore and buy it. Perhaps it is supposed to be in an alternative history, where it is not widely known, but the movie never tries to tell us about it, or even to show that it is an alternative event of discovery of the document. <br /> Finally, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. This is my arch-nemesis, which I need to insult every chance I get. I'm making it wrong. Final Degree: F
