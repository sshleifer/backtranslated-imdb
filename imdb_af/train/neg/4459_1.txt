I'm not saying this because the production values ​​were so low, but because they were terribly filmed. The girl's shot was her hair in the creek? Do we really need to sit there for an elongated shot and see how she does it in the same place for 5 minutes? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. You could hardly see anything and when the characters spoke, you could hardly hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course, I haven't skipped most of it, and I don't want to hear anyone saying I should first look at the whole thing to judge it. This film is so poorly done and performed that even by independent and low budget standards it is just awful. Awful movie ... don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors' "funny" lines, it's because of how difficult the production is.
