This movie is made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I am not one of them. I think he's just a mimic that drives the Black Metal train (I'm generally not a fan of black metal). But when I wear this DVD cover to pay it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something, the more convincing it is. So I assumed I had a roller coaster ride of rubber gore, and do-it-yourself splash with a sinister backdrop. Now, that's what I do. <br /> <br /> I came home and built it. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWFUL camera work and QUALITY quality. And it was then (2002) that it looks like it was shot with a Hi8 video camera. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies will create a nice setting for this ... photo. <br /> <br /> After a few months I came back (in the vicinity) and saw half. Then not only did the mentioned issues irritate me. My aversion developed. I noticed how funny Dani (1,65m, 5'5 "height) looked in his platform shoes, tore a mosquito's head apart. (Yes, ripe. His head apparently had no skull.) I had also found that this movie may still have, I haven't completed it yet, so I wasn't positive. <br /> <br /> After a few more tries, I finally managed to finish this movie - A few months ago ... Yes, it took me 5.5 years.) Then - Dani was actually funny like Satan / Manson / the super-evil man's HELPER and the movie didn't make sense. bad person who uses Dani to do bad things Well, I think he's just very, very bad, in fact they are both and that's pretty much. <br /> <br /> We have a few short stories at Dani's character joins in. My favorite was about a man who stole someone's leg because he wants to use it as his own, yes exactly. <br /> <br /> The play's ROCK BOTTOM The CGI is the worst ever, and, son, is Stin ger's CGI baaaad.) The story has no meaning. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfactory. The only thing you can see is the unmotivated violence and gore. Blood and intestines are fairly well made. Why, you can actually see the movie coming up and then turning on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as it may be - and at least ... and then eats it out. Why? We never know. We know, though, that this cat should have been over illegal substances, because his heart is almost half its size.) <br /> <br /> You may think, to my mind that this movie is so bad, it's good, but it's just bad. Cradle or Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for gore.
