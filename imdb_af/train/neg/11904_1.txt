The end of violence and the Million Dollar hotel thought the Wenders lost their vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture. The land of abundance seals the coffin, I'm scared by being a big, unimaginable, naturally sentimental and clicked movie. The characters are completely flat and stereotyped, the writing, plot and direction are amateurish, at best. For the first time in a while I was impatient for the movie to end so I could continue with my life. The war-torn uncle's delirium, the patriotic summary that concludes in the air. It has become as simple and pathetic to me, almost the work of a filmmaker who has made some brave magic on the screen. What happened? The days of experimentation, remarkable writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him, I'm afraid. Let's hope he gets his inspiration again. At the Toronto Film Festival, where I watched the film, Wenders was there to introduce it. Totally lacking in humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I KNOW you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he can't be wrong anymore ...
