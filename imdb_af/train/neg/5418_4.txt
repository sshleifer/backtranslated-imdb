This movie is like the material S.E. Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola was screened in the early 80s, and if Trueblood was also a product, the results could have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a very bad-funny piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays former Trufflood Ray Trueblood, I'm probably the exact description. It was in the days of action flicks that guys used in their 40s and mid-30s and they dressed in gowns or some similar selection of gangsters and they fought to bad 80's music. Nevertheless, Ray is the only caretaker of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), which he is forced to leave inexplicably in a train station when he is in police time and forced to serve time in the Marines. Flash forward to this day and Ray is back in town looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, but in a gang that was Ray's opponent and now old scores have to be settled completely (and again, police must be evaded And this time, a lady's honor in the action movie defended her mind before Ray could keep his life with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the movie is very ridiculous. To me, this has to do with too much overworking, though not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress he loves. The guys in the gang and Lowe themselves look pretty unnecessarily exaggerated like New York Street Toughs. Though, the bigger suspension is recovering plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was beyond its prime as a product of 1989.
