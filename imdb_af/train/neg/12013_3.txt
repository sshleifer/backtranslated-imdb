I had to think that any movie with the Poltergeist lady in it would not be good. It actually starts out well, but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie in a movie. There are people sitting in a movie watching the movie. One girl in the audience was so annoying that I would turn around and curl up. A little weird, but far from good.
