As some of the other reviewers have indicated before, I would like to know what Moron read the script and went, "Yes! That's it. This is the next movie we go green!" And whoever that person is, should examine his or her head for the actual brain activity. Because everyone who is responsible for spending money to make it do after reading the script, I would like to give you my email address and maybe you just want to give more money. This movie is horrible in every way. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are funny, at least it can be. They have made some great movies and have amazing funny performances on the go. But here is not just the point of denying all logic. Not only is the play terrible, but the whole movie shot is not just as amateurish as you can from start to finish, but actually wants to pay you to watch this movie. Perhaps if it was free, it would be another waste of time. <br /> <br /> Usually, I would tend to write a long, winding, detailed review on why this movie is so bad, but just enough to say it makes my short talk. It's the lowest common denominator of the movie and it's about as immaterial as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 .. make my top ten list of the worst movies of all time!
