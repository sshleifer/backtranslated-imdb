What made the original Killer Tomatoes was that it was made by people with no budget who were only awake for a few days. <br /> <br /> It was something with a budget, but it was just not so much fun. John Astin of Adams Family celebrity is actually an attempt to be comedies, but he is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and unfunny gags. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides to place a prince on the throne of France. The hero, his French girlfriend and the Gizmo-like "Fuzzy Tomato" decide they will stop him ... <br /> <br /> Forget about video nonsense ...
