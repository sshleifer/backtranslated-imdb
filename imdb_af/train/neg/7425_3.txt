This tiring Las Vegas casino movie is almost impossible to watch and get involved. This is something you look at if you can do absolutely nothing better. The only two decent things in this movie are both attached to Stella Stevens and one spends the whole program hoping to fall from one of the skimpy tops she wears. Very big shots from the mid-70's Las Vegas (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashions of the day are also good for a giggle. Otherwise, a big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transmission, but even at less than $ 10 it's still not worth it in my humble opinion.
