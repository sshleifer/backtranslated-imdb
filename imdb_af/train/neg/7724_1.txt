To see all the negative reviews for this movie, I thought it could be another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listen to the generic dialogue that was terribly made by Lungren, and all the other initiated Eastern actors, and I found the movie so horrible that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee went into the story and the one-liners started flying, the plot fell apart, the writing writers started drinking and the movie carried it out, because it was in the worst action movie ever. <br /> <br /> Lungren's previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's movies, Seagal's movies, and Stallone's non-Rocky movies, feature this honor. This movie has the worst acting scene (watch Tia Carrere's face as she is in Dolph's scene, it's worth laughing), with the worst dialogue ever. (Brandon Lee's comment on small Dolph is the worst line ever in a movie). and the worst outfit in a movie (Dolph in full Japanese costume). Photo "Tango and Cash" with worse acting, meets "Commando," meets "Friday the 13th" (due to the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is many Jason Voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minutes a movie. br /> <br /> The good (it's not terrible) performances go to the bad guy (who is still constipated by his entire show) and Carrere (who somehow calls her 5 rules without breaking out) . Brandon Lee is just that Lungren's sidekick, and does a very terrible job. <br /> <br /> A terrible, horrible movie. Fear it and avoid it. However, if you look at it, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. Speaking of underwater shots, watch the lame water battle scene with the worst battle scene ever ending. This movie has every version of a bad battle scene for those with a short attention span and to fill in the flashes of nudity. <br /> <br /> A BAD BAD FILM !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
