Lillian Hellman's play, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, is a strange project to come out of the whimsical Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, who represents his Broadway role and won Oscar's best actor, plays an anti-Nazi German underground leader who fights the fascists, his American wife and three children across Europe before escaping into the state (via the Mexico border). They settle in Washington with the woman's rich mother and brother, although a shepherd's farm is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends a lot of time in the German embassy to play poker. This drama seems to be used forever to find its focus. And when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest, direct refugees who teach the undecided, chief-in-the-sand Americans how the world suddenly changed), it seems a bit pathetic - the viewer is literally placed in the family's place. Lukas has several speeches in the third law that undoubtedly won him the Academy Award, but for most of the picture, he seems to be few, but goes in and out, goes out, enters and leaves. As his spouse, Bette Davis doesn't like anyone else and her wide eyes work well, but the role doesn't leave her much color. Their children (all with diverse accents!) Are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role as a fit woman (and the dissatisfied texture she has communicated seems completely wrong). The intention here was to show us tastefully, tactfully just because one can be German from WWII, who doesn't make him a Nazi sympathizer. We'll get it in the first few minutes; The rest of this tasteful, tactile film is made up of exposition, defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion. It must be a hot mixture, but it is rather dry and inert. ** of ****
