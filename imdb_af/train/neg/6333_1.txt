I actually saw this movie at a theater. Once I gave the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard from a theater: "No refunds!" Once I heard those words, I just had to get used to my money and went home. But no, fool, I went in and watched the movie. This movie made no one in the theater love. Not once. Not even by accident! Mostly, we sat there in astonished silence. Every ten minutes or so someone will shout: "This movie SUCKS!" The audience will be enthusiastically applauded, and then put in a damn, bored silence for another ten minutes.
