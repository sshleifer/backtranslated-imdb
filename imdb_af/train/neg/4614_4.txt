This is an evil about how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's uncomfortable, or because the creative team's joint credentials really deserve to be earned, but because it's nominated in every category of Prizzi's Honor deviations. Some will argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost it at this point in his career, but I didn't buy it. Just last year, he signed the wonderful UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark character study in Mexico, which was among the best he ever did. Prizzi's Honor, on the other hand, a film loaded with strength, good intentions and a decent script, seems to be a great fallacy. <br /> <br /> The overall tone and intrigue of a gangster is in love with a female beatman prefigure the strange crimed media that Hollywood caught in the early 90's, but the writing is too random because, the motivation is off and the story is generally unclear about what exactly it is: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (a Brooklyn accent who works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing to Jack) and Kathleen Turner seems to be in the forefront of paycheck mode. sleep runs through some parts. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, compensates better, but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivation: she is the victim of her grandfather's contempt, she seems to be supportive of her ex-husband, then becomes a revenging bitch who want a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the movie have a rinsed quality as made in the early 70's and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything. There is a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director who is hungry to be recognized, it could have been something better, but what remains is like a movie that nobody really is interested in making. .
