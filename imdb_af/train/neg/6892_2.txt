Oh my goodness. It was a really big mess that just couldn't help itself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and doesn't plan to go anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman, Mert (Jeff Daniels), with whom she may marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been a good movie if Her not starting to make Jeffrey so annoying there is no chance of him and it just gets worse and worse. In the end we have to love him, but there was no reason, because he did not change the selfish brutes he was at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton doesn't seem to even try and is in a terrible shape after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where should they believe their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they are not very interested. Apart from a few little smiles, this movie really doesn't deserve a comedy, just because there is almost nothing to laugh at! Watching out for a recent Diane Keaton movie watching Mad Money of Smother is much better than this deadly attempt.
