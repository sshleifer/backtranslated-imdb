A fashion designer pulls over a cat and falls into a pool and hits her head on something floating on the surface. With quite casey effects (that was a TV movie) she drifted out of her body. She drifts through a tunnel of swirling orange smoke, and black rigid figures fall into her view (they look like the mannequins in her flat). I almost thought I was watching a Jess Franco movie. As her friends revive her, a black arm gets her wrist and she has to struggle to get loose. When she is revived, she remembers everything and she has a nasty bruise on her forearm. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, she almost touches an out-of-control car coming on the pavement behind her. On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for a holiday. When she gets there, she is surprised to find it is the Day of Death. They are irritated by another American tourist who follows them, and he almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who have had near-death experiences. They all experienced the tunnel, but not the black figures or the repeated near escaping from the dead. One of them, and he is very anxious. She is also encouraged to meet with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells her about people he calls "Walkers" (the name of the novel on which it was based). They were people who probably died of one cause, who, after being examined, died of a different cause. So it's as if they continue to walk around after they die until they're dead again, but he blames it on poor record keeping. <br /> <br /> I watched it on the 102 minute video, and it felt very long. I can't imagine there is a 192 minute version! Perhaps if it should be watched over two or more nights on TV, it would be better than watching one meeting. <br /> <br /> I only read one Gary Brandner novel, Floater, and if it is representative of his work, he is not the most original of writers. Floater has the general plot of: picked up on the child kills people in revenge. Even the variation was quite common: on a baby chosen people die and die years later in revenge from outside the grave. And it actually has a point in common with this movie, because the child is practicing astral projection, and when he drowns, he drives out of his body like he does. I don't know so well. From the Death of Night follows his novel Walkers. I understand that the Howling movies don't match much with his novels. <br /> <br /> This is quite a slow movie, and the special effects and movies are really captured by the (presumably) low budget and made for -TV shortcomings. There are many easily recognizable character elements in it. It also feels very dated, more early to mid-1980 than 1989. I found it boring. A much better low-budget movie on similar topics I don't think is so badly dated, Sole Survivor (1983) (probably the inspiration for the 2000 Final Destination movies). It blows away from the death of the night.
