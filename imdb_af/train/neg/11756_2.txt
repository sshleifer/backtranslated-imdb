Only children under the age of 12 should be allowed to watch this movie. The rest of us should take a book, MP3 player, or just a nice nap to endure the experience of this event. It can best be summed up as an "inflated" TV movie broadcast in theaters. Children will want to watch this movie, and they will enjoy and be entertained by the movie.
