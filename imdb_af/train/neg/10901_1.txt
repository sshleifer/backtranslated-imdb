And some more "no" s up there. Voodoo Academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is it trying to do? Tell a story? Of course not; As noted, most of them are just scarce legal guys rubbing themselves. Could it be an attempt to have subversive homosexuality? Well, maybe, if not, it never goes beyond the most innocuous and non-threatening forms of male contact. (That's to the delight of no one, repeat about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's kind of a horror movie; are we trying to scare us? Not unless the director intended to do so by the extreme stage and turmoil of his "work". <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I enjoyed a movie less. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's like the Voodoo Academy uses the genres of horror, zombie and gay movies, puts it in a grinding wheel and passes it through a coffee filter. Just instead of being the kind of coffee filter that wipes coffee beans, it's the kind that makes everything important, edgy or in any way interesting. The result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water - without the ability to hydrate you after the 10-day greed that will inevitably overtake you when you see this horror of human effort.
