There are very few films in the USA about Rome that did not occur in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme, making it difficult to get into Roman history. (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and got some resistance in Hollywood because it didn't have Jesus in it). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one photo not just for Caesar and Christ, but was established when Rome was only one city on the Italian peninsula and only the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic . <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical movie; It's peplum, and while the production values ​​are not rock-bottomed, the acting and characterization are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was in Italian, but with wood-English dubbing it is a lot of champion. I first laughed a few good things out of it. <br /> <br /> I didn't see many movies of this genre because I missed most of the 60's Hercules movies. It is amusing to a point, but as the movie goes on, it gets a little boring. <br /> <br /> One thing's for sure: if I saw this movie when I was ten, I'd have loved It. At that age I went there with Romans and swordsmen. At least this brought this baby back.
