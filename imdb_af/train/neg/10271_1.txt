This movie had to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The play was horrible, terrible and cheesy and talks about a predictable plot! I will never see this movie again, nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! Only when the movie started did I realize how I got myself into it. All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and they all counted in this one movie. The prank phone calls, Halloween night, a psycho and a knife! It's absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for making the movie, it is very hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so good and so scary. I mean, how do you realize that the movies are a cheap rip off of "Scary Movie"? At least a few good actors get there and then it may have been a good horror movie.
