It is unlikely that anyone except those who worship silent movies will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and a busy (but exhausting) background score going to this 1933 edition. Although sound is widely used in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman who is unhappy, who tells her husband to a younger man after a romantic break in the forest. destroyed. <br /> <br /> The brightest photographed scene gave the jealous man a lift to the young man for a ride in town, and continues to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. In a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at the highest speed to a railway crossing, but changes his mind at the last moment and loses his nerve. This is probably the most stress-filled scene in the otherwise definitely slow-delayed and naturally confronted story. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR has been given the kind of post-treatment Marlene Dietrich has discovered by her, but her beauty has not yet been refined by the beauty men as they were when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance mostly consists of the sadness and grief while grieving the loss of her marriage with only short smiles when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), the attractive young stud that takes her clothes to a naked swim. <Br /> <br /> The swimming scene is very short, strategically photographed, and not worth the whole heat it apparently generated. The love-making scene, later, was also artificially photographed with the kind of lyrical photography that is visible in most of the movies - artfully so. More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism - and this is the kind of thing others have that preach the movie is a kind of lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Not so. It is disappointing, primarily roughening in its healthy portions (including the troublesome symphonic music in the background) and definitely me. Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer has seen the film and has given her a career in Hollywood. He had seen something in her work that I didn't do. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is a silent movie with the camera doing all the work. The frightening "workers" scene is going on for too long and it's an engaging intrusion where nothing is needed. It fails to end the movie on the right note.
