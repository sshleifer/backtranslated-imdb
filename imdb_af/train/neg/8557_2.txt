I admire Kissing on the Mouth for his openness ?? haircut and masturbation, especially from head / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to give truth to everyday "private" incidents. Unfortunately, the movie falls under the 'The Brown Bunny' empire, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it does reflect 'Bunny' with a lot of nothing going on, or too much cinematography shots (or sincerely fussy) on absolutely nothing? feet, hands or genitals. Again, I can unfortunately see why this movie is released, and why people rent: real life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was a total waste of time. We quickly learn about a post-college male-and-female roommate in which the man has a clear feel for the woman who sees him as a friend, while constantly having sex with her boyfriend. Other than that, we are subject to the everyday events of their boring lives: its work for her parents; He is working on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. To make all this work, the dialogue must be interesting and the acting real. Not working, and it's so boring that someone looks for an hour's drive, that is, 'The Brown Bunny'. The only actor who stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she does some dubious acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a microphone is actually worth watching or listening.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, to take care of it all and not be afraid to expose themselves or shower habits not, but the film falls flat. It has stories that do not fit on the scenes, too much boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, except the soft porn factor, why you hired it.
