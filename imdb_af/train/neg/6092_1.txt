Someone had to joke when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> First, it is an absolute impossible that this movie was made in 1993. The fashions and music determine that it's 80's serious. My guess is that it has long been on the shelf before an angry distributor picked it up and released it to an unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> There's a plot. Kind of. A strange loner meets an eternal man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite song, he will be able to change who he chooses. At this point, I feel compelled to point out that the payer's favorite song is the London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is it his favorite song? Because he's an idiot. We are only a minute in the movie and even though the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity. It even gets stupid. <br /> <br /> The resident is the nostril voter. I can only assume this, since there are two scenes in the film where he is seen choosing his nose. This explains the title. He decides to change to a girl so he can get close to other girls. And kill them. It's more or less. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally frightening. Every single performance in this movie sucks. In fact, I will go so far as to say that the play is the standard of a pornographic movie. It's really so terrible. The nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker. The characters in the movie see him as the girl he became by singing the London Bridge is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot, even typing it. Anyway, it's a kind of strange to see a middle-aged weirdo hanging out with schoolgirls. And not in a good way. There is even an extensive montage of scenes where the nostalgia is at the girls at school and playing a song over it. It is probably the worst song ever recorded. I'm not even going to describe it. You will know it when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are certain scenes of violence, sure. And there's a Benny Hill style sequence in a transsexual. There is even an immortal little dialogue, which may or may not have been taken by Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostrils voter for a prostitute says, "I have cash if you have the gash." Beautiful, I'm sure you agree. <br /> <br /> Full nonsense.
