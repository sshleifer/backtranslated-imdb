Well, I finally saw it. I didn't go when it first came out, because frankly, I was scared. Afraid of how bad it can be or how disappointing it is. While not as bad as Menace and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits, it was a movie experience I will never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm boy who just knows he's meant for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil threat while being taught by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic enlightenment - all in a space-opera setting. <br /> <br /> It's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. This is an old formula exactly because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special. <br /> <br /> Then came the Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie points of all time. The big villain, Father, was Luke's father. Wow, nobody saw it. Of course I am convinced that Lucas did not appear in the script. Go back and look at Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in light of the first three episodes, see if it really does. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie - great effects, lots of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie lives or dies on its plot - the story it tells. Oh, definitely, really good acting can save a bad plot, but a bad plot along with bad acting. This is a burden that no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I am forced to realize that George Lucas is. has managed to target some of the worst performances of some very good actors in their careers - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * The storyline. Oh me. Understand, he is already disabled by what happened in the first two movies, so this is an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have the bare absurdities of the background. We found Anakin as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virgin, miracle birth - the "chosen one". Well, this detail is never explained remotely. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's perception that they might be wrong. Oh yes, okay. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, this same wunderkind seems to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence this is. And he'll come back to Tatooine and never know he's from there? Wow! What about it. Test the old willing suspension of unbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we've got this brittle child, moody, thriving, young young adult, somehow becoming one of the greatest villains in film history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - the good guy who comes from grace, first to reach salvation in the end. <br /> <br /> How, pray tell, does it happen? Why did he have a dream that his wife would die during childbirth? Now he surely lives in a dying civilization that treats gravity, as we treat petrol, but it happens to the "dark one to be" to perhaps go with a doctor, because perhaps, perhaps, this futuristic society might do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think of is killing some kids because the bad man at the root of all the evil they've been shooting for two movies told him he had the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course he does. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to see and move such folly? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him, not because he was angry, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Amidala eventually dies. At birth. Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor, who is a dream and herself who points to the incredibly high technology that this society has advanced, only concludes that she has lost the will to live. Well, oh, okay, of course she did. Maybe it finally got her what she slept with her. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all of these things. He knows about the birth of Luke and Leia. Know who their father is and know what happens to them. Also know the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, over the course of a few years, as Luke reaches humanity and finds 3PO and R2, it's remarkable that 3PO's thoughts are wiped out, but not R2's - why ??? with the mention "I think this droÃ«s belongs to you ", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol wreck was built by the one he believed to be the" chosen "and apprentice to the emperor himself, and who only built on this whole planet, says:" odd, do not remember anything possessing droids ". <br /> <br /> Oh, good sadness. <br /> <br /> Lucas made it easy while he went along. As soon as he introduced Vader as Luke's father, the story unfortunately began to get out of control because he didn't know what the story was. The plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine made any sense of rationality. And nothing of this is in the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a memory, and it seems. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun movie to watch, but totally forgotten. Star Wars will be in my mind forever. Fortunately, this one, and the two that precede it, will soon fade away.
