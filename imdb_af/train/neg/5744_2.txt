This movie was horrible, simple set. It was so bad that I was registered with IMDb to warn you of his dangers. <br /> <br /> I'm a champion horror movie expert, per se. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of the Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my shock. And I know this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the movie is scared of people walking from one side of the screen to another. When they are not running, they spray non-sequitur lines, without emotion or motivation. When the actors become acceptable, the direction falls. There were so many shooting low-angle shots; I thought Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tripod. He uses what I call the "Leif Maneuver" several millions of times: it is to zoom out of an object of interest like an amateur. Apparently, the film staff can't get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset ... and played it the other way around. With this lazy direction, you're actually impressed with the final gory scene. The only thing you can see is that the last five minutes before the first eighty-five minutes have been filmed. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the base "Dead Alive." If you're a jerk and are looking for a challenge, "Darkness" gives a chance. <br /> <br /> Movie Quote <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's Dead!
