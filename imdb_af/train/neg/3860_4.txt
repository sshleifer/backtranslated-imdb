I'm not a big fan of rom / coms at the best times. A few were pretty good (look at the Dream for an Insomniac), but this one is just the same, but less. <br /> <br /> With a running time of 100 minutes, I expect more than one laugh every 30 minutes. The only true stomach laugh is when male strangers and friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> All I can say is avoided. I guarantee there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that will earn you $ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (And just like I'm a big Lee fan)
