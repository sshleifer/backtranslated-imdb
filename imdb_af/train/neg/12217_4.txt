As low-budget Indians go, you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say, I didn't pay much for "Frightworld". <br /> <br /> Author / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a murdered series of murderers. Not a bad point of departure, but done with a lack of low budget errors. The camera works trying to beat the audience, using continually shaky cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing greedy or scary to show us. It is clear from the bat, as we are introduced to the killer, and soon realize that the (acting) is the frightening thing that is happening. After a painfully long title order we are brought back to modern times the acting remains the same. "Frightworld" generates some, quite unique, cinematography when viewed from inside the fun house, but with a very long running time it can't save the movie. It is below average in hell. <br /> <br /> There is some mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the economy for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> Fans of really bad B-movies can find something of interest here, otherwise it won't spend a lot of cash.
