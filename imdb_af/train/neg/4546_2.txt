I just saw this movie and didn't read the book. The good thing about the movie is that on some parts it reminds you of the spiritual subject, evolution, synchronism and your sharing in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the film's immersion is easily broken. and there is very little report between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book is losing much in this movie version. The events that are supposed to cause synchronization are almost unrecognizable. Much of the reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene is coincidental, and even more to think that it has something to do with a greater purpose. <br /> <br /> Lighting settings are visually poor and do not create the better feeling it is supposed to. Do you remember the relief with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, it's nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. There are many scenes that really do not develop the story and also do not create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The better actors in this movie, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can't save it. The first two were given more scenes than their characters were trying to save the movie, and because they were paying more, but it didn't work. Most of the screens aren't really needed and don't help the story. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in his screens and sells as an evil man (as always), but the writing doesn't help him at all. The scene where he first tried to convince John (Matthew Settle) is not bad writing. Performing the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly executed. The flashbacks throughout the movie can't even be commented on. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a great time, read the book! I didn't read it, but it's probably a billion times better than that. It must be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
