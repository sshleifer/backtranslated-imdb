This movie starts slowly, then tapers off. After watching about an hour and seeing nothing, I walked. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people we know of. The producers of this film can be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a "motion" photo. There is no motion. I could have told the same story with some pictures with captions. The writing is a joke. It's just terrible. I doubt any doctor in the world can save it. My biggest regret is that I wasted 60 minutes of my life seeing "love in the time of money" but that I had a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I looked at about 20 people ahead of me.
