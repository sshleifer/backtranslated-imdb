Unfortunately, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was 42nd Street. I then expected all his stuff to be so good. I realized it wasn't necessarily the case, even here, with my all-time favorite classic era actor James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, the music numbers at the end are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like a lot of others and quite tiring. They always seem to be screaming, unlucky show producers. In this movie it is Cagney who wakes up so quickly that he gives me a headache and his character is thin. Quickly! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are close to "42nd Street" class, songs you can cover years and years - decades, I have to say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, it's one of the few early Cagney movies - and Berkeley movies - I don't quite like it and was very disappointed with how I was watching.
