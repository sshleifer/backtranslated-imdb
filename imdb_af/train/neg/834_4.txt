I found it a total waste of time, effort and money. I know Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making straight-to-video movies - but the plot of the original "new perspective" movie released the original movies with new animation and new songs and called it " a "new version of the movie that we all love." Nathan Lane comes back surprisingly to his role as Timon. Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original "Lion King" begin on a story journey to tell us the original story how it really happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, Yadda Yadda Yadda, Blah Blah Blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical rows are lame and the animation is a crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane in something of true commercial content? Overall, if you like the original, you will hate it. It is insulting because it is unfair to children and adults. And sum it up.
