This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy films that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and that's the bad one. Apparently, all his energy went into "Nemesis", which was an entertaining non-stop stock movie, and had a much more expensive look. "Knights" are clunky and cheesy, a sci-fi at stake, which looks too often like a video game (new opponents appear all the time and need to be wiped out as soon as possible). The only thing that beats this movie is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undoubtedly a brutally effective machine. As far as Kris Kristofferson is concerned, eight of his time (58), I hope his stunt was paid double. (* 1/2)
