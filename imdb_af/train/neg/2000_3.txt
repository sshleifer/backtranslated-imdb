I found the pace to be glacier and the original story brought about the content. My wife slept most and I didn't try to wake her up because I felt she had lost nothing. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson enter the house and possibly get caught, it is unclear how they can hide all their access and burglary tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door to the study was closed, so that the servants did not enter. <br /> <br /> The thing that made me confused was right at the end when there was a glint in the broken law. I have no idea what it was supposed to represent.
