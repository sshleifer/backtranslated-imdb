I have read some of the other comments and I have to agree with those who did not get the end. I thought it was going well. To the end. It made your mind run and then splat. I didn't know what the last few minutes of the movie had been, except a complete mess. It's like they ran out of money to make a good end so they improvised. First, they had a mysterious thing to make people disappear, then they had a man talking about Area 51 (who reminds you of strangers) and then they cut it. I thought the actors and actresses played well. It's just the script. Anyway, if you watch this movie, be ready to be disappointed.
