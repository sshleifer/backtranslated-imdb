I first saw this movie in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply published by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in full form. And so what? The plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic disaster and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong, straight and fundamentally serious women. The men are now trying to fight it, and then the whole lot of extremely stupid clich√©s - sex drives, constant male desire for sex, feminists who are shown as complete idiots (you may agree with them or not, but idiots definitely not), and so on. The show even by the stars Jerzy Stuhr is here and strangely bad - he just pulls off unsuitable faces and repeats the words like "I'm in the lift with a naked chick and I didn't do anything to her!". It was meant to be a comedy, but it seems to be a fleeting farce, full of predictable jokes and under-the-middle. Don't waste your time - it's just bad.
