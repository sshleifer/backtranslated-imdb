Anything that might have been interesting in this material was sunk in the first few seconds, with an indemnity that the events we are about to see will never be known and "It's the whisper of Hollywood 's most sensational "mysteries." <br /> <br /> Good, so we get nothing new (and E! S "Mysteries & Scandals" give you a better foothold on the particular incident ... and it's not much of an endorsement.) What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents, no big news there, more interesting, we learn what an excited director is prepared for to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and / or political establishment, asking whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks of his own experience through these characters, but what is said is so cynical and ugly and confused, we feel guilty the testimony of a bunch of hooey leaving him as history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie has found a strange crazy quality that I found more irritating than fun. We are not empathetic with anyone. And the big "Citizen Kane" polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow" we are not sure of Davies' motives for being at Hearst. Once we have told one thing, she plans to do the other. <br /> <br /> And we must believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain's life? Or he just tries one of America's most powerful - and apparently moronic - citizens. The movie never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is the production values. There is a wonderful relaxation of the hunt and the costumes. I watched more from the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than to follow a story that captures many of the best-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the script is fine fiction. The disclaimers that make the movie make it increasingly preliminary and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The artists can't be guilty, though Meg Tilly passes the parody here. Kirsten Dunst never teased. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​landscape chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much so that she wants to distance herself from the whole business rather than tell it. One of her first lines is, "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wished she wasn't. <br /> <br /> It's not the same as Bogdanovich's trashy, so bad-it-good "At Long Last Love." This is an attempt to tackle something serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is so bitter to the animal called Hollywood. This is National Enquirer movie entertainment. And it's not just the names of those who take the film aboard Oneida this weekend, but the audience is also very dirty.
