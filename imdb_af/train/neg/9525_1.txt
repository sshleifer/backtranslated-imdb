This totally dull, senseless, senseless, mindless and dumb movie is not the final proof that the world of Danny Boyle and his post-Trainspotting movies can be forgotten: "The Beach" has taken care of that. What this low budget peculiarity means is to secure its place among those who have started well, but have been completely lost in drugs, liquor, ego, self-esteem, bad management or whatever it has caused, leading to this fast-paced director's quick downfall. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, probably) meet by chance and start spontaneously with more desirable songs than more than a potential hit. duo - what they become. A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by breaking a shop window and stealing a video camera that lets them roll into action and then show the band some musicians who are really interested. show in this garbage. Now I know that in recent years, the United Kingdom has had incredible mess, but it is ridiculous; The music makes Oasis look like The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - changes lyrics in each recording and Ecclestone arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it, and it's absolutely absurd to do it. Not only is music totally and completely trash, but its "performers" are anti-social; these newcomers are supposed to call the shots. It's just too stupid. It's very awful. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is rude and nowhere, and this rag-to-bitch story has no meaning and makes no sense. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of garbage is so bad it is embarrassing to look. Ecclestone's I.Q. should also be questioned because they agreed to be part of this nonsense. Whoever financed the Â£ 1000 joke should leave the movie business before selling their own underwear on street corners.
