I wanted to keep this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be a hip hop theme spinal tap, but it fails miserably. It always feels written and performed by high school children for a school project, and this is also the level at which humor is aimed. There is no subtlety and, more damning for a writer, it never feels like a documentary. And while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt to deliver dead panels would have helped - anything would be better than the shells we undergo. <br /> <br /> I'm recommending it to people who hold "comedies" in the year of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think words like "buttocks" are inherently funny. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.
