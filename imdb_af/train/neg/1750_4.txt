Priyadarshan's HERA PHERI was a nice situational comedy. However, this movie is not a story, but rather funny but illogical. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not a proper story, but it does manage somehow well though it is not good. <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 funny scenes such as the one where Akshay and John Neha invite for lunch and another when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half becomes boring, but the second half The jokes are funny, although one wonders how they never hear each person's voices inside the rooms. <br /> <br /> The climax confusion is treated as a play, but it's pretty funny. But the movie suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> Direction is good. Music is good. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar excels in his part, which has now become his second skin, but it's his movie completely and he overshadows everyone else <br /> <br /> John stumbles through and fails in comedy. Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal is okay. The girls are hard and temporary and uncomfortable for Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is seen now) is good in parts but screaming too often Manoj Joshi is okay
