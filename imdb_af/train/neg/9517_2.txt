Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet me in St. Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I was waiting for this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Going is scene after the scene of nowhere fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing floozy hanging on him, coming in disappointing digs as a gall persuades him to complete his disappointing writing project. The film has a huge dramatic finish capturing a disappointing villain Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing. The sequence is meant to be stressful, but Minelli is not a Hitchcock; He is so distracted by beautiful colors, he doesn't see the scene being a tiny clich√© and the characters are so thin and poorly developed. We don't mind, especially they are being shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only true cinematography in the project. Otherwise we look at stubborn characters standing around bars and lounges at each other's nerves for two hours. Hell is other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> There is nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after World War II is better treated in "The Best Years of Our Life." And one of two Inge products, 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic', covers the despair of being trapped in a dead end town, with much more poignance.
