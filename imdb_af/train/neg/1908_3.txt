Another insult and bang in the face of gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again, we have an attractive "straight" hero who is unlikely to be interested in a woman. Yes, right! And we are also presented with the 'sympathetic, attractive' gay friend who is actually a thick, naked, ugly old man who is supposed to find the head attractive. Even I didn't find him attractive and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but grateful, not naked)! Whatever acting talent may be, is thrown away on a bad manuscript and really awful. Mr. Sneedeker must be banned from filming, but then he is no different from the many other hacks that work in Hollyweed.
