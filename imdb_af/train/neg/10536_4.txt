William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director / author credit for this entertaining low-budget movie about three boys who camp with their horror magazines in the bush. Feet is spoiled by fire and school son lit back and forth ... and a scorching town slip called Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface fame) wanders over and performs four stories of gore in exchange for food and warmth from the fire. . <br /> <br /> One story is the old version of The Hook, two teenagers on the lover's avenue attacked by a demented killer with a hand hook. Another story has a few wizards that must get some weeds. They stumble upon a man who knows a guy who has some good s # @ t. As they have a few bags full of smoke, their skin starts to turn gray and green before they call and fall. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to die and enjoy telling his cousin and cousin about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire story is of a greedy sailor who washes across an empty treasure chest and eventually thrown out by zombies to the sea. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point over and could have been a lot. A little weird but fun to watch, except maybe the sailor story. The acting is understandably not worthy of award. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
