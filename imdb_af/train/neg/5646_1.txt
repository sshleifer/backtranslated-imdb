Completely predictable doom about a man who killed his wife by cutting when driving and claiming to have become black. Why did he drive another car? Why did he still feel like driving a car to kill his wife? This question did not occur to the authors. The story then wakes up over a psychologist and her failed marriage, tied up in the failed marriage of the woman-murdered blackout driver. An all-knowing mother and one-dimensional child are thrown into good measure, and the whole builds on a predictable denouement and collapse. Are police psychologists so easily included? Deadly writing that the actors do their best, but they are doomed to failure. It's on a par with a Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time watching this one, unless it's what you're striving for.
