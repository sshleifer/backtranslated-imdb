I'm a sucker for a good romance, but this doesn't qualify as a good or a romance. I left the plot before the credits went through. With such poor dialogue, plot and character development, I suggest investing your hour and a half differently. I had to run out for the third time and rent Serendipity so I could get the bad taste of this one from my mouth.
