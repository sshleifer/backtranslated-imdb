I won't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say it can be a great show. This show is only good if you don't know what "talent" is. I won't even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to many people) because it's not really bothering me about the show. What bothers me is that people see it and think it's funny. It makes me feel that our generation is being stupid and I'm actually afraid that it will one day go through people who see this garbage. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is simple. It's about an offensive, self-centered, spoiled woman (Sarah Silvermen) coming through everyday life. <br /> <br /> That's it. Just as it hasn't been done a million times. Almost every joke is done or is racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing. I like her voice. it's not the lyrics. The lyrics are terrible .. she likes to sing about many things. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a hot woman, put everyone else and make it feel like crap, while at the same time talking and saying about each race, then this show is for you.
