It's made a very unpleasant, as well as movie. I tried it because it died Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mobster is about to be released from a spiritual institution, promised promising. The movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you have to forgive the pun - from dull and elegant people, to somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, knee dog, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy becomes while avoiding vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which are apparently humorous in a postmodern way. Goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie can fit on a 3x5 card, and he carries a single facial expression - a sardonic grin. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds does a cameo. The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (good moves from their side). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and inept; an heir, I suspect, the style of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers'. If you like, you will probably like this.
