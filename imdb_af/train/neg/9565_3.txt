I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, because it has one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen. Not once did a plot device introduce itself without guessing it 10 + minutes in advance. There was no subtlety about anything the movie did, no intelligence was completely behind the scenes. The intention of every spoken or typed line was so clear that it was impossible to enter the film. <br /> <br /> I laughed myself at the terrible thought plot line, and the bumbled efforts to regain the audience, much more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.
