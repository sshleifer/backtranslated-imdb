You ever get the itch to kill just an hour or two and watch a movie, so bad it denies the reason? Well, if you want to rent movies one weekend, I see the boxing art for this one and see the T-Rex. Knowing that the dinosaur was on the pack of Jurassic Park's T-Rex, I knew I should just rent it because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at all. Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortunes and shareholders than lives, and of course a large, poorly animated sock-top T-Rex. Is it me us through the movie were there scenes clearly speckled from other movies? Not to mention the Rex's hunger is never satisfied ... ever. How he is hungry is beyond me because he really does not have a throat. Now I like to watch incredibly bad B-movies from time to time because it reminds me of how much better a solid movie is. This one was hilarious. I'm not even sure if it's supposed to be a thrill or a comedy, because there are scenes where you don't make a mistake, you'll laugh. <br /> <br /> I stay the movie's budget ... yes, but the acting didn't help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles ... when you cry, don't you get "tears"? Meh, I'm not going to be angry with this movie, I knew what I got and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, that's what I recommend. Look at this movie and immediately look at Jurassic Park and then the world loses back to back. You will write Mr Spielberg, thank you the next day.
