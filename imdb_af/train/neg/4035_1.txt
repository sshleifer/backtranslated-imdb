I hate to be the one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this), but from the very first scene you can say this movie will be absolute. It's really a shame as I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was interested in how they would mix together in a movie, but to my dismay they didn't even have a scene together !! I think I have to repeat it - The two main players (standing next to the advertising posters and DVD cover) didn't have one scene together !!!! They did not speak to each other and never appeared on the screen at the same time. About this little excuse for a movie. False advertisement. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in the movie was unrealistic and inhuman. The scenarios were far-fetched, the plot was shit, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and poor men played Tim from the office), nobody was nice, and worst of all, some some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me off, as I couldn't see or listen. <br /> <br /> This low budget stinker was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer couldn't inject humor and charm into it, but blessed, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How anyone can judge this movie as "ten stars" is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I won't even give the big ten stars, as ten stars imply that a movie is perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which means it is almost completely across. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you want, but if you've seen a lot of movies, you've watched good movies, your review is likely to be similar to the mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
