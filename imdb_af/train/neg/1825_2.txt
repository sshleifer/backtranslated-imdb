I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh about it. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be a scratch @ ss about it. But I couldn't seriously laugh at this movie. It just wasn't funny to me. Some parts looked as if Ben Stiller and Jack Black were trying too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean it's an excellent comedy. Some movies just don't have to be made. This is one of them. Because it makes very old jokes and the acting was just silly. I know, I know it's a comedy. Kind of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can't give it less than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
