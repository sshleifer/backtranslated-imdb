No matter how good his message is - this movie is a terrible train wreck - horrible scene work, lame camera work - I don't know why Carr agreed to try to pull a stutter - he's mean. You look at the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follows him. He didn't suck it. He loves the center of attention. He's a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some of how Carr showed this movie at Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people seeking reinforcement and attention worry about how the movie touched them and maybe it did - but as a movie itself it is limp, predictable and juicy.
