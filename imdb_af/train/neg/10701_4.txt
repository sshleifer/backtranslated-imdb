London's cheerful skippers are a treasure hunt, with one young woman accidentally finding her married politician father with a strong, independent lady kite who has never been in love. Intriguing early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, who plays an Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix who herself was involved in handing herself over to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were, of course, dedicated to this project to get the female point of view, but why are all the old clich√©s intact like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the kind of simmering, cheerful woman who takes her bed when things go wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another bummer. A strange artifact, but not a classic for Kate watchers. ** of ****
