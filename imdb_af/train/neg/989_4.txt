Okay so I found out about this movie and I watched the preview read almost all the reviews and had a hard time debating whether to watch it or not. Before I even watched the movie, I was emotionally weird. I was so sure I was going to see it and be disturbed for a long time. So I choose to venture and look and that's what I thought: The beginning started well for me. It was right to be in a decent direction. I came past the rape scene and couldn't figure out why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Don't get me wrong, the rape zone was just as sad and scary, but it didn't really make me a dramatic point. When the drug came in, I understood the boring things going on. There were just 5 minutes of shots of nothing, but people walk around to say or show nothing! its one thing to get a shot where a person shows a kind of emotion, but this movie doesn't have it. It has about three of these senseless scenes, where you see the main character of Maya, out of control, but it has failed to move me forward. When she was involved with the hardcore party, it wasn't so boring, but still a little dull. Oh, and as a note, Rosario Dawson still did a good job. Okay, so soon after an hour of futility to the middle, revenge comes after Maya's attention. That's where it gets disturbing. I didn't feel bad for him or anything he got what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I just felt behind. I can't really say if you want to watch this movie, because it's so ... I don't know I can't get a word to summarize it. But if you choose to just see it, don't be unobstructed.
