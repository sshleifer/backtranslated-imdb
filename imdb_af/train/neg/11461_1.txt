Please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life. Don't look. Especially if someone is happy to slumber on your side. Damn cheek if you ask me. I was waiting for something to happen - it never did. I'm not one of those people to stop watching a movie. I must always see it to the end. What a big mistake. Do yourself a favor and go and paint a wall and look it dry - much more entertaining.
