I felt as I watched it ... but it seems to be the reason for the madness in the family in this movie. It doesn't make much sense, as others have said, it was one of Karloff's last films and it's just his screen presence that makes it any credible. It's sad that all the great legends of horror movies in the audio era have finally been reduced to start in low grade rubbish like this. Marinally, Boris found slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives him credit to try to keep this mess together. The strong background music does not help and leads to any bright moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is bought in a strange, cut, English monotone reminiscent of the kind used in porn movies in the late seventies. <br /> <br /> At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's House of Usher from which it was taken, but you'll hardly be pushed to find a great deal of Poe in the completed article. <br /> <br /> However, there are better better movies with Boris Karloff at its best, looking for them and giving it a wide cab, unless you also want the curse of the 'shrinking brain'!
