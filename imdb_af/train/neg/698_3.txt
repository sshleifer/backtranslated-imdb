An uninteresting addition to the stalk is a slash cycle that dominates the horror genre in the 1980s. It was filmed as Pranks but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is a clear steal of the 1970's horror anthology The House That Blood Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable face in the film and it was her first horror movie (she also appeared in The Initation and The Fly II).
