I love Jane Austen's stories. I only read two of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this adjustment, I reach for "Persuasion" from my bookshelf just to make sense of the story and also because I refuse Jane apparently Austen could have written such uncertainty. For me, I thought if you were basing a movie on a Jane Austen novel, you couldn't really go wrong. It will look pretty good. I went wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where are the characters you sympathize with and keep? You must have at least one nice character to help the audience invest their emotions into them, and it didn't deliver. Sure, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to come together, but just because that's what you know the purpose of the story is, they come together. Instead, I had to resist urgently throwing my teacup at the TV and keeping it to the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was completely annoying and at last I had no idea why Wentworth had been beaten by her because there was nothing for him to be attracted to. She was gentle, dull, dull, socially inadequate and came as a sheep following everybody's instructions, rather than having a thought of her own. It can still work for a main character if you do it well. It wasn't done well. <br /> <br /> The other characters only showed different degrees of narcissism, of which Maria was the worst, with a full-scale narcissistic personality disorder. True Ms. Bennet had similar mistakes in P & P, she was still engaging, while Mary was more of a freak show. More disgusting than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very nice and was like a decent man. For most of the story I just wondered what kind of person he was and why he fell in love with Anne, as if he were the kind of guy a person wants a little more ... alive? Active-way, not too much to say, because I reacted more to the characters who are portrayed rather than how well / badly the people act. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as I saw that he was there, I didn't expect any less. <br /> <br /> The story has also been very confusing. It wasn't until the end of the movie that Elizabeth didn't seem to be Anne's stepmother, but actually a sister (I'm not 100% yet). The whole Anne / Wentworth story was also a bit vague. They were together, but then they broke and they're both bitter about it? Why? I've been wondering for quite some time, and the explanation seemed to have shed her because she was convinced to do it by someone? But it is said in a kind of "by the way" that it was almost missed, as if it were somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant if it is at the heart of the story? There was also a lot of name falls, but no real sense for who the characters were. This Louisa person, for example, who was she? A friend? Family? What? It is not clear who the different characters are and their relationship with each other. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, who felt very unrealistic because Mrs. Croft was old enough to be his mother. <br /> <br /> The final kiss, yes, it was a bit strange to kiss in the street, but I didn't really think about it, because I was too busy shouting "WERE THERE!" at the TV, because Anne's lips trembled and shook and shivered for what felt like centuries before they actually met Wentworth's. There is some hesitation, but only for a few seconds or so, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there's the issue of camera work. As a regular movie guard, you don't pay attention to corners and such, unless you decide to look out. I didn't decide to do it here, but I still noticed them. For me, this means the filmmakers don't do a good job. Many conversations were with extreme facets, something that should only be used when there is a very important point to be made. In this adaptation it was overused and therefore had no meaning. The handcart sometimes did not really work in a drama. The camera also felt too contemporary in the course of the career. (Not to mention the race itself.) It was the only Austen adaptation I caught in the ITV's Austen season. Make me wonder if it's worth watching "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" or just reading the books and then releasing them. I'm sad to say, this is a Jane Austen adaptation I didn't enjoy. Maybe I'll see the 1995 version rather. The BBC is known for its beautiful Austen adjustments.
