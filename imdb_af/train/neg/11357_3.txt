1st the good news. The 3-D is done spectacularly well, and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks. Based on the true story of the culmination of human history, the film even features one of the real participants in the story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLIES, for crises! Fly with big, googical human eyes, where, but fly. Remember when I compared the Underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches? It wasn't meant to be praise, and I never dreamed anyone would accept it literally. This one has even less empathy for it. Babakoeke? Ugh. In one of those strange amalgamations of Hollywood group think, this movie was at the same time as the "Space Chimps", also over the roommates in space. <br /> <br /> Hire "Apollo 13" and see a 9-rated movie about the REAL Space Program (RIP).
