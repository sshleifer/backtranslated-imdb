This movie deserves a job on Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh riot. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All Monsters." Look out for the following: the cute medal (looks like the Shriners are here), the clear polyester Norfolk jacket on Allan Quatermain, David MaCallum's bad stutter (paying attention to his worse play). The incredibly bad process works on all the "monsters", the monsters themselves - the hand puppets that captivate the little girl, the giant snake Macallum disputes while sinking into oatmeal, the red light eyes on the motorized crabs, the incredibly hilarious boat (oh brother !!) apparently made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a remnant of a Jr.Sr. prom ("Voyage in the Future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they carry Roman imperial armor, but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come on!), and the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her scare) play smoochy-face-oh the horror! The best part is that the indifferent explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman, and the African-old Snuffleupagus or whatever - has clearly chosen to die heroically rather than be in any other scene.
