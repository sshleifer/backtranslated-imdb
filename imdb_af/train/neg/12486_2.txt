Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (a filthy mistress Bette Davis) is engaged to be married to stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and seriously kidnapped her by Steve Collins (James Cagney). They fall into the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) they fall in love. <br /> <br /> It seems a high rating of judges here, just because Cagney and Davis are there. They were both brilliant actors, but they were famous for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why! The writing is just awful - there is not one real laugh in the whole movie. The running joke in here knocked Cagney and Davis first in a cactus (that's done THREE times!). Only their great talents save them from utter humiliation. As it is, they both do their best with the bad stuff. Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screams every line with power, but it doesn't work. Carson watched this "hell" on his face throughout the movie (probably because his characters changed emotions in seconds). Only Palette with his distinctive voice and about the top readings, made it possible to lure a few smiles. But it was all dull and lackluster - a real task to go through. It only gets two stars for Cagney and Davis's play and beautiful cinematography, but really, it's not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis later hated this movie and you can see why.
