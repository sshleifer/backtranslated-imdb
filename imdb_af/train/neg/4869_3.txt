This film failed to investigate the humankind of animals that left me feeling empty. [Spoiler ahead] I wasn't convinced that dr. D really had a compelling reason to leave the big deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) created the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals against their peers, all the animals in this movie were nothing more than comic caricatures that one would like to eat in the meat. grinder (even more than one can understand their senseless baby). Without Eddie Murphy's face, this movie would be a flop.
