They had to call this movie ... Blonde women who colored their roots. Also the main character, geeze, the too tight jerseys. The giggling. Think the man did a good job. I hope we will get a good 8-star Christmas movie to watch this week. Throw the arrow. Must also laugh about it. We still have 3 more on the DVR to watch, maybe we will be happy. Oh yes, I quickly found out and nailed the man when he picked up the flowers and then drove with his cousin. I told my daughter they were going to the cemetery. And how stupid was the two gals following and spying on them? Creepy.
