I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology that is taught to the left. To say this, I think Left Back is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need a well written script. Behind Agter stood awfully short of this. For one thing, it deviates radically from the book. Sometimes it is done to divide a 400-page novel into a two-hour movie, but in this movie I saw changes that didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Another thing, there is zero character development. When characters are saved in the story (I will not tell who not), the book makes it clear that it is a long soul-searching process. In the film it is fast and artificial. The book was properly written where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham really look, but the movie scenarios consistently give the quick treatment without any substance. In another scene where one character gets angry to stay behind (again, I won't say who), it looks artificial. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I realize it is incapable of me to say that I do not like this movie, but I cannot recommend a movie that I have done terribly in good conscience no. Perhaps it would have been better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. Anyway, Christians need to realize that it has to be taken seriously as filmmakers. We first have to compile a movie in a good way. I realize a lot of trouble has probably gone in Left Behind, but that's the way I see it.
