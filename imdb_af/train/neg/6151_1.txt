... and by no means * as clean, logical and understandable as in the spicy sum of tired Hollywood cliches. <br /> <br /> I'm 27, and I've been battling life for 16 years with despair phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the movie, I was successful mainly due to logic: because I always thought of keeping despair away from reality and knowing what was really going on and what was not. Eventually I was very successful because of medication, but I definitely got rid of it because I knew before I took medication, the difference between what really was and what wasn't. <br /> <br /> So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story (which was not faithful to his wife, which was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a convenient, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is completely lacking. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not an "ordinary man with a disease", it is someone who sees things from early on and feels different from most people: things like time, space and people's personalities are not solid. things not. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and may even disappear. To deal with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world that does not expect "normal" people - but it is trapped in it because it cannot relate to most people and its world becomes poorer and poorer he is finished in an empty, deceptive deadlock. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is portrayed in this ridiculous "cure", ripping film. It must be scary. Other people, such as the main character, should be strange, strange and absurd, such as in Lynch's "Eraserhead". There should be really * impressive, strange, coarse hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is about. It's not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, see "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City", or play "American McGee's Alice" on the computer, and you may have a vague idea of ​​how it is . Don't watch the "good" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visual images, and stupid prunes. "The Cell" is the most accurate film about a schizophrenic thought, its visions and its inner consistency - it is violent, strange, confusing and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Again, schizophrenia is not about details, it's not a neat, easy trick that's played on you. It jumps into your face and won't let you go: walls fall apart, people become strange hostile creatures, you feel like you're going back in time, you're not sure you are who you think you are, everything feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much more than what is portrayed in this soap-like melodrama
