It could have been a wonderful story based on the old breeds of cats, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> This work could have been; wonderful and full of mythological references that fueled my fascination. The main characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause, and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were level, had no depth of personality and were barely likeable or drawing. Not even the character of MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) fits in with the description. <br /> <br /> But as I have said many times before, if you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV, you simply have to consider the fact that his books are not written for TV and his script Unfortunately, talent lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist. <br /> <br /> It's another attempt to write the magic of Stephen King, whether it's his novels or an original script. Simply cut and paste his work on the small screen. His novels are completely bastardized in the process and everything you finally create is a nice movie; nothing less, but definitely nothing more. His scripts are hit and miss. Unfortunately, this script translation was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 1.0 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
