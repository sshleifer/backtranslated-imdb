Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his fianc√©e, Kate (Eva Longoria) look at the latest arrangements for their reception. This is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a madness and overcrowding the caterers over her food offering demands. But horror of horrors, the "angel" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In a subsequent battle with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" girl falls on Kate and sends her to the afterlife. Now, one year later, Henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted to start and move other ladies. Still, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell), is interested in Henry himself, much to the crap of her caterer (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate is turning away from Ashley to destroy Ashley because she has no intention of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to give Kate back in heaven for the good? It's an awkward romantic comedy, one of the worst that this devoted fan ever saw. No, it's not the throw, as they try to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny like the remaining fiancee and Bell has a terrible style and humor that is also contagious. Biggs, a funny together, is also completely wasted. As for Rudd, a very talented artist (see Anchorman, Couples or Clueless, please), he tries the hardest of all and is indeed the main reason for seeing this clunker. Its charm, look and easy white goes a long way to making the film portable. But nothing can make a thought and frightening direction in a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a colored-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork on any money for this one. Even if free tickets fall into your lap, it is warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who love love-and-laugh.
