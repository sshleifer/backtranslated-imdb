Why, oh, why won't they learn? If you have a nice, juicy exploitation cookie, use it! Don't break around trying to get everyone deep and considerate; Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who has seen a little too much of Mama's kiss (Daddy-dressed-as) Santa Claus back when he was a child. So, of course, Harry gets excited about Christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment gets too big, he flips out, robs like Santa, and wanders out the city toys to good children, and kills someone he considers evil. <br /> <br /> Simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (How many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same sktick?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be more "Santa, Portrait of a Serial Killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is spent Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when I was willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles roll. You know a slasher movie is in trouble if you urge the killer to do just that. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry's descent into madness is in the hands of a capable director, but unfortunately, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently this is his only movie, and it shows. The action jumps from the scene to the scene, without putting shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we see. <br /> <br /> Even as the film rolls, we're still treated to help out of Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. More depressed than scary, Christmas Evil is one to avoid.
