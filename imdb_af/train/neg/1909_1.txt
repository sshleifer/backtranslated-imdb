One of the worst romantic comedies (no, worst movies) I've ever seen. Boy (who works as a mobile phone!) Must pretend he is gay to go to an apartment with the wife of his dreams. Hilarity does not occur. Boredom, light gay bashing and terrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crappy dialogue, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid it. If you see it, destroy the copy.
