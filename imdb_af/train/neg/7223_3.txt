My first attempt at watching ended in 8 minutes, about the TV report I couldn't handle. It went so much about: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our air. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. * Uncomfortable silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I watched it to the end, and it wasn't as horrible as I thought, but there is serious problems. with this. About half of the plot can be easily thrown away. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What is the use of the detective, the eugenic, and the monsters that are destroyed by Horus? More amusing was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods "who have lived for centuries, and of all the games in the multiverse our monopoly happens." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen? Why wasn't there a big event when he was released at the end? He had those troublesome followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What is the handling of the masked man? How did the blue-haired girl appear? What is with her sight? And so on. <br /> <br /> Visually it is good, more or less, if you ignore the Egyptian gods, such as walking villages with rock-cage heads.
