This movie starts out very slowly, but when the action finally begins, it's a bit to follow. I couldn't understand why some of the events happened, and many events happened before they were explained, making them confusing. The only thing that really matters is the massive amount of blood / gore it has, although most special effects are lacking. Blood looks like Red Cabbage Aid. Skin tears sound like someone walks on a stack of sticks. Again, the story has some kind of amateur on it, as the author didn't last long to improve it. I feel it could be a much better movie if the effects were better done and more time was put into writing. I honestly wish I hadn't watched it, not because of the gore, but because I felt I was wasting 90 minutes of my life. If you like many gory movies, it will stay away from you, if not.
