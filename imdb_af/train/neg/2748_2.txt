this movie just gets a second star because i work in the center and liked to have destroyed it. The effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. Being the most expensive and still absolutely terrible makes it a massive waste of money. I rented it so I wouldn't complain too much about what I paid, but it was a few hours that I never came back. plot holes are abundant. terrible action across the board. I do not recommend giving the time to see this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to see it, run away. I can't stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where did the second dragon come from? why didn't he appear earlier? how did they have rockets on the dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
