LOL! Not a bad way to start it. I thought it was original, but then I discovered it was a clone of the KING KONG 1976 remake. I have never seen KING KONG until I was 15. I saw this movie when I was 9. The movie's funky disco music gets stuck in your head! To name the film's theme song by the Yetians. These are the worst creatures I've ever seen. At the same time, this movie remains a sacred B movie. Retractable quotes: "Take a sedative and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE presented by Elvira. There is one scene where it is like KING KONG in reverse! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and climbs the building, but in this movie he climbs the building and grabs the girl (who falls)! Also around that year was another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) that came from Hong Kong. There are many travel carpet scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. It's like I said, just another KING KONG clone. Rated PG for violence, language, thematic elements, and some scary scenes.
