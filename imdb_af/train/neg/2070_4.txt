Too many bad memories I skipped this episode every time it appeared in the Season 2 series. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I always considered it to be the worst ST: TNG episode (with the exception of "Shades of Gray", which hardly counts as an episode). <br /> <br /> I continue to write a lot of dialogue and thinking of the writing written by the author's author 101 teacher: "SHOW, DO NOT COUNT!" From the verdict of Deanna Troi and everyone's constant elbow memories of what a charming, dangerous villain Okona is, Guinan's statement about how funny her drunken shoot is (that is not), after the opposing resolution for the conflict, It is not a plot point that is not highlighted and builds three underlines for us, and there is no credible moment in any of them. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a lovely actor in other circumstances, is also a puppy dog ​​that can be the center of the trembling of the plot. On the other hand, it may be that no one of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") can play a role in this underwritten placeholder. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, incidentally, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo had quit funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner didn't have anything here. Although the Jerry Lewis was a little funny in a stupid way. <br /> <br /> On a good day, you might think of it as a beautiful little tribute to a less original series episode. I'd rather go for "Time Squared" or "Q Who."
