I think I've seen worse movies, but it may be becuz. I'm so scared of how standard this bad horror movie is. The killer monster thing is really very bad, basically it's a guy in some green body suit. There is much worse going as far as B movie, but don't think for a moment, it was something star, hell no. It actually had a plot of substance, but was rather dumb. Actually, it's just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, that movie sucks balls, this one just sucks. The blood really looks fake in this movie. The one complaint I have about all the horrors of the new millinium, low grade gore, seems dumb. A good horror scene with really false blood is so stupid. There was at least a nice shower table
