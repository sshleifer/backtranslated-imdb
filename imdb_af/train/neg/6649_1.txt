OK, anyone who can honestly say that this movie was big or even good is either misleading or knows the Director, Author and Producers and is trying to improve the buzz on this movie. I watched the movie because a friend of mine was working on it and it was terrible. I am an actress and have been working in the industry for a while, now on big movies and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. The reason I am so hard is because this film was clearly a different version of "Of Mice and Men" and has to sue them because it is such a horrible cut of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classic book and movie "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new spin, I have so much. The actors, the accent, the dialogue and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dishonest. I mean if you're going to make a new turn on an existing story, make sure it's just as good or better than the original to justify the new twist. Didn't like this movie at all.
