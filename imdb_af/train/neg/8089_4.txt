I don't know what it's about Donald Sutherland's acting style or vocal style, but he always looks behind a massive cloud of Kleenex. He's just ... I don't know, thick? Somnambulistic? On meds? Weird. <br /> <br /> That said, I just saw the movie again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, I don't remember it ending anything like that. A bad end too, because nothing is tied up. What about the dead man? The annoying child (and was the child baptized?)? The Scotland Yard and military persecutors? I would like something that could pack it all up and make it all dramatic, not just the great panoramic infusion. <br /> <br /> And what woman sleeps with the man she knows, killed her husband? Even if she tries to convince Needle to protect her child, she can always have a headache. The last meeting made me feel that it was too itchy and uncomfortable ...
