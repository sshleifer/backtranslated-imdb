Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The play, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the relief, the plot line. Actually, I can't say anything positive about this, although I enjoy Swedish movies. The fighting tones are so ridiculous that it is impossible to take it seriously. And when the main character just happens to release his shirt while dipping dots into a strip, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks it's good in a good movie?! Regina Lund is the only half-off actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable statements and incredible reactions. It scares you that someone actually spent time and money on something like that ...
