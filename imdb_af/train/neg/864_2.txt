Although there is a repertoire of over 180 movies to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often called the best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even the legendary movie maker Fritz Lang, counts Succubus among his personal favorites. So, maybe it's me, but I thought it was a very boring and too confusing movie. However, the opening is good and shows that Janine Reynaud is performing an SM performance on stage. Unfortunately, it's all down the mountain. Reynaud's character is a maneater that eventually kills her lovers in a kind of trance. Franco has a decent budget to work with and spends it well on beautiful places, beautiful photography and a surprising musical score. It might have been his biggest movie, if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic, but I want to say sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half the time, you have no idea what is going on or what is being said, even the short time of 80 minutes looks like the ages. This is definitely not Franco's best movie to me. I wouldn't even recommend it for the hard-hitting exploits. If you're looking for more superior Jess Franco movie, try your hand at 'Las Vampiras',' The Awful Dr. Orloff or Female Vampire.
