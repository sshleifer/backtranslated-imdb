**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely no doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Completely impossible to take it seriously. It will take a great novel to list all the comedy routines in it. During the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and the company, which often began on films, this one was crafted in ways that were difficult to imagine. Carol played Jenny who suddenly got sick with a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around and wondered where it came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost looks like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing harder than this bit is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a dead end. Jenny really looks like she's dying, ... dies for her makeup artist to come in and give her some color. And of course we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to go to bed with the patient's last moments. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal on a snow bank considering his future in the movie business is an immediate classic. He has a lot to worry about. He never restored it.
