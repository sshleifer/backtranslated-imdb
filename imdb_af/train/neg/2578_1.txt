To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of elusive characters, or drinks or jokes. The music is just terrible, the humor is not funny and all the female characters are crazy idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the movie is actually written by a 14-year-old boy, who thinks drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and everyone who opposes it is geeks. Also, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies, except some names and Mr. Levenstein, who is a small character in this one. The only good thing about this movie is the pretty looking girls. Don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating, as it obviously overestimated and doesn't earn anything above 2.
