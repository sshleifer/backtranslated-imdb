A remake of the amazing 1972 movie of the stage play, pretty Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie. But do nothing else. <br /> <br /> An underperformance of actors, Law and Caine, further thins through poor self-reliance. <br /> <br /> The warmth of The essay in the original has been abandoned for a super modern home. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Caine, which made the first movie so visable, is replaced by a terrible arrogance that immediately worsens contempt in the viewer. But it's not the clever, in-and-out one, and the other character that has grown so well, it's an obvious OTT character killing of both characters. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing, watching the original movie and shining out the opening act.
