Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands it and offers the viewer the long face of Huppert's face. It's a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - she registers emotion with the slightest light of an eyebrow or flashes of a smile. <br /> <br /> Unlike the pleasure of watching an experienced actor, it performs in her profession. There is nothing in this movie that I want to recommend. (Well, if you enjoy self-reduction, sado-masochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" can work for you. Other than these features, I couldn't find valuable value in it.) <br /> <br /> Buried in All this strange material is a core of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musical, athletic, whatever - start out as strange people and are formed in strange people through the competitive environment. <br /> <br /> Not worth a movie. relive this lesson. <br /> <br />
