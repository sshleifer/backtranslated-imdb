If you watch this movie, you're either a Fred Olen Ray fan, you found it on the $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought "what should I lose?" Whether you turn around the video store with your eyes closed and hire the first movie that touched your finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It all has a terrible movie need: a jigsaw dialogue with jaw dialogue and plot baffling, wasteful science involving psychic and other dimensions, continuity that is shifted through time and space through workaholics, actors not just wood but seems to be bounded by stupid, generous nudity (not everything you would necessarily ask for), and of course, a 5 'monster played by what I accept is Fred Olen Ray's child. <br /> <br /> Below It's All, but something like Mickey and Judy has decided to put all the kids in the area together and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can handle it! yes! can use red paint from me Johnny's dad's hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper that can act in it!). <br /> <br /> Look for the blocker roll over the credits - you'll find out why the movie's final cut was so crappy. <br /> <br /> By the way, Biohazard II ... the Alien Force is also worth a look, but does not have the same nice-looking veneer this one does.
