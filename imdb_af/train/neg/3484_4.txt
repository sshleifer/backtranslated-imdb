I remember when it was in the theaters, the reviews said it was terrible. Well, I didn't think it was that bad. It was amusing and has a lot of humor in the face of families over vacation. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich man who needs a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He will visit the house where he grew up and make an agreement to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the attorney scene where they signed a contract. It was funny. <br /> <br /> So he makes foolish requests from the family and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a warm daughter for love. And he learns that the holiday isn't that bad. <br /> <br /> The whole doo-dah act was also funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black man and the girls' parents didn't say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah strikes his "supposed daughter." FINAL DISTRIBUTION: I thought it was worth checking out if you got it on cable.
