You know you are in trouble to watch a comedy, when the only amusing parts are from the Animal cast. It is a pity that the Cat & Dog parrot was only in support and not the other way around, as the people in it were completely improper. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what kind of name is it), Jason, and Lindsay, I will forget this acting lion and do something else because everyone is as funny as getting dry to watch, and terrible actors to start. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the movie is one of the characters screaming, I'm not Gay, it's funny as if you weren't. You might change your mind if you are daring, boring and daring with the three leading very simple women in the movie. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen for years, and hopefully I never see so bad again, though I don't expect it.
