I think if you are in the sci-fi and horror things, it can be interesting. The acting was good, but not good. The two pregnant girls should be fifteen, but are played by naturally older actors who were twenty-one at the time. The plot is okay, but the story is jumping around a bit and letting you guess whether you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to be using the two chain speeds. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a mysterious sect for examining events that only happen to those of that faith. What if the two girls were Protestant? Will the Catholic be cared for? That's why some are confronted. Who knows, the Catholic Church can even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, you don't feel you have lost anything.
