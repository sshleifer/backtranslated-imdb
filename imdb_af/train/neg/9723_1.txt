Jeux d'enfants or how the movie is translated incorrectly in English. Love me if You Dare is a movie made by stupid people and stupid people. I just don't know how to expect something from a movie with such a plot to be worth a look: Two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that everyone will do something (definitely extremely idiotic) to prove to each other ( wtf?) they are "cool dudes". I know I am exaggerating exaggerated aspects, but that is what the whole movie is about. They get older ... and instead of realizing they are just a few estranged weirdos, they stay crazy, think they are good people. <br /> <br /> One can expect such a Hollywood movie, but France? It is even more offensive to see the film from the country that Amelie created a few years ago, which, like the movie, looks like the movie, but is far, far away from. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
