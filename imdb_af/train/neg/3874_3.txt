This film was so predictable that you always hope the obvious suspect is innocent, and there is another big turn that still comes. But ... it doesn't. He just stays awkward, and she continues to ignore it. Maria found many accusing evidence at his place, and still she trusted him? And what was it that attracted the trap? There was no fall. She confronted him, he said, "Excuse me. I must kill someone." He left, and that was the end of it. They make efforts to use other suspects (such as the older carnival girl at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. Actually, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the environment is just strange ... hanging in a recycling plant? It is limp and nothing is well developed. For example: When she leaves his place after having the beer, and he finds the pictures and she walks out and he catches her and they end up sex in that car ... what was it? Her reactions were not portrayed. In the car she acted as if it could have been virtually rape - but then we see her shower the next morning. booooooooo It could have been so much better .. so much better.
