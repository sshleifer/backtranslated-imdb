I think it can summarize this view as well as anything. Batman TAS can be the worst thing to ever make comic books based on comic books, because everything that follows is compared to it and nothing has been measured yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond Good? "Yes, but it wasn't TAS." Is the Justice League good? "It's not bad, but it's not TAS." <br /> <br /> The Batman is definitely no TAS, but I won't mind it. It would be unfair and in addition it has many other problems. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is fine, and sometimes the art is very beautiful. But the rest of the time, the art is worthless American time, and it reveals many of the flaws of the show itself. It's tempo, written and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to see Jackie Chan Adventures, I was looking at Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I can clap my head anytime in a wall and get the same effect. The Joker is a murderous, mentally unstable jester in a suit that uses his wit, unpredictability and smart gadgets to fight Batman. When forced to hand, he will be either cheap or totally unmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who know kung-fu and can jump twenty feet into the air, with speed lines. If they wanted to do it with a villain, there were other less important characters they could use or * gas * they could have created a new one altogether. And it's not that reproductions are a bad thing, don't misunderstand me. TAS (there I go again) Freeze taken from your standard icegun wielding B villain and made him an unforgettable and morally complex character. Of course, Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain and they did an upgrade, but the point is. What the Batman does is take everything you like from Batman's comics and lore, and take a big, smelly drop on them. Guess what? They ate corn. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this show cannot stand against TAS, but it stands on its own and it still doesn't work for me. The plots are not good and they do not develop better. They were written for the demographic of children under twelve. Should children enjoy a show? Of course they should. It should not be a mature show with curse, nudity and free violence. But the point of a very good performance is that it can be enjoyed at different levels of all ages. This show misses the point. <br /> <br /> Is this show a TAS? No, of course not. The problem is that it's not even a JLU.
