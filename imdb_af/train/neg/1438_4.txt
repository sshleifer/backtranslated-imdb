Good! What can one say? First, this adjustment is too long at 4 o'clock, for the complexity (or lack of such) of the plot. The actors are really trying hard to make something out of this movie, but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character. Having seen Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", Swayzee really doesn't make the grade. This boyfriend with the Winchester recurring rifle does not have the power, stature, subtlety or humor needed for the part, and is included by everyone, including the witch doctor, who from my point of view is more convincing than an actor as the rest of the role. Some of the views are pleasant, but there are stupid mistakes in cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrives at the waterhole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible up to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in. Climb out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot), nothing like the exit seen from the passage to which they climbed, and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish he had. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who follow Quatermain is a crookedly created stereotypical character who only shoots at everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee is doing pretty well like the sad father, who has returned to London, who can't get the supervision of his son. Swayzee should keep that kind of thing. He can't carry the part of a brave man with a naughty heart, experience of life and the sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Minor
