Just bought for the VHS on this movie for two dollars, Wasted my money! Hey, I'm digging Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third prize production is a rehash of a dozen other biker movies; mad bikers, psychos drive in a hill town, beat everyone and everything, and then they are beaten in the man by a pounding hero. Adam West sees the part as a hero, but he misses hood and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's just not the same. Tina L. looks very nervous and scared of the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" when she was saved from the island ... LOL! The cyclists are a temperate group, and they knew they had ever acted or at least had to. Hell Riders are hell to watch!
