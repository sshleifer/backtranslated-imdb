I've done quite a few reviews on IMDb and this movie is unique because I've never seen the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and unpredictable that I couldn't find it - though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie, I call the Mel quotient. In other words, the better his film, the less of him you see in the movie. Think about it - Producers and Young Frankenstein were good movies and he was scarce in them. BUT, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are beaten full of Mel and are nice dull movies (yes, I don't like Space Balls - but it's not the place to talk about it). <br /> <br /> Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can't think of a less funny topic than homelessness. It's just a comedy breaker. Think about it, people. The FUNNIEST (?) Scene in the movie made Mel with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster !! And it's funny in what way?
