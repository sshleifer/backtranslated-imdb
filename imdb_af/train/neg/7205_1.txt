If you like to see what should start as a 2-hour movie in unlinked outbursts, you'll love this movie. Otherwise you just wonder how they could make such a movie of something so easy to translate into the big screen as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the previews of the movie, many scenes have been shown that are not in the movie, and within the film, some scenes do not make sense. While the movie is slightly less than an hour and a half, I can only think of one memorable moment, and it's just before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
