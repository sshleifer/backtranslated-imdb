I see that most people who think this movie is telling the truth are not born before the moon landings (1969-1972) or are old enough to appreciate them. I think it's much easier to question a historical event if you haven't lived through it. <br /> <br /> I was a youngster at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. The newspaper headlines shouted the latest action every day, from launch to landing, from moon walks to moon lifting, into a multitude of languages. In the school some classes were canceled so we could watch the most important events on television. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held its collective breath as men relieved the house of an uncertain destiny. You can't go anywhere without someone asking what was the latest. The world was truly one community. <br /> <br /> Now with a 30-year buffer after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because global enthusiasm and interest have died. We stay with our history books and anyone can claim that history is wrong and try to "prove" it with a lot of lies and faced facts while ignoring evidence altogether. live in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderful, happy and fantastic days.
