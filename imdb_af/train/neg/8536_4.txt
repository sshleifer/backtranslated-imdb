This is a typical production of Steele's novel, since two people who have suffered a kind of tragedy are given the chance to come together. I won't call it a spoiler, because everyone who has read a Steele novel knows how to finish ALL. Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a French decent woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't read it. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, Gilbert has to stop making movies where she needs to get an emphasis, otherwise she might not be able to deduce any accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet on the beach by her daughter, Pip, and initially accused Ophelia Matt of being a child molester just because he spoke to the child. . Everyone becomes friends after this episode and then the couple fall in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leads is not good, although the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a stereotypical writing. Two people meet, tragedy, greater tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they come together. I wish there was more to it, but there it is in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> I wanted senseless entertainment, and I got it with it. Regarding the genre of romantic films, it fails to be memorable. A secret relationship with Janine Turner is much better (not a Steele book), as some of Steele's previous books have become film.
