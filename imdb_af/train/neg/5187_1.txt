I'm not going to approach and criticize RAW theories. I mean, it's a movie site and whether the movie is or is well-made, and not a website's philosophy. <br /> <br /> It said this video was really blowing. It's a RAW talk head to the other. Some of them are archival video, so you can see how it has matured over the years, and it's pretty cool. But otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> This is a strange comparison, but I thought of the Sunday afternoon when I watched the Barbra Streisand star vehicle. * Funny Lady * Movie. After a while I was so grounded on the Barbra, and I thought there would be one scene she wouldn't see. You know a "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were something different ..." moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well, this video is RAW's * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So, if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at various tasks and angles of RAW's face while talking to his theories, assemble into a lame structure that doesn't matter. not or insight, then be my guest. For me, I can't take it after 20 minutes.
