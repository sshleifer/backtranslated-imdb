There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially right in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to fit in to see what all the fuss was about. new game show. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says and says, "wooww". <br /> <br /> The only thing nice about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over. To sit for a full hour was like going to the dentist. You find yourself clocking in what you think is 10 minute intervals, just to find out that only a minute has passed (but as was eternity) since you last watched the clock. So why didn't I just change the channel? Well, probably, for the same reason, most other people don't ... out of pure optimism. I mean, no one really wants to * think a show with Bill Shatner would actually be so bad. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought it was the kind of vehicle that would be. displaying the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. When I see it, I made myself feel depressed. You continued to get some excitement, but there was no one to have. There wasn't even enough light on the set to get a sense of energy from the audience (which you couldn't even see). Dear Network: People do not look at game shows to cure their insomnia. .. they look at game shows to be excited and have a good time. Please give us all a favor and lose it in the safe.
