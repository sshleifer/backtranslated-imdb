As a physics student, I became aware of many idiot professors and other so-called field experts. As I continue with my studies, I learn more and more about the actual physical experiments that are going on, and about the people who do things right. <br /> <br /> Tell my friends to see me about this "physics movie". I don't know anything about it, I'm excited and hope the information will be well presented. <br /> <br /> I've done REAL quantum mechanics; It wasn't. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything on a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies consist of somewhere around 10 ^ 30 such subatomic particles. It's a million billion billion billion pieces! The more "mysterious" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of completely canceling each other out. As you add more and more particles into the mixture, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. To believe that this is a valid assumption, without a rationality behind it ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts in the course of this movie. . But they were presented in the most misleading way I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't say much about the neural portion of the movie, because I didn't have any medical training. It looked like it had a little more truth about it, remember my days in biology, but I can't say. <br /> <br /> At least this movie had a redeeming quality: the dance peptides (or whatever they were actually). Not to spoil the valuable plot that this movie management does, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all the different types of personalities driven by their peptides, and then the movie cuts to the dance floor where we are split between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a full CG scene, filled with dancing peptides. The movie then tried to tell us how we were "addicted to emotions," so we are treated to the full song of that smash hit, "Addicted to Love." <br /> <br /> This scene was redemption, because anyone who could go through the scene and still take this movie seriously ... well, you are the one to open your eyes.
