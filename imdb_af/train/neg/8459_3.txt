Some very interesting camera work and a story with lots of potential. But it never comes back as a student's taught thesis in film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Fist, there isn't a similar character, not even a villain we might admire for his / her chutzpah. Secondly, all the acting is terrible - even by veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so abundant here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those miserable employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat an underdog hotdog and throw it up. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm a little rough on a young director who may still be places. As I said, the work of the camera is pretty good. br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - the blurb for this movie suggests we will see a "Modern Western", and the DVD packaging has pictures it also suggests - but no one actually has the movie linked. It looks like it's the kind of movie they're supposed to make. <br /> <br /> The betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact that we do not like these characters, we feel ashamed of the actors, the story is hopelessly disturbed, and eventually we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it halfway through the DVD player. but the rental shop will not give me back my money. <br /> <br /> Now it's really hurting.
