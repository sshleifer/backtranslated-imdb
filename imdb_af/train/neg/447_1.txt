Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There is often a lot of lamb, moral dedication, and simple. So this show! It threw a boring roll, though A. Bynes is in her beautiful way, the rest is just stereotypical shit .... as always. We've seen it before and will probably see it again when this show is canceled. Because we can see it, it is a mediocre and self-righteous show. Like most sitcoms, .... <br /> <br /> Well, briefly. If you want to see some good entertainment, you might rather break a twenty minutes ahead of the mirror. Do some faces and move on. It's more entertaining than this show!
