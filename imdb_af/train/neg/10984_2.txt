I watched this movie for his two hours and have absolutely no idea what it is about. Somebody killed or maybe they didn't and maybe someone did or maybe they didn't. It brought back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) When all the CBC Canadian movies were stinkers. Recently, stinkers have become the exception, but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism, sensible play of mind, and muttered dialogue makes up for lost time. I never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This movie continues with the fine Canadian tradition. It's not easy to look at. Perhaps the trendy people at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it. Our people in the beanies are a little less pretentious.
