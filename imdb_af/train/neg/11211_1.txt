There is so much wrong with this movie, but to sum it up: Terrible acting - so bad, it had to be the right way. poor writing - they might have had good ideas, but it was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad end - in some cases managing the end to save the movie - not in this case. If you sit down throughout the movie, you want to kick yourself in the end because the end is not even worth waiting for. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete torture set by this film, I would have appreciated someone warning me beforehand. So do yourself a favor. Just look at this movie if you can do absolutely nothing better. Even then, you will regret putting yourself through the unspeakable torture.
