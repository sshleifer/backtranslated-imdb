I tried to keep this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I couldn't go into this story because his two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) were just one thing in love with themselves. I admit that there was a smart dialogue in the shows, which was an important part of the success of the TV program, and I appreciated much of that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, it was almost like the old 30's and 40's helicopter comedy films featuring male to female. You get lots of arguments, accusations, screams and screams. Many people apparently believe a little, but I hate it, so I never got on the Moonlighting train. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as the unlucky aide, Agnes, was entertaining. It's too bad, she had so little airtime. Herder was nice on the eyes and I think women will say the same for Willis, but too much between the two finally deterred me.
