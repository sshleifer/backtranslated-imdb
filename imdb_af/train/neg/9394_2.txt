Oh, man, how low magazines fell by 1952! This dull thing is exactly the kind of series that Annie Wilkes (of Misery) irritated. Not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and it may not be there - tell me that when the bad people inflate the plain in episodes 7 to 8, they don't have the characters jump), but I think this series has the World Record or Stock Footage. I mean, most of it is stock material! And not just from another series (apparently all the flying rows of King of the Rocket Men, and the cool "cast rocks" screens of episodes 2 to 3 come from the Adventures of Captain Marvel), but of course! The entire "trip to the moon" series (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Ever wondered why MST3K never had episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9 times so they didn't have to do the thing again!). <br /> <br /> Don't get me started with the science factor. Prepare to see the sunniest moon ever! And moon men who can't breathe in their own world? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too talky and the stunts (usually the best thing in series) are few and far. Visually, am I the only one who thinks Commando Cody's spherical (or lemon-shaped) helmet is completely ridiculous? The Rocket's were much cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and the guy was terrible). The tank-like vehicle isn't much better, it looks like a lot of kids have made it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor who plays the hero is home-like instead of the ordinary muscle dog (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!) But then he is so unattractive. . /> <br /> Not even worth looking at nostalgia. See Captain Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (look at the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women-Lib-pearl).
