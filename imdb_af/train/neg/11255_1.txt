In a word, this movie was boring. It didn't have life and spark. A big problem is with the two leaders. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow didn't have chemistry at all. He was boring, and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The footage was interesting, but they didn't improve the scenes. As a matter of fact, the visuals tend to release the audience from what happened on the screen. Neither of the action ranges really felt, so the movie didn't make a real drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The movie has potential, but it needed better writing, better acting and a better director. I thought during the film, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford was the captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical awards for this movie. The critics I think praise the movie because they want it and want it to succeed, though it fails at so many different levels.
