What is the most disturbing movie ever made? The gynecological nightmare of 'Cries and Whispers'? The acidic psychodramas of Fassbinder? The unlucky black comedy of 'Last House on the left? I'm sure that the part of the film-loving audience that connects their masters to the good ship Buster Keaton is just one answer - one of his audio films. <br /> <br /> I don't know what my soul is fluttering in this movie - the foundation of Keaton's intricate and vast physical art to relieve slapstick; the painful hesitation of this master filmmaker with dialogue - not that he does not have a beautiful, comical voice, or that he cannot make dialogue; It's just that the studio didn't give him enough, and so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers. It just makes him - Keaton, not his character, looks stupid; or is it the humiliation of the fact that Keaton is trapped in a tawdry sex prisoner when he gave us some of the richest accounts of romantic frustration in film? <br /> <br /> No, I know the biggest stumbling block - watching Buster Keaton, the biggest comedian of the movie, set aside to see Jimmy Durante doing his sktick. These are horrors like what your Dante's infernos compose. <br /> <br /> MGM had the funniest idea that the best way to customize Keaton was to make it into a Marx brother, complete with verbal pedantry, extensive, boring 'clowning', shambolic slapstick, theater environment, triumph by chaos, and Thelma Todd. Keaton was just not such a comic, and Groucho's malicious tongue and joyful opportunism might just make this plot work, Buster's socially unknown professor, he can be studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to be allowed experiments like Lang in 'M' or Rene Clair; He would never have tried to keep the tide like Chaplin back. When a movie such as 'The General' is called - to beat trains - the loss becomes even clearer. <br /> <br /> And the thing is, in patches amidst the flat direction, the movie isn't that bad - there's an excellent push when a camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at a train station ; and the unbundling, if barely original, is at least more lively than before. There is something almost impressive about the way Keaton slows down a plot that needs all the zip. <br /> <br /> There is a film about loneliness, emotionally crippling order, the numbing effects of education, etc., struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this film is not to see the story of Professor TZ Post, but of Emasculated genius Buster Keaton, trapped in a mediocrity prison, confused by new technology, mocked by a malicious fate (in this is the studio). retain a stoic grace. Looking at it, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
