Totally pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring and boring, and most of the role-players would not even have made Allen's earlier films. And to listen to the indifferent Will Ferrell, his Woody Allen imitation makes me even more second-rate (though secretively popular) Ferrell. It looks as if 70-year-old Allen, who was more than 70 years old, had to beat the work when the watch ran into a new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to get involved in the movie, but it was just impossible; my cuts could not burn it slowly. So, instead of sleeping in an upright position in the afternoon, I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where I had a very good book to read again (George Bailey's great threes of 30 years ago, "Germans." The day has become pretty good, no thanks Woody.
