This early Adam Sandler movie can be compared as a comic book in the same period in 1989. His character's constant recognition of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come from Sandler more than writing. The movie is nothing compared to its flashy feature films, like Big Daddy or even Corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler has not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny way when this film is made, much like his character. The majority of the movie's "jokes" come from Sandler who had conversations with himself, usually about his unrecognizable comic talent and defeated him because he was too ugly and unable to get women. The movie is also hard to watch, because it doesn't handle itself like a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or dubious content. The movie is finally uncomfortable and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I even saw this movie after it was over, fearing it would ruin Sandler's career. Passing this one at the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
