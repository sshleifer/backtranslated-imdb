WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you need to care, too, sorry for the caps.) <br /> <br /> Start with an unnecessary dramatic voice that is increasingly annoying for talking nonsense, it continues with nonsense and unnecessary drama. It is bad but accurate. <br /> <br /> We know that space tourism is a risky business. There is a complicated system with lots of potential for malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc., and unexpected things will happen in largely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things went wrong. It is called learning. Permitted, Appollo 11 was not safe according to today's standards and there was tremendous political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Several bugs / comments I didn't even look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech if something went wrong. Well duh. That's what I did. It was the culmination of a propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives a green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 is likely to inflate. (However, this is only "implicit".) Yes, that's why they are pushing people into almost real-time. <br /> <br /> 3) The capsule ejection will not work. As it didn't work the time, there was a chimpanzee. The one who survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There is a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or look it up somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) An interviewer says an explosion would have wiped out a fair share of Florida. I can only assume it is meant as a hyperbola, because if I am not, I was just terrified of how he could get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology was then primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware are being used today, the reason being that it should not crash. It's even worse for spacecraft, because their computers have to be built of comparable large components that are not so exposed to radiation. (And the vessel itself must be manually controllable anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2s won't do.) What is the fact that they use "TV screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. Actually, TV monitors were significantly higher in definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If that object wasn't part of the rocket, it could be just one thing." We see where it goes. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it was not a rocket share? At least an interviewer states that if a thing is flying and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unknown flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) Making the voice over and some wrong quotes It looks like the lander's radiation film was actually his skirt. What would make it thinner than a space trip. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's near death during a practice flight is imagery I can appreciate; I didn't see it before. As I said, a piece of clear technology can go wrong, especially if it is not adequately tested, because you know, unmatched. 9) The deviation from the trajectory of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the moon's density) was not at all acute life-threatening. The "fifteen-second fuel also did not leave", which was actually "fifteen seconds of fuel left before the mission had to be stopped and returned to the command module". <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic chain of events" usually leads to disaster. I really don't know how to make it easier. However, this is an excellent example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short drive from one of the astronauts walking around and hopelessly walking like a happy child, followed by the voice over telling us. that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed". He seems to be walking and aimlessly walking like a happy child. Hilarious stuff. <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that all contacts were lost during re-enrollment. This is a natural phenomenon and it was so well-known when it was impossible to bypass modern technology. Again, the seriousness of this is implicit, but very deliberately so. <br /> <br /> 13) There was never lost a shuttle in space itself, while the vote on this fact proved that Appollo 11 was a heap of shit. Appollo 13 was a close loss, but the two real disasters occurred respectively during the lifting and re-entry. Anyway, comparing shuttles to Saturn rocket is somehow ... well, okay, not stupid. Even ignoring this, the successful shuttle service does not seem to interest the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) What is half the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it doesn't make sense. Unless you assume it's made for entertainment purposes, targeting a specific audience (including people without understanding history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the tip of the movie is somewhat dark. Catches such as "covered up to now", "appear here for the first time" come up, but the film does not blame or offer a lesson or something that can be expected from such an emotional film. . In the good old tradition of sensation, there are numerous interviews and recordings that are often out of context or with people who know us nothing but "NASA scientist". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the attempt? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yes, what point. <br /> <br /> In summary, in addition to being intentional or incompetent, it's not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a man who enjoys his crappy documentary; This movie is not funny, greasy, beautiful, it's nothing.
