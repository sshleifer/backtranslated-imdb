Don't expect much from this movie. In many ways, this movie looks like a movie in which Doris Day came in July 1956, titled Julie. In this movie, Doris, who was a flight attendant, landed the pilot in the then aircraft after her dead man, shot by the captain Louis Jordan. She did a much better job, more convincingly than Kim Ojah, who had control of a 747 control and managed to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 planes, I use myself to be myself. As I said, don't expect much from this movie, it's done on a cheap budget. The producers were inexpensive to use an airplane with the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name that used several movies. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.
