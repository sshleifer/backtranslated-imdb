This movie offers nothing but the stupid conversations possible. In fact, I probably didn't think how meaningless a movie is, how synthetic the dialogue could be until an hour ago, but then I saw this video again. In a movie that doesn't rely on a powerful script, one expects at least good acting and enjoyable conversations and even some humor, but this movie misses them all. you have heard me it has them all. there is not a single point I like about this movie, nothing. I hate it. I'm sure somebody will do it too. The name is intended to give the target audience memories of nudity and things, but it even succeeds in nudity. I don't know how, but I thought to watch this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend you not. worst movie I've seen in my life. if someone offers you to see it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave you liiiiiiiiife
