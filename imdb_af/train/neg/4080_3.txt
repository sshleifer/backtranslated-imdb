It looks like one of those movies we think we should keep, but I don't. It was really too difficult to be "artificial". All flash, without content. It has some beautiful scenes, and any one is nice to watch, but packs them all together and it becomes a difficult task to just sit there. I rented it because of the glowing reviews on the video card, and the fact that I'm a big Shakespeare fan, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a little pretentious, and sometimes, boring.
