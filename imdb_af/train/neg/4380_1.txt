Plot: An Amorous couple decides to get into a flashy car, involving illegitimate hijinks. They are then (literally) stuck in a compromise position while the car is walking in the countryside, until the unfortunate couple is rescued by the authorities. <br /> <br /> That's it. It's the whole movie. There may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing happens. It should be clear at the moment that this movie is not only meaningless, but actually painful to watch. The fact that it is two of the best up-and-come actors in the United Kingdom (one of which is now unfortunately passed away) has only the horrible feeling. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson was excellent in the very deserving Oscar wagons of fire. Let's remember him for that role, and try hard to pretend that this particular cellulosic horror never happened.
