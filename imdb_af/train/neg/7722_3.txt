Extremely poor action movie with everyday Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seemed. The action is at its best, a little nudity overtook and yes, Tia Carrera uses a body double! <br /> <br /> The setup is the usual apostate policeman who was forced to break a new mate into a big deal. The makers are trying to give the formula a twist, which makes Lundgren police with Oriental values ​​and Lee the modern city clip, but there is zero character development that makes it almost comical, Lundgren's Oriental warfare equipment for the big action should be seen as believed. The action series are by the numbers and Lee (who would continue to make the excellent The Crow) never get the scale to show a particular martial arts brilliance. But his illustrious parenting he had had a lot of pressure and was much better served not to live with his father, by playing a very different role in The Crow that showed what a unique actor he might have become if not for its tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> If you don't avoid a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of arm 80's style action movies (think Cobra etc.). <br /> <br /> Poor 10/03
