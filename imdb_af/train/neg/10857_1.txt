Watch the movie website, more time was created than writing the script for this movie. It can't boast anymore in it. Original story? Original? They must have found the writing hidden between the Old Testament or a legal consequence for that little horn-topping. High-end special effects? Come on, I can do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of overwash. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, America's funniest home video look is still a classic. I'm sure they have little money available for this title, so of course the sphere isn't that good either, or a little bad now and then, or just hilarious, but that's the story that makes this movie a waste of time. and money. 4 stories roll in one and all of them brainless bits-befores and ready-to-go.
