Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! It consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that sit in my seat in me, seriously, my cat could have worked better than this lot. Some of it was actually laughable because it was so incredible, I would have been lower, but they have nothing else! So keep my warning and unless you make your suicide so much and want a good reason to continue with your suicide mission, don't wrestle with this one. I am still shocked that it can actually be made available to the public, it must be a crime and all concerned must be arrested. I gather that you have the core now, so I'll give it to you to decide.
