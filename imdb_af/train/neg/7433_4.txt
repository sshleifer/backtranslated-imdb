I have to be quite honest to first say that I've fallen asleep somewhere in the middle so I can't give a full view of the movie before I see it in full. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), are planning a fortune stealing a variety of contraceptive pills from Finisham maternity hospital. This is where the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works, along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). There are also patients and their visitors, including pregnant mothers. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nerve dad, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and East Enders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. This plan is not right then, because all the staff are getting in the way. It can pretty much say everything about the movie until I fully see it again. Okay!
