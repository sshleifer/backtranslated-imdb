I caught it on Showtime tonight and was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting prospect would be to be so terribly dreadful. WHO'S YOUR PAPER? stars Brandon Davis as a pleasant high school senior Chris Hughes, a geek who survived the heir of a porn empire by his biological parents. Although the premise sounds like the movie can be fun, it is devastated by director Andy Fickman, a clich√© and predictable script, which is not right. It's even bad by direct-to-video standards. Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert turns in a surprisingly dishonest performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud. 10/01
