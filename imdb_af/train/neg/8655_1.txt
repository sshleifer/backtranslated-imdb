What a terrible movie. It sucked. It was awful. I don't know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, who I stole from a reviewer with a nail around his ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. It's not Roger Corman I hate, it's this god-horrible movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. Another thing that sucks the CGI out loud; I hate this movie terribly. This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably also the gayest B-Movie. This is-it is --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I had nerds in these moments. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
