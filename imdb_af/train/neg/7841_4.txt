I thoroughly enjoyed a man named Horse when it was released in 1970, but played back as a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, writing, plot, decisive and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Vrou, a parent of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, nor half of the other Indians played by Italians, Mexican and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the head acted more like a thick old squaw as a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who has done such a beautiful work in the original, seems to be throwing around this time. I suspect he could not withstand the easy payroll to reprint his role as a horse. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some interesting moments in the movie, as Horse's painful purification ritual undergoes "finding his vision" and collecting the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but In general, Return is uneven, boring, wheat and predictable - just like most persecutors.
