My girlfriend once brought The Zombie Chronicles to us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her to pay Â£ 1 for it. While watching this movie, I started doing things I'd rather do than look at The Zombie Chronicles. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drink bleach 2) Rub sand in my eyes 3) Write a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Review of US Civil War 5) Tax Returns 6) GCSE Mathematics 7 ) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote it? The guy couldn't even dig a hole well. The best thing he did was down (the best part of the movie). It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw White Noise: The Light. Never a movie had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame to own this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> News only in: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Fact. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH
