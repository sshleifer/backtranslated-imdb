Raw zone is a terrible movie! It's so simple. They seem to have tried to make a movie to show real life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately, Denmark has good young actors. Leon is still the little girl in "Krummernes Jul", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the movie she plays without soul and it destroys the movie! <br /> <br /> Although I consider it a movie you should see. I don't agree that the youth behaved like that, but I think it can show how it can end if you drop your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as "Film-folket"! <br /> <br /> All in all, I think people should see Rawzone. Not because it is a good movie, but because it is a movie that deals with important themes. I also think it's important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it's in these scenes, Laura is performing best. - like the end where she holds the gun!
