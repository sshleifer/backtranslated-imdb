Millie is a juice. She married a rich man named Maitland and they had a child. She then took him on her and cheated him ... but let him keep the child she claimed to love. Earlier in the early 1930s, she would be entitled to solid halls and child support, but let the man incredibly easily ... without any support ... what a juice! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life looks pretty good, it also seems that he is a dishonest! Wow, she has a hard time choosing men. <br /> <br /> Because of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she is a game party girl - doing everything she can to divert her from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter, who left her early in the movie, is now 17 and strange fashions have not changed one piece. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) Imagine she's the girl's friend, but he has nice designs on her. Millie promised him that if he touched the girl, she would kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a confusing and often bizarre mess - a bit like 'Madam X', but much, much less focused. So often Millie's motivation and actions seem to be little sense. And the movie looks like it's a bit of everything being thrown into it - as long as it supports the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual but not very good.
