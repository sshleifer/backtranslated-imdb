Paint by number story and mediocre play saved by a true color - and a few moments that really felt wonderful and deep. This effectively delivers the delicate transition from adulthood to adulthood and is very sensitive and resourceful to the mainstream cultural conflict. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this germ of a good movie is taken in a goalless and extremely captivating way. complicated plot to gather religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man living in the forest, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals , the complexities of local church politics, and over and over and over. And this doesn't even include the real central plot, it's just about the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized that the whole thing had to happen in the course of one summer (and so much movie got in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Eventually the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, big life-changing events happen and then forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of the events are extremely unpleasant. Most shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a terrible crime (in a totally predictable "turn") and then completely forgiven and the whole incident has been forgotten from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is exposed to die a few minutes later and give another "twist". It's all completely mechanical, up to the end that neatly connects to all the loose points (not all of them, just those whose movie thinks you care.)
