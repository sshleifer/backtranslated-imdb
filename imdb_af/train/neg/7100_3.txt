This movie is a promising start and is then very confused and confused. Kamal Hasan made a lot of effort to get the time right, sorry he didn't spend more time on the plot. Most of the small characters in the movie appear for no specific reason. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing, I recommend avoiding this movie.
