This movie makes "American Pie" a sophisticated movie! No further comments needed. Humor is cheap, dialogues are stupid and the role is uncomfortable. Each clich√© is used several times without any original twist. And by far the worst, the movie seems to be more Catholic than the Pope. It's so sad.
