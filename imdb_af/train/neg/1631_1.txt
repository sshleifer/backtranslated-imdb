Please encourage me as you please, for a moment while reading the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box. It says that: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city, every street is a dead end - at every corner, something to buy - every other way to die. To survive you should be the best. - Like the Alley Cat. Alley Cat - This lady owns the night. On the streets where even the predators become victims, she knows how to survive. Cross her and you went out of luck. Alley Cat - This animal is awakened. <br /> <br /> Now isn't one of the most pathetic blurbs you've ever heard in your life? Whoever wrote it should be insane if they thought such an awful description might prompt us to watch the video. Nevertheless, the faceless person responsible for the tragic use of English was unfortunately just too good for their work. The movie in the plastic bag is as bad as it sounds, and then some. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the title role and the script basically tells her about every given scene either a) Pout like a goldfish b) Kick male or c) Show her female 'traits'. No complaints about the latter, but in terms of the other two. Let's just say she's not much of an actress, and is even less convincing than a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with Cynthia Rothrock's body (which is a scary thought) will fail to save this movie. The deployment of the plot is boring, because we have an infinitely directed battlefield after it is enough, just for hysterical court situations and the occasional gag-inducing love scene with the interesting name Robert Torti. The camera work also follows a similar path of shame, with too many unnecessary close-ups and continuity errors being abundant. <br /> <br /> The part I think really picks up this foam basket from a movie is where our heroine is sexually assaulted, and finds herself in front of a corrupt judge while her rich-child raped her from the box off learning. Not only is he firing, despite the overwhelming testimony against him, but she herself was sent to jail to dare to protest the verdict before his honor. Behind the bars she has a group dance, a lesbian lover, a few fights and a nice game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her struggle. This ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the screenplay sneaks down to surround it. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add a little more T&A to the mix and gained this unnecessary subplot as a way to achieve that goal. <br /> <br /> What kind of question is it, is an exploitation movie, or a serious drama? And that is not my answer either. It's not fun or camp enough to appeal to Troma-style theater fans, and it certainly doesn't make the grade as an exploration of one woman's struggle against the system. Pure because it's so horrible. So who on earth wants to see it? Lunatics, I think .. or IMDb judges staying up to 15:00 and looking at the old garbage on the box while trying to sleep. Unfortunately, I failed this opportunity, and the horrors will stay with me long ago. Don't make the same mistake I did. Eat a hot milk or something. 1/10
