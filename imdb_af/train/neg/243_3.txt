William Russ is the main character here for TV films. He left his family just to appear again and started paying off his debt. But he is trying to stay away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in and plays various roles to convince him to come home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it to a pretty good degree. But William Russ wasn't really a star. However, it seems his play is still OK. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could dictate the word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. <br /> Overall, this was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it will receive a "D".
