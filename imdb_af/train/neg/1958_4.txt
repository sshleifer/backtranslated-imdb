Where to start. This movie started out as something that looked like a rip-off of "Darkness Falls". An old, unsuitable woman living in the bush gives children gifts for their teeth. Sounds familiar? Then change it. In "Darkness Falls" the dental festival just killed you if you saw her. The tooth festival in this movie killed you, no matter what. Why do they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would have been good without them. The producers seem to have been driving around and have decided to put extra people into the movie just to kill the people. Although, it is nice to see a beautiful blonde girl who is not portrayed as a bubblehead for a change. Good to rent, but I wouldn't suggest buying it.
