If you've ever been plagued by a Christian on the Underground who says, "Jesus is the answer. What is the question?" Then you should thank God if you have never met a Lacanian. Slavoj Zizek, the most evangelical of Lacanians, will surely exchange the word "Jesus" in the statement for "Lacan / Hegel". <br /> <br /> Zizek's star is currently burning, undoubtedly because we generally watch movies and purify pop culture as entertainment for our consumption. So it looks impressive when someone - someone comes together and says, "Hang on, movies can say something about ourselves." <br /> <br /> The ideas Zizek portrays in this movie are "true" because he says so. For example, Zizek explains that three Marx Bros are the ego, superego and id. (God knows what happened to Zeppo or Gummo? Maybe they're the sin ... or is it movie itself?). It's simply what they are. In Zizek's output, culture is not there to be investigated, but merely as an example of its ideology. People can object that he certainly has something to say - but how else is that which he says of the Christian, ascribes everything to God's will? <br /> <br /> What is wrong about taking examples, from movies or anywhere, to illustrate the theory? Well, nothing at all. As Zizek believes, they can even serve as proof. However, it is only cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context. Without context, you can say and prove anything you want. For Zizek, Lacan is the answer ?? so he goes and makes an example. Everything but everything looks like the teachings of the Master and the culture, is to carry it out to serve this ideology. For example, Zizek's example of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in Vertigo when Jimmy Stewart spies on Kim Novak in a flower shop. But in the context of the movie, it's not a voyeur's fantasy position at all. Stewart was deliberately led by Novak there. This depiction of examples isolated from their context continues through Zizek's two-hour and half-film preaching. <br /> <br /> His analysis of the "baby wants scene" in Blue Velvet is laughing. Zizek says lightly what he seems to be the terrible (for the masculine) truth of "female imagination", saying that Isabella Rossilini's character not only demands her breakdown but is unconsciously in control of the situation. This is an example of her "jouissance". Well ... possible. But - sorry to be prosaic - where is the evidence for this? In the film, she partially undergoes her humiliation because Hopper kidnapped her son. Zizek may object that she also clearly enjoys having sex with Kyle MacLachalan. But it can be because of any number of things. Isn't that the point of the so-called female "jealousy"? According to Lacan, female imagination, in contrast to phallic imagination, cannot be articulated, it is beyond the false catch and castration of language. If that's right, no example can be made. It also means that the whole concept is non-sensual and completely mystical. It can only be pointed out by dogmatists like Zizek: "There is a female surprise for you! Why is this female imagination because I say so." <br /> <br /> What examples can really be obtained from these movies? Only Zizek's psychology. Why does he keep himself in his favorite movies, even to the point that he wants to say in a boat on Botega Bay he also wants Rod Steiger? Isn't it the wish fulfillment of someone who spends his life on critical films? As said, Freud will have a field day with The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema - but with Zizek himself, no one else. <br /> <br /> Zizek's theory that movies show us how we want is perhaps right. Of these, however, these films cannot be strictly universal examples of psychoanalytic laws. This film illustrates how Zizek desires and only extremely vague - as it is almost useless - how the rest of us desire. Because as any psychoanalyst knows, how we desire and what we desire cannot be completely separated - and cannot easily be made universal. Zizek's love to make everything an example of Lacan's Answer, explains: How do we desire? So, so do I. Problem is, in Zizek's desire, everything and everyone else is rationalized in his desire. But Zizek is a Leninist and they certainly don't like to let the topic speak. <br /> <br /> The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is a summary of Zizek's love for dogma and is completely unphilosophical, even though it remains very political (what is dogma?). Zizek has never questioned what his motives might be if he starts an analysis, which he is trying to discover, because the terms of his exploration, and therefore his ethics to do so, are never discussed. <br /> <br /> Zizek is extremely productive, but all his books and this film say the same thing. He is a kind of Henry Ford of cultural theory: mass production and any color as long as it is black. He is perfect for today's highly consumer society: so-called critical, while people give the same c-ap over and pretend it's something else. It is popular because people prefer predominantly prepared answers to their problems - which capitalism always claims to give - rather than investigating things with any serious consideration. It's kind of like being brain dead. For me, Zizek's third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule. <br /> <br /> PS: I loved Zizek's solemn remark - presented as a revelation about the film and humanity - that music in movies can affect people's sympathy. Did it just happen to Zizek after watching Jaws?
