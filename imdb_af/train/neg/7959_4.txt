Andy Lau star in another police undercover story. Daniel Wu plays Nick who works for the police and is also close to a drug-dealing gang (Lau). The movie starts when we watch the police trying to make a drug jab just to see it. We are then introduced to the young drug addict mother and her daughter who live near Nick and his cronies and police. And 45 minutes I turned off the movie and posted the news. Well behaved and good at looking at it, is to evade a movie, as I have seen long ago. It's not bad as such, it just doesn't mind you. I mean, I didn't cry at all. I actually forgot something else that I had on a caption movie, that's how much I didn't care. I wish I could have hated the movie, but the movie is such a nerve-rack that it made almost no impression on me (it's not even something I could sleep, but just something to ignore). Come on the box call it the Chinese Scarface, what was he dead? This is one to avoid.
