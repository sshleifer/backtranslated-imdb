Consider ending the grudge 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly speaks Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar herself - and a creepy mirror < br /> <br /> OH AND UNDERWATER ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> not a good movie. I didn't enjoy it at all. The poster for the movie is also very misleading and I found it was just sucking people to watch it ... I can't believe I've gone. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... go see Saw III ... a movie where the script makes you feel bothered. <br /> <br /> Im Mike and I are out
