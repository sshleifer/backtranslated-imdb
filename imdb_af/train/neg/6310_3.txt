I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Many of the "time facts" were down. At the start of the film, the grandfather commented on this grandson and friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. This film had to take place in 1994. One of the grandchildren's friends also wore an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He wasn't even set up yet. The story line was good, but the facts and timeliness of the time frame were so far from the base that it made the movie look like. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and memorabilia of World War II. I hired this movie and hope it will be good. The acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was performed, pleased me that I only paid $ 4 to rent it, as opposed to the 50 that would have taken me to see it in a theater. I hope everyone who reads it understands that I have no dissatisfaction with those who fought the war, but the facts and timeframe had to be monitored a little more.
