This movie is an excellent example of wasting large resources in a movie. You will have future SNL and SCTV stars in their forefront, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty who essentially make 70 minutes of rough, uninspiring and racist jokes. The concept of a network of the future undergoing society could really be taken to some interesting extremes, but straighten the gate, make a crippled, youthful proctology joke and stay in humor all the way. much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is just for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70's sketch comedy films.
