It was probably just my DVD --- but I wouldn't recommend anyone try to watch this photo on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to get the volume on my TV at the highest possible level, in To hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some of the talk remains sub-audible. If you come from Scotland, you may have a chance, even if it's a slender one. <br /> <br /> Almost all environmental sounds, including packing, footprints, even on a cigarette, make folk voices drown. <br /> <br /> With volume reaching a level where voices can be heard, I can ensure that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene turns into a harsh environment, such as a disco. And that you will hurt yourself to dive for the remote to turn it back. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this attempt, in a time of war, will meet international criteria classified as an abomination. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour I gave up and saw nothing else in the picture.
