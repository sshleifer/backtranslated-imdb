Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will be disgusting after 40 minutes, as my wife and I did. The ignorant masses can be entertained by the derogatory arguments and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without a logical reason for the right science). I am insulted by such nonsense offered under the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the authors picked up a quantum physics book, did not understand a word, then watched the Thema about a thousand times and continued this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, the Washington DC crime experiment was done by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will reveal the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
