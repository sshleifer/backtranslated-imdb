A youth gets a bad hair day, goes out on a hill and falls into where he can't escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" man of 2000 years ago as his best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound look. His Herculean power helps out the boy, and later adjusts to modern life. So what's the big deal? It's the nicest idea for a "family" outing! Either way, this one shouldn't have been completely trying! Our fictional character of power and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger common to the rest of the universe. To add to the blasphemy is the lack of anything new or attractive, and before you know it, there is some attempt at violence that does not entertain it as "family". The scene at which Atlas complained of his underparts, however, slammed. Spend just a leisurely afternoon in the park for a change.
