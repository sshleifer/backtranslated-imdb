Wow, a film about NYC politics apparently written by someone who has never been to NYC. You know there's a problem when, at one moment, you expect the credits to roll and the movie goes on for another half an hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is laughing, and the plot line draws between boring and laughing. A horrible movie.
