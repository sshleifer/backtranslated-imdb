** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher film that doesn't make sense at all, with a murderer walking around, wearing a black cloak and wearing what looks like a Peter Lorre rubber mask. Early in the movie, almost the very first scene, it was reported that young Beth Morgan was in rehabilitation due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was killed in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> It was also reported that FBI Agent Sacker (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with catching the murderer, was also murdered in Tennyson at the same time. By the time the movie "Do You Wanna Know A Secret" wants it, it was never explained what the two murders back in Connecticute were about to hit Florida in about half a dozen collage students a year later? others wearing the murderer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, the same Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> At spring break in the Sunshine State, the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before they know it, they start beating one at a time. Start with the computer-minded Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the killer who is even inundated with the town, with a number of people having nothing to do with the targeted student, including police chief Gavin, Jack McGee, who is cut open. <br /> <br /> The masked killer saves Beth for the last in this strange ceremony at a deserted church, resembling the Florida Everglades. He eventually reveals who he is and what he means, which makes so much sense as the movie does, nobody. To try and scare it, make all the movies busy and confuse it with a number of non-convincing treasures. The most effective people with the victim Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survive at least three attempts at his life and end up with Agent Sacker, the hero of the movie. <br /> <br /> Oz also got a vicious cut from a large luster that almost cut it in half and scratched it, but later he miraculously recovered after being arrested for a murder he did not commit. In fact, he had twice with the killer with him, not so much as having a slight slack in his walk! It also made no sense why Oz and Beth went on their own to catch the killer, rather than calling the police, with a cell phone that Oz had. <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who lost his head over her, in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house. They end up with Beth Oz being the victims of casualties and somehow disappearing out of sight! for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed or if it was some sort of hallucination on Oz or the local police. Up to and including the out-of-the-final scene in the church. <br /> <br /> We also get an insight into a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and acting unpleasant, trying to get it up With Hank like Beth walks in without Hank and Tina even notice. It upset Beth even more when her boyfriend was killed at the start of the movie!
