Author Writer Lisa Lutz wrote the play in 1991 at the beginning of 1991. <br /> <br /> Is she even in business? If someone gave her another chance at this piece of crap, she's the most happy person of eternal award. This movie sucks to NO END ... It never stops me from wondering what the turn in movies is ... and the fact that they have this writer leaves it for a while? Seriously? I can do better if it writes in my sleep. <br /> <br /> So how many lines should I type? I don't get it at all. I think I'm a new beginner. I don't think I understand why there should ever be a limit on what someone has to say ... or a quota. Seriously, I don't care if you have one word sentence. Or even a one-word response. I mean, come on? <br /> <br /> Thank you ... is that enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is worthless.
