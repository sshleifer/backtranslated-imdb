Tatie Danielle is about a terrible old hag that makes her loving and unconscious family painful. There is a bit of sub-text that might be about France's colonial past, but it is mostly only Danielle doing that kind of thing (like deliberately dropping a small child into a park), which will soon be a man with broken fingers will pick up. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen here. It looks good and the acting is good and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just so SMUG. God, this movie loves himself. Sorry it's not nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is. The only impulse in the show - sorry, movie - comes from Danielle to get nastier and nastier, and the only surprise comes from the increasingly unlikely way she does it. That's right: just like in a sitcom, what is it, with the added bonus of delusion of grandeur and a 110-minute run.
