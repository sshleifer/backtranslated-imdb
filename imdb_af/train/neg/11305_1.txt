It is a very bad Western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It seems to have been shot in a background in California instead of where Jack Slade lived, Idaho, Colorado, and Montana. It fixes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man', 'good man'. The writing is terrible; There is very little direction, and common sense. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted than his wife. Mark Steven never looks like portraying this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good podium superintendent. He was feared by his local townspeople for his hard drink. When he was drunk, he started fighting and caused other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure he never terrorized them again, Vigilantes launched Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave immediately. It's a terrible movie. I can't recommend anyone to watch this movie, except to see how Hollywood wants history, even to this day.
