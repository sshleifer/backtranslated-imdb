I didn't know whether to laugh or cry about this misrepresentation of Canadian history, especially the miscarriage done to the history of the mounted police in the Yukon. <br /> <br /> I will be born and educated to Pierre Berton, historian, in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definite history of the Klondike Golden Hare, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my outrage with this silly movie: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an untamed border, muffled by six-gun individual heroes, continued in The Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the American west - Wyoming this time - his herd of beef in goldland. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real irregularity is the main assumption on which the plot is made? that there was only one mounted police officer in the Canadian Yukon at the time of the golden rush and that he could not cope with the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs cabin is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where's the constable, ask Brennan. <br /> <br />" On the Pelly River. Problems with the Chilkats, "someone answers. He has a real hard work, the constable. He patrols about ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he doesn't come home two or three months at a time." <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that during the golden rush the Yukon Territory was the closest thing to a police state that British North America has ever seen. The North-West-mounted police were stationed in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike in the area. They controlled every route in the Yukon and they didn't bring any nonsense. They collected customs duties, often made over the cheeks of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws in place over river navigation and returned the men if they didn't have enough supplies or if they just looked bad. In true Canadian ways, they laid down moral laws for the community. In Dawson the law of the Lord's day was strictly adhered to; It was a crime that was punishable with a fine to cut your wood on Sunday; and fierce young women were arrested for what police called with a sturdy face to give an exciting performance in the theater. In general, there is nothing more than thinking on stage. <br /> <br /> In such a community, a gun was unthinkable. One notoriously bad man from Tombstone who was trying to get a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable, who just pushed him out of a salon for the horrific crime to talk too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb, but protested when the policeman, after discovering he had a gun, said he should hand it over. "Nobody took another gun away from me," the American said. "Well, I take it," the constable generously said and did, without further resistance. So many revolvers were seized in Dawson that they were auctioned by the police for as little as a dollar and bought as souvenirs to keep the mantle. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the big year of the stampede there wasn't a serious crime? let alone a murder ?? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith, the Denver trust man, was remarkable. But in the Far Land Dawson is seen as a community without any law, which is a Soapy Smith character from Skagway ?? he called gannon in the picture? can easily control. (In real life, one of Smith's men trying to cross the border, all his equipment has been confiscated and the frog is once again rectified by a mounted police officer). <br /> <br /> In the movie, the lonely Mountie says, "Yes, I'm the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square kilometers of it." <br /> <br /> "Why is it no longer yours?" <br /> <br /> "Because it was yesterday, it was a desert. We didn't expect you to go through the thousands. Now that you're here, we protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> "There will be a post in Dawson in early May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between May? will be here to maintain order? "<br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" What about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br /> "Choose yourself a good man. Put him in. Let him act as a marshal? <br /> <br /> The movie Mountie does not appear and does not appear in the picture again. His amazing proposal? That an American village officer, Taken with a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence, they accept Jimmy Stewart the marshal, he clearly fits the part, but Stewart plays the role of Loner looking at number one and Another man is chosen to be shot, and he does it, others are shot, and even Walter Brennan is shot, Stewart finally comes to the unwilling conclusion that he has to end all blasting with some of his own shootings. He pegs on the can of star and he and The bully, Gannon, blows away in the inevitable Western climax. <br /> <br /> For anyone with a passing knowledge of the Canadian north, it tells bare again the story of rational faith. <br /> <br /> • Extract from Hollywood's Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
