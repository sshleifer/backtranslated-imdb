Man after man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart in the right place, it strives to be epic and it has a message that everyone will probably appreciate. But there are also some of the problems with this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get the message about it, sometimes the viewer has to feel unusual. It is only sufficient that the images used by this image are simplistic. Man-to-Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but hammer his message in his head. Joseph Fiennes illustrates this in his role: he does his best to worry, move completely and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression that offers his repertoire. Add to that the movie remains and loses its speed towards the end. It will easily come to the conclusion that Man after Man is not worth looking at. But there are enough points to defend it: it's entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you shouldn't compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you'll accompany the scene. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and passes most of the time.
