I'm generous to give this movie 2 stars. The line about "have you seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with horrible writing and acting as shown in this movie, it is no wonder that so much is recorded by worthless TV reality courts. Do yourself a favor and come out of the house and hit a royal baseball game, you'll be glad you did!
