I can't believe that an oblique, jingoistic material is being conveyed to the Americans as artificial material. Early on, from such lines as "we want to make sure they play for the right team" and manipulative framework and lighting, showing a love split it is the right face. The crass way in which Irish Catholics are regarded as hegemonies, the Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is so poorly portraying history as early US westerns depicting the battle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted by the stereotypes and absolute destruction of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption allowed by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people still think today that they can win moral swing by recognizing such a film so easily that it obviously intends trying so far from art. This movie has no business in any legitimate theater or library.
