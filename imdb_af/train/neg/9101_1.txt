This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark." Take the language and themes that are not naughty, and you are left with dialogue and plot devices insulting the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "Saved by the Bell" as quality television. The dialogue was so sneaky and dirty. One might think the script was the product of closing Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with commands to produce an amalgam of every bad script that everyone had a hand to create. If it was Roger Kumble's intention, get the mission.
