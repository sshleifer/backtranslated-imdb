I'm glad I rented the movie for one reason: the shortcomings caused me to read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Before: the movie is beautiful, the period is well and consistently depicted (to my best knowledge) and Meryl and Glenn do good work. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: This is the worst acting work I've ever seen of Jeremy Irons - I wondered if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terrible English way he says Transito.) Winona Ryder does nothing credible, but looks young and idealistic. Most other shows are OK, but so few things are related to the character bows and the relationship development that I was frustrated and angry with the end. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm curious if this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I might have dropped a few more dollars to rent Smilla's snow.
