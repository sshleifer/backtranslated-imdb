First, I must admit Batman: The animated series is by far the best batman series. We watched it when it was earlier on TV. I didn't realize there was a season four. Actually, there wasn't. BTAS ends with season 3, and it had to stop there. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to waste a good thing? Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible gray faces. The Joker looks scary, it seems that every time he revises his appearance, he looks more and more creepier. He no longer seems to have pupils, and now he doesn't even look far off human, though. <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is spoken by Kevin Conroy who is the best batman. Although he looks like superman now. There's nothing that sets him apart, because they look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night wing really needs a cut, please! Alfred has only eyes of students, looks more like an 80's character. <br /> <br /> I watched three episodes of Disc 1 in the series and I already find this version more violent and graphic (there is blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: The animated series, there's no batman season 4. They included this series just as season 4 for marketability. If they just released it as the New Batman adventures, I don't think so many people would have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the disappointment and keep up the seasons 1-3.
