I have to admit that I've caught this one a few times on the US network. There's just something about the, now, sheer stupidity of this movie that shows me when it's going on. Yes, you are right about the sub-pairing, the plot that can only be seven years old, etc. But I can't help feeling sympathetic to some of the actors. Then again, some of these actors reported for the even more horrific successor.
