After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was rather funny, and in my opinion, better than the animated. But there was actually no need for a second one. First, when Cruela comes back, don't heal her and make her mad again. Just get her out of jail and it's a rap. I thought it wasn't very funny. It's supposed to have just one original puppy back. I expected it to be happy, as he was the most attractive, and also Roger and Anita back. However, they decided to get a complete review and not a hundred, not even one hundred, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that he thinks is a dog. Gerard Depardieu's part was useless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is baked inside a huge cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, and attempted to imitate the same effect from the first one. It just didn't work. It was too much at the top and not too funny. I actually felt sorry for Cruella.
