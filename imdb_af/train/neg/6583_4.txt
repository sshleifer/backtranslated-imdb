Interesting idea and storyline that doesn't quite work. <br /> <br /> If you see the movie, you might feel dissatisfied with the end as I did. I didn't really know who to root in the movie, Taye Diggs looks bored as the detective, the rest of the characters look so one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> As Alicia's victim (Mia Kirschner) was more of a pretty girl, we really enjoyed unfolding the plot and the perpetrator brought it to justice. The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, who turned to sweet girl to create opportunistic cake head. I can't understand the moral message of this movie, and as a detective story and player it doesn't work.
