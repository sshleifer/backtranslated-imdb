Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of horror movies. I never see them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen happy feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? Anyway, we didn't actually expect it to be good ... we actually went to just laugh at it. Cool with me ... I have a problem with the movie for other people in the theater, but since it was just other couples talking and making, it didn't matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes the 2 other people went to sleep in Borat, a movie I liked to have seen about this again. The movie wasn't terrible and not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It wasn't awful like Baby Genuises terrible, it was terrible like ... not entertaining at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but it looks like the horror industry problem these days is that you can have a PG-13 horror that's boring and not scary, or you can A horrible horror movie that is either too blood or horrible for people. <br /> <br /> You want a PG-13 horror that sucks but is funny? See "The Wrudge." Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it can literally lead you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
