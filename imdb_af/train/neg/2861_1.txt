I can't believe I wasted my money on renting this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it never got better. The acting, the music drowned the actors. Horrible. Save Your Money! You have to read the movie by bc. They knew the music would drown the talking lines. I never got the part of the butchery or the need to continue to show that cows and pigs are slaughtered. What did it have to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors / actresses in this movie. The writing would have been in the first page of reading. It would be better to keep paint dry.
