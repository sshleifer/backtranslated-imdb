I really wanted this movie, but so much of it is stolen / borrowed from other work - some of the loans are painfully blatant. The New York Times review pointed out that their singing frog is reminiscent of one in the well-known Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hello my baby, hello my darlin", hello my ragtime gal ... "). But I challenge someone to watch the Fox / Blue Sky animation feature robots (2005) and don't find ridiculous similarities: storyline - A young inventor grows up and a single innovative corporation spreads all good inventions. <br /> <br /> cityscape - Many similar camera angles capture many similar futuristic city environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - The washbasin robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to that in Robots, and both films use a kind of retro-futuristic look. It seems to be in sharp contradiction with the silly quote from Disney at the end. This implies that the company is a steady innovator who never looks back (which also violates their entire catalog of 90s movies, which were almost clones apart, with a few small tweaks to storyline and ethnicity. <Br / > <br /> The filmmakers don't seem to be able to speak the story themselves, and are constantly sending objects and sounds flying in our direction, as though we didn't have the attention span for anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated, and he is a pleasure to watch, and much of the rest of the movie looks alike, some of the provinces look like CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts with a classic Mickey Mouse, and by the end of this cartoon we are reminded that Disney never had much interest in innovative or good storytelling - they just seem to be on the big screen get enough of their virtue.
