I should qualify that title, now that I think about it. Completion is not completely worthless. I had the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I got a big laugh at the film's cost. so I think it's worth it. And it's also worth the turbulent pain that caused me on my first sight. As another reviewer pointed out, this film is hacked in every sense of the word. Not a single original thought went into this movie (commenting on the originality of the point of view that amazes me completely). the film is nothing more than a long series of cliches that are joined together as a movie. It's definitely not the following clerks, it's definitely not original, and it's absolutely not "good, clean fun." The movie is absolutely uncomfortable for the uninitiated (after being seen for the first time, the second time can be very funny, offensive). As I watched the theater, it was clear that almost everyone, who might have excluded the elderly, was completely bored or annoyed by this movie. During some of the extraordinary emotional scenes, such as Nick's mother watching, the audience was cracked because it was so weak. I even heard someone in the theater, something I've never seen before. I don't care where you have the chance to see this movie, whether at a movie festival, or in an indie theater, or anywhere. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie with revenge. unless you are like me and just can't stand the chance to see what is probably the worst movie ever made.
