(several spoilers follow) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly. Not Georges Guetary, sometimes criticized for being too young and non-French. Not Leslie Caron, who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance. Not even Oscar Levant, who irritates me more often than not. <br /> <br /> No, it will definitely be Gene Kelly. There is something about his keen son who is too ambitious and aims to be convincing as a foreign artist in Paris. He is content to express the critics indefinitely, fluttering and painting little children and old ladies. It made him so effective in Singin 'in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious, focused characters. Jerry Mulligan is in some ways a cousin to Tommy Albright in BRIGADOON, another Lerner story with Kelly miscarriage as an American loser who falls in love with a picturesque European place and an innocent woman who embodies his virtues. <br /> <br /> Except that Jerry is not as equal to even shabby Tommy. This is another thing about this movie. Jerry is sometimes a cad for Milo, and even worse for Lise. When he sees the latter at a club, he pulls a dirty trick to make her dance. When she sits down again, he pulls an even fuller trick to get her phone number. When he calls her the next day, she hangs on him, which he takes as an indication of falling into her workplace. And it goes without saying that she doesn't want to do anything with him. When she started her jokes in the perfume shop, it was as credible as Milo's interest in his paintings. Certainly, he is beautiful and playful, but why should it swing her when she has Henri, who looks like a gentleman to launch? <br /> <br /> It is unpleasant because of the actress. If a role like Lise is played by, say, Judy Garland, she'll let Jerry down with indignant insults and glares. If she was played by Cyd Charisse, he would admire his bowels. But when played by first reader Leslie Caron, she looks like a shy, vulnerable teenager, and as a result, Jerry just looks like a creep. And why did they choose these other actors (although I'd rather they change things by changing the head) when the whole story depends on the romance of these two young poor lovers who detach themselves from their loveless obligations to older rich people ? Not only is Gene Kelly a few years above Guetary and Foch, he's old enough to be Caron's father. <br /> <br /> In short, I think everything would have been improved by throwing a few young comic relief type dancers such as Jerry, the kind who usually appeared in musical supporting roles ... eg Ray MacDonald in GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van in a SMALL CITY GIRL. Maybe not necessarily them, but someone likes them. Someone who chased Lise and it seemed to be harmless; someone who would really have been happy to appear in that Chaplinesque hole in the wall; someone whose humor and naivety could better contrast with Oscar Levant's sarcastic grumpiness. It would probably also have made the ballet look less unnecessary. And it could provide a voice that Gershwin could sing better. <br /> <br /> All this can give the impression that I don't like Gene Kelly. I love him. He was great in most of his films, not this one (well, and some others). Neither do I despise AAIP itself; It has good points, such as the art direction. And Leslie Caron, who, despite her inexperience, is quite charming, looks like she just walked out of a painting. Georges Guetary does a good job and his "Trap to Paradise" is my favorite number in the movie. Nina Foch is beautiful and touch and must have ended with SOMEBODY. But not Jerry Mulligan. I wouldn't have wanted it on her.
