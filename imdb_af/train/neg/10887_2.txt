...... this movie is pretty awful, the only thing stopping me from giving it a score of 1 was the fact that I have seen worse. <br /> <br /> The jungle music, dark demons, and fluorescent UV-style blood / teeth / eyes give it the "terrible" look, and the writing is bad ..... this movie is more like a test to see how long you can take before giving up. It is also predictable but not in a good way. Nothing this movie does is in a good way. I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought I'd make a little rant, so there you are. (oh and the acting doesn't make the movie down, it's terrible too)
