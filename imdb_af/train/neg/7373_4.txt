I don't know what the rest of you are watching Steven Seagal movies, but I look at them because they are as foolish as they are, they are always nice. Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing, when that sort of thing is exactly what makes such a movie into a cult lover you can laugh at the sobs of? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is by no means a good movie, but I felt it was worth so many of its other films as a Steven Seagal vehicle. In fact, I didn't think it was one of his worst in a long shot. It had half a coherent plot line most of the time, and it was mostly exciting. The end really sucked, but even that had some fun turbulent elements. Eventually, the story itself did not teach what it had promised, but I actually thought that the acting, characterization (if I used such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​gave exactly what a real Steven Seagal of would expect. Seagal in particular was exactly the stone-confronted, relentless man we expected, and the rest of the roll made him well-groomed without ever erecting him. That, people, is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Handle it. Or even better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
