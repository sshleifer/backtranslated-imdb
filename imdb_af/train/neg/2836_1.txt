I shoved this obvious sklock fest on a video store. And before I got my first video recorder, I thought I'd baptize it with this jewelery player and it's bad movie recording at its best! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is accidentally hilarious. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable. And like Christopher Walken, he seems to want to die in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It contains lines like, "Shut up and let me Fight !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You say very sh_it!" <br /> <br /> And the valuable comeback: "Unfortunately, it's a bit angry!" <br /> <br /> You'll be devastated by a battle scene, because Bo does a SUMMER AULT over a billiard table. ! And kick a nice kung fu when she comes out of the roll! Chop socky action a T a A thrills !!! <br /> <br /> What shocking movie fan can ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost, does she ask him why he'd rather murdered himself and then went to his debilitating disease? He says, "True men don't eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yes. If Bo was a clever cookie, she would have called an exorcist, then and there!
