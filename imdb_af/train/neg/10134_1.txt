Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material, but with each passing release they get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This one starts with Seagal being picked up by the FBI for killing a few people in self-defense. Active military has been jailed to save a stealth Stealth aircraft that will be used by the clich√©'s evil English villain, that Hollywood is so obsessed with engaging these days. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say the movie has terrible dialogue that is almost always delivered with a massive topping of cheese and lack of acting. The story is not interesting and there are segments of it that make absolutely no sense and nothing adds to the story, characters of the movie as a whole like the lesbian interaction between the two main women in the role there is purely for titration to get viewers, and yet it's not even titrating just confusing, because it doesn't matter if it happened when it didn't need it. <br /> <br /> In short, a horrible script with a bad dialogue, delivered by sub-ready actors, boring and sometimes badly choreographed action scenes, and non-relevant parts that only serve to reach the impossible and make the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and give it a miss, even if you are Seagal's most fiery fan.
