As a regular movie guard I can't say I enjoyed it. It's not too emotional for a drama, not to grab a thrill, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible. OK, I understand, soldiers are out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, in the midst of a hostile city, characters and after running away from a professor's wife, without ask a question (in a right way). It looks very romantic if it's an animation or something, but it's supposed to be a serious movie about the war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it is just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs a lot of work. <br /> <br /> It seems like the filmmakers want to create an image of an emotionally brave soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology simply seem unnatural. <br /> <br /> This photo left a question in my mind: WHY? Why did they give it an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO this is the most exciting part of the movie :)
