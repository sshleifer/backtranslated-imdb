There is no question of spoilers for this movie, the director also hit us all and spoiled this film in as many ways. <br /> <br /> A blatant rip-off of things like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails at so many levels to regain the humor and horror of the better-made movies. It ends a wasteful waste of time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who sometimes throws stuffed toys with them. They struggle with the same toys in the same way old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles as they shouted and tried to make them look slightly threatening. It is painful to watch, and not helped by the spiritual 80's fashions worn by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little strangers are trapped by an aging security guard in the year of childbirth, and start telepathic with people's minds. The guards, the new site, the idiot they broke out despite repetitive warnings, get his gang of 80's friends together and they go down and gather underage adventures while trying to regain the Grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> Life is here, with the gang consisting of a knocklehead jock, the 80-year-old girl of her 80s, the hero's cute and brave girl, and the young hero who lacks confidence and wishes his girlfriend will in any case protrude. <br /> <br /> First of all, the notorious rake battle scene, where the former military jock shows how he is trained in the army to be a bully, stuck to the nerd hero with the wrong end of a rake make for what looks like hours. Then a few walk around, ending in a real pie-fighting style that ends in a wacky nightclub with comedy hand grenades that blow everything, except people are right next to them. Then the film ends sorta, and altogether, it ends well. <br /> <br /> That's not. It's like watching a train wreck, you can't take your eyes out of it, it's so bad. Perfect prize for Mystery Science Theater, but God-fearing, try to see it alone and uncut. The fashionable police still have a number of outstanding responsibilities for the cast, and I dare anyone not to fight completely. This score counts 2 out of 10 on a good day.
