I watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was so funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's about women working at a company and their boss, and they eventually give a taste of their own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The play is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80 stars who play a good bad guy, not really angry, just unlikely. Dolly Partin is fun and fun to watch comedies and her south-white is really here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does little to me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and laughed me aloud a few times, needs to love her. <br /> <br /> I can recommend it to anyone who likes 80's comedy. I like the movie, but it has things I don't like. It starts well and has a good flow and then everything starts to come together and I care less about the characters. They all have some fantasies about what they want to do and although "cute" I just thought it slowed down the movie of the movie. As the movie goes on, it is picked up again and the funniest things happen and then slowed down, just to turn up quickly. It's too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you haven't seen it. I think, depending on man's mood, it can be more or less enjoyable.
