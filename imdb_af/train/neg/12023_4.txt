Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who has been in a spiritual asylum for over a decade after being found to have asked the back roads with blood on his hands. The doctors want to test an experimental new drug that will return its lost memories if it works. But when the drugs give him devil's hallucinations, he chooses to escape rather. While outside, he was friends with a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) abused his mother. He will not leave her near the darkroom in his basement and generally suspect. <br /> <br /> While the general "riddle" of the movie is a little easy to identify way before it is revealed, I found that Mr Diamond's play is sufficient to keep my attention throughout. (For the sake of full disclosure, I've been a big fan of her since the murder and his brief but vital role in The Shield by Journeyman & Dollhouse). Not a good movie or a good one, but enough service. Although I liked it better than the previous movies I saw from director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eyebrow: One short pair of boobs in a hallucination <br> /> <br /> My Degree: C-
