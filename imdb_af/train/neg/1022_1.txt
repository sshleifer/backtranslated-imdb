Starting with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a scam. One stereotype after another, this movie was just about nothing - or nothing new. After 10-15 minutes, you realize you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J. Review them by another cop-flick. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of the corrupt system in some city, all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town, is under the watchful eye of a hot shot politician. The almighty and top-level organization is called FRAT and guess what? They shot a kick-ass loony cop and knock at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. VROU police are corrupt and greedy, so they eventually make mistakes discovered by a young and talented journalist. An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad shooting and more stereotypical lines, everything ends up happy and we get the final line: you can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this wasted movie roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes!
