Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unacceptable. His fame regrets me. Nothing comes out as a high point except Chinatown (I didn't see 'Knife in water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he made to film was closed more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> R's baby has meant the end of the business when it came out. It is luxuriously crafted and fairly high concept for a 1968 horror film (never see the baby). But it's just mishonceived horror juice. Everything is about to make the plot line hopelessly clear (Um, thank you for the final destructive title), and on a clear day you can see the turn ending for days. It didn't keep my interest. I find that everything this movie could have been completely distracted by the 1960's version of what was feminine. Farrow is such a chronic derivative, helpless waif / housewife. Her weakness is oversold ... she is irritating in the extreme. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider except the devil's mother. <br /> <br /> The Dakota is almost exploited for its ominous potential.
