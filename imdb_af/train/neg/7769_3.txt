A real scraper of a movie by Bill Rebane, which got worse in his 1980s trading. Three crackers of millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to take part in a final game in which the final contestant receives $ 1 million, provided he or she does so far. A series of lame pranks are being drawn on some of the guests while the others are involved in what most adults would do under the circumstances, namely, they are pleasing to the hotel bar. Most scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on different female body parts, including an opening band number that is a crossover from American Bandstand, compliant with geriatric aerobics filled with hookers. If there was any doubt that white people cannot dance this scene, the last nail hangs in the coffin. Pay close attention to the nipple slip. It takes about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts at various plots and whatever he touches becomes the inspiration for the next scene that makes this one dull mess. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old dots are in full control until it is not. The hotel is in possession of a supernatural force until it becomes only props. They are dead until they do. Even the narrator at the end answers that he does not know what the hell happened. I'm telling anyone to argue where Rebane goes on this one. The play is dinner caliber minus the meal. Most of the actors have probably returned to their work at the local Stuckey's. I give it a few points to the scene where the yuppie opens wide the closet and a skeleton is inside the skull that bumps it. Let's see Gone With the Wind do it! This Chilling Classics collection is really my job. Tracks, get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
