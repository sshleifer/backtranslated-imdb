... Have you ever been. It's the bottom. I'm not joking. The theater had to have some kind of warning. "Leave all hope you enter here" would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I don't have the words to describe hell what this movie is. The weakening stupidity even fails to enjoy. This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story has been blatantly stolen from a 10 minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched out like Mr. Fantastic up to 90 ominous painful minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when the Wayans were funny. I think Hollywood's pressure for them to produce produce is the fault of the shit that eliminates it at a consistent rate. I'm sad and offensive that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of in-the-ball jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon. <br /> <br /> I almost finished everything from this movie. . I won't spoil anything, but the baby is actually a little while with Marlon Wayans' face weak on the midget's body. What I did was the end. Not the movie's resolution, but the real end where we all got up and out. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie one star, but it deserves less. I don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script are worth a star. It deserves a raid and I pray until God gets it. <br /> <br /> When will people learn; If you stop paying to see this idiot, they will stop popping. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You're warned.
