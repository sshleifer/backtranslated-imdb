A Bel girl testifies to a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious role here: his camera sneaks around corners in a museum (after a long time about a painting of a monkey), divvies in split screen for arty purposes, gives practically his plot away with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters both watch a TV program on transsexuals, and stages his (first) final during a thunderous rainstorm. "Dressed To Kill" is exhausting, mainly because it asks us to swallow so much and give nothing back. Many of the plays (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) are mediocre and the (second) final is a partition of De Palma's own "Carrie" - not the name "Psycho". The explanation of the dirty act plays like a ghost of Hitchcock, not a tribute. Stylish in a cold way, the end result is clearly half-baked. ** of ****
