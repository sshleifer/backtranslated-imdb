Don't waste your time on this drink. As depicted, the characters have no redeeming values ​​and see how they interact, is pure torture. "Gothic" was at least entertaining, it's crap. If you like to look at pretentious and spoiled poets, which are abundant to persuade one another, it may have risen upright. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is really confusing. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any backbone whatsoever, but even she comes from all the trials without our respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember a superior movie based on the same subject but didn't capture the title. I was hoping it was, but not so lucky. Not recommended.
