Blank Check is easily one of the worst movies of the nineties. The plot is completely useless; his overtones of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really think a 12-year-old who acts as a personal millionaire assistant can achieve everything in this movie, such as buying a home for only $ 300 grand. The idea, let alone the bargain basement price, will only be believed by the most faithful viewers. Please respect your intelligence and do not look at this terrible, horrible movie.
