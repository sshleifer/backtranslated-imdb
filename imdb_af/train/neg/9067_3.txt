Although I had some hope on this movie, especially since I enjoyed Jason Segel's (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I must say it was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory (Loser and Dr T and the women are also on the list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were a few laughing moments, though the movie might have been so much better. The point of departure was not bad - scam artists bothering their way through college meet their game when they are discovered by someone with a suggestion for them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikely that I didn't care about any of them. The extortionist (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it was not so funny to see him. He was not in a very funny or beautiful way, he was just a crazy loser, who was actually quite dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the movie was difficult to follow - it cut between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear what was. Only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown, you just had to believe they were indeed scam artists - which would make their schemes a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible; it was actually stupid and poorly written and corrected throughout. I can go to the movie's shortcomings, but you get the idea. Not renting the $ 4 or the gas needed to drive to and from the movie shop!
