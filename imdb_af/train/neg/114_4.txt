It's not the throw. A finer group of actors, you couldn't find. It's not the environment. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the movie, so we are all! Woody Allen couldn't improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you're going to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the writing. There is nobody. The actors are in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood, this is what happens when they go to work on the set. This is the reality for him and his peers, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the film is hollow, and level, and message-less.
