I have always been somewhat underpowered by Joe Dante's original THE HOWLING (1981)? so I wasn't particularly interested in checking any of his successors; Some time ago I caught HOWLING III: DIE MARSUPIALS (1987)? by the same director as this one ?? and find it to be vigilant, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> However, the second installment has quite a bad rep and I knew I had a good time watching it ?? rather than turning in the eyes of the dear, but pumping horror icon, Christopher Lee, in the middle of it all, stifled (the graceful old star was pathetic in several interviews that he did not appear in horror-oriented tariffs since his last photo for Hammer Films back in 1976!). Anyway, this movie should have the subtitle "Your Movie Is A Turd"? amazingly incompetent in all sections (start with the all-important werewolf phenomenon)! <br /> <br /> The plot (and dialogue) is not only terrible but it has the slackest connection with Dante's movie ?? Strangely enough, the author of the original novel Gary Brandner wrote it himself! Still, one of the unmistakable highlights (there are ... lows) of the movie is the senseless elliptical editing? trying to give the whole a look at the style, but just to emphasize its embarrassing factor! Similarly, phones (and lattice) are the hokey transitions between scenes, the inane punk-rock theme song, and the cheapjack special effects at the climax! <br /> <br /> What about the characters, then ?: Lee is the werewolf expert, of course, who's all thinking of a crackpot? until they come into contact with the samples, that is; At least, you must admire the creators' ingenuity (or gall) in designing a dual subtitle subtitle! Incidentally, Sybil Danning (such as Stirba, Werewolf Bitch, the subtitle it is known in the UK!) Is picking up in a variety of outrageous S&M outfits ... but her character is almost given nothing to do not (except preside over her followers and involve the occasional hilarious three-way lycanthrope sex!); her two speeding lieutenants (one of them a messy black girl) is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> Helping Lee on the side of the good is the two yuppie heroes (he is the brother of the Dee Wallace character of the first movie and she is a colleague of her) and a relaxed guerrilla -Type of Transylvians band (they mostly succeed in overcoming Danning's dull werewolves effortlessly!). Remarkably among them is a knife-throwing dwarf that gets a particularly nasty (but at the same time splitting) downfall; He was later revived, under Stirba's control, to lure Lee (by making childish embarrassments on him through the village street) in a fall. The latter must be a career for the distinguished and striking actor ?? Well, either this or the early order in a disco where Lee is made to make an ultra-cool sunglasses so that it looks unobtrusive among the party youths! <br /> <br /> In the end, if I'm forced to mention elements that aren't quite dissatisfied. I think I can say that the ossuary (in which the heroine is to be sacrificed) is interesting, or that the hybrid wolf / bat (Danning's pet who likes to inhabit "the body of his victims") is just too strange to despise. become ...
