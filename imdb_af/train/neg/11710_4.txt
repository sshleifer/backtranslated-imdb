There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this slow and unlikely story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, movie stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed woman who decides to take revenge on her cheatin spouse. Oh, but not in a conventional way. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. She wants Nichole (as Tuesday) to come near her ex (the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins, who should keep music) to embarrass him and destroy his life. David DeLuise is good in his few short moments, and former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison is almost nothing to do, but a shock. Hiltz on the other hand comes in as sexy and playful at different times, then evil and unholy. She also treats vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic" well. She is also very hot (although there is no naughty bit of being) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she's aimed for. But the show is kind of wasted in this movie, which just isn't edgy or interesting enough to recommend.
