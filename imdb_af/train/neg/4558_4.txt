Honestly, I was disappointed in the "expiration date." Super clever title and interesting prospect, but I don't think it was delivered. What was it about? The main character's desire to reconnect with his native roots? Or more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But he was not raised as someone who lived his life in fear - his life seems to be going well, but since the day of death he has to start worrying. I didn't buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did not need to be mixed in an overarching story. They all just did their thing, parallel to the main character. Also, what was considered a "curse" seems more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan to stay in his apartment all day all day? This is my criticism, but I loved Seattle's shots, cinematography was beautiful, acting well in the times it wasn't outstanding.
