I saw this movie at the mysterious science theater when it was called "It stays at night". That title is far less misleading than "baton". In fact, it would be better called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. It's not really clear. What is clear is that he and his wife take a cruise in the cave and he is bitten by a bat. Why a scientist must take a tour to study bats is outside me. Must not enter himself. Well, after he was bitten, he and his wife went on their honeymoon, where he began to fit. They're going to the worst doctor ever. The man stays in hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the man kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you have to root him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
