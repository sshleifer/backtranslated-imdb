I hired this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack made a movie with David Lynch and Timothy Leary, it would be the end. result. I don't think I've seen a movie like that that made a LSD trip, looks like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It's a bunch of pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality, or different realities, and the movie doesn't end up until the last 5 minutes, where it suddenly makes sense. I have a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives away everything and I won't do it here. It's a well-educated piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say, if there is one detached feature for this movie, it's the music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogue is incredibly good, and incredibly bad all at the same time. <br /> <br /> I enjoy parts of this movie, I really did, and once you get to the end, you'll actually find out what's really going on. It's a pity you have to take 2 hours to get an important point, which reduces the effect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not acting, that's all.
