Mona the vagabond remains on the brink of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I watched it because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while it becomes rude, tall and nothing to anyone's life through life. She is not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. <br /> <br /> I've seen and known so many people: there is no secret meaning to what they do. They're just lazy bombs. I don't want Mona anywhere near me, because she tends to steal something that isn't nailed and leaves her friends down. Surely she's mysterious - because there's nothing to her. Many junkies, winos and bums I've seen are mysterious; I also don't want to see a movie about them. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there's something I've completely missed. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews of people who accept everything done by a French female director are high art.
