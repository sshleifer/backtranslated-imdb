I find it hard to believe that someone will put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the Exorcist was subtle and creepy, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy and formulated. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen for a while, but the images don't make up for the downward spiral of patronizing outline that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this movie was over when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased that interest. The site had many stories of "real" stigmata throughout history. But the scene at the scene, the film is so obsessive by its search for "authenticity" that it initially comes comical, then straightforward to look at the end. I began to be suspicious when the priest charged with investigating possible miracles was going to walk into the beauty room where our heroine cut her hair and apparently flirted with priests. <br /> <br /> The plot: A woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the Stigmata) and is amazed and upset about the trial. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie owned by Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it eventually ends.
