Another movie about a group less than intelligent individuals on a road trip that turns off their original itinerary for a short cut or, in this case, a downward side-view attraction. The results, as expected, are not good at all, as this particular show is home to a bunch of turbulent residents who escaped from prison many years ago. The father, who is believed to be a professional photographer, should just stop taking pictures of the place, just to find that it is still inhabited. The different members of the family wander off to see the various attractions, just to be scared. Think they made it safely on the road, exploding the tires (surprise!), And allowing them to seek refuge and lodging in the village, which we find out, is just inhabited by the freaks (surprise!). <br /> <br /> This movie plays as expected with the family stalking and killed by the freaks. There are some setbacks to the family, but it's probably among the worst plays in the movie, as they are badly executed. There is nothing original here originally, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack played during certain scenes that completely destroy the atmosphere and mood of the movie. The play is about as bad as I've seen for some time by all those involved (it's pretty bad when your cast is out of the role of Camp Blood). The special effects are mean and the end made me punch my television. <br /> <br /> Even so, despite all the negative things, I enjoyed a bit of this movie. It definitely has a "so bad it's a good vibe." I made it through the whole movie and was even enjoyable when I passed the ridiculous clich√© plot, horrible acting, and cheesy special effects. Although the end felt annoyed and angry, especially because the film was not so good to start and the end made the whole movie meaningless. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I can call many movies that if you saw it, you saw it. The difference is that most of the movies are better. Although not a complete waste, this film is very bad and not scary. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
