Looking back at my university days at Ohio University, there will always be one opportunity to remember with good memories. Channel 23 is OU's local access channel and until the last few years they have played anything they have sent. It includes many DIY movies, ranging from a Marshmallow Peeps man and then scanning photos from them online, to a Macbeth version of 8th. They apparently just learned how to make squibs. <br /> <br /> But the king, in my opinion, of the Channel 23 series was Midnight Skater. The first time I looked, it was about 2am. I had to study. Or sleep. Or watch regular TV. But no, everything for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was finished, I didn't think any of us believed any of the movies had just happened. But sure enough it was a few nights later, and we had to find out that this movie did exist. <br /> <br /> I could go on with how terrible it is, but it's the kind of horrible thing that makes life worth living. The plot is untouched, the acting horrible, all that soul shaves, but by God, if there are others who look at you, it is impossible not to look at a good time. It's like the first time you've heard "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you get disgusting and shaken, but five minutes later, everything you want and desire is to let someone else experience the terrifying horror you've just endured. <br /> <br /> Short story short, Midnight Skater, for all its epic mistakes, make for a lot of late night fun. Plus, I desperately want the theme for midnight skater. Kudos to whom it wrote and sang it. Sweet God I love the song.
