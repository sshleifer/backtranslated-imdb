*** THIS IS LOTS OF MANY MANY spoilers, not in terms of it, as everything is so perverse. <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here - this is the first time I've ever come home from a movie and said, "I need to get IMDb and write a review of it. This is my civil duty." This is the bad thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> * start digression * But let me just say one thing before I start. I'm not a Harvard art main film noir weenie (I actually went to college across the Mass. Ave in Cambridge, the one where the real smart people go without rich daddies and trust funds , which would place me squarely in the nerd-who-want obsessive-love-comic film census group, and still I hated this movie ...). My show preference is for the highbrow movie oeuvre which includes The Hards, Bond flicks, Clerks, and the Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lost lives, but we would not be subjected to the hype of a movie. And the only reason I would see a snooty French art film is if there is a young and regular Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave a Maximum Overdrive one of his precious few 10's here on IMDb for the sake of God. So I'm as level as they come, so I'm not criticizing this movie, because I'm looking for a standard of film excellence - that's because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. * End digression * <br /> <br /> OK, there are so many bad things to try to categorize. Go here: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons why a man wants a man wants to see this movie is to see very hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted it). I think that between this and "Finding Nemo" the latter was the sex movie. You know the red outfit she advertised in every freaking ad you see? You see her in it TWICE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. In the rest, she actually looks like Morrissey looks like he was a female - lots of pouting and black clothes. This brings me to the incredible variety of expressions JGar shows in her acting - from "pouting" to "pouting and crying". Oh my God, you'd think she was forced to date Ben Affleck or something so terrible. Um, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BATHROOM / GAL: They show the same variety of expression and acting abilities you expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least alongside JGar's performance, it's not too bad. One man's role is to stand there and be big, others are to stand there and things come out of him, and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe and / or to kiss people. They succeed in subtracting these incredible achievements. The main bad man has the hardest part of everyone - he must one day be a) angry and b) Asian appears. He does a good job here. I think there was a fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain started to exclude parts of this movie in self-defense. <br /> <br /> PLOT TWISTS! This movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let's say it this way - my wife, who was only half a year in the US and only speaks a small amount of English - whispered it to me when the girl first appeared in JG's way and I swear to God I'm making it no matter: "She goes home to kill a girl. And also father." And that is before the Father even appeared on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but she is not cried by Mensa for her gifts, and she had zero exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she found out in .00015 seconds without producing and no previous information. This is the blatant obviousness of this movie. <br /> <br /> RARELY-PROMOTED STUPIDITY! OK, so there is this big man in the movie. He can blast a chest of shotgun and brush the shot as it is ribbon, and he can take a dirty Electra sting to the chest and just bend the metal (or melt it - or something - more defense kicks in, thank God ). But JG jumps on his head and he explodes? An Achilles Noggin? OK! So is the sensible folly of this movie. <br /> <br /> I start with a cerebral hemorrhage that comes up, so I have to stop. But you're warned. If you intend to cut your own tires deliberately to prevent you from seeing this movie, DO THIS. And if Armageddon is coming, please leave it before it comes out on DVD.
