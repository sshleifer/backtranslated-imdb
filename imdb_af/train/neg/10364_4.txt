The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-up movie will move you, but then, as it deviates more and more from the book, you take out all the religion and love and math, it gets boring. Still, from comments I have heard, people who have not read the book are inclined to keep it, and if it even reads on the Little Child to read a Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love Laugh). Nothing is really as messy as on-screen characters, screaming lazily about things that are totally unfriendly.
