We have an average family. Dad is a well-known rapper, we have the "rebelious teenage daughter", the adopted white child and the cute little child. And we have indifferent housemates, what show did such a roommate have? Do we have a mess Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, mostly because I was young. The music was bad. The rape was so bad and they were too g-rated. All she was raped about his family and friends and problems. The father was kind of the type "Danny from Full House" type dad. Always the council issued. But he wasn't a clean freak. They had a house keeper for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil 'Romeo was in trouble of some kind, or ... it's not. Oh and maybe a preteen drama. Yes, this is good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean can do better.
