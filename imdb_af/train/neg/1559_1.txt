This could be the worst movie. I'll see if I'm 100. I think a group of first-scratches could perform better than a class project like this. I'm stupid because I watched it, and God had mercy on the souls paid to produce this movie. <br /> <br /> And after finally turning it off, I really had the urge to roast. /> <br /> No one had any idea about photography when it was made. Nobody had an idea about acting. Nobody had any idea of ​​anything. <br /> <br /> I can't believe F / X shows this shit on the occasion. The only time I saw it was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the head. And it was about 3 pm.
