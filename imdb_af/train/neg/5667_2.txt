If I checked IMDb before renting this DVD from Netflix, I returned a few hours of my life. I am honestly suspicious when I see that a film's director also wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same man was "writter and director" - unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminiscent of her early comedy routines that Judy-ism focuses on) that led me to judge these two stars rather than one. Those moments were, however, few and far between ... and I hardly saw them, because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to say too vile in his violence. I admit I went again to see if I missed something that would help me figure it out if I saw the whole thing. No, although I at least acknowledged who the characters were later important. The spin camera technique was overused and essentially useless. I talked myself to the TV screen: "What?!?" Or, "Thank you!" Not recommended.
