A family of terrible people should stay in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance going to the servants, who will only get their inheritance if they agree to keep the house in order. People die (and so do you if you try to put it through). If you've ever wanted to see bad actors - many with ill-fitting denture action or attempt to act in a bad horror movie, this is your chance. It's just awful. It's so bad, I thought Al Adamson, one of the worst directors ever, managed it, but I went wrong. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I don't want to say anything more about it, because it's not polite, but because I first started, I might not stop. <br /> <br /> Avoid
