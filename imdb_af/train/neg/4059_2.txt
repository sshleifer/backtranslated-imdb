Rarely is such an incredible throw wasted so much. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped on board. They just had to be tortured by a script that looked nothing more than a Hollywood joke. The use of Martin Scorsese's name for this was probably the draw, but the end result is much less than the sum of its parts. Looks like a terrible nightmare, every scene looks more complicated than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self-sufficient nonsense, and the whole movie is definitely boring .......... NOTE
