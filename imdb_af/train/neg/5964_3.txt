The version of this movie I saw was titled 'Horror Rises from the Tomb'. The abomination in question is a wicked medieval wizard played by Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy, he seems to play Abanazer in a church hall panto. He rises from his grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as he is also played by Naschy) returns to his ancestral home and reunites the wizard's head and body separated by the witchcrafts who executed him in an attempt to stop him, stood out of the grave. <br /> <br /> Obviously, when the head and body are back together, hell becomes bright and many die. Like all good wizards, Abanazer has a lovely assistant here. This one is played by another Spanish horror, the beautiful Helga line. Like virtually every other woman in the film, Line regularly gets her kit off. There is a lot of nudity in this movie, not just feminine - we even see Naschy's paunchy body, which is not pretty, I can tell you. Most of the movie's hexagon is ridiculous for free. There is a particularly funny scene where Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly they both have the naughty young blonde they own. <br /> <br /> It's also beautiful in places - especially a Herschell Gordon Lewis esquire moment where Line puts her hands in a man's chest to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the pretty effective zombies that come to the end. However, they are quickly deterred by a fire and must not return. What a shame. The scene of the zombies, however, is the movie's most ridiculously unknown moment. It all happens in a long shot, and we didn't really have an idea of ​​what was happening before we saw some figures rushing from afar. There are several dumps like this, largely due to poor editing. When a worker falls under the hypnotic game of Naschy's head, there is a big close-up of his face that apparently stays forever and doesn't work. <br /> <br /> All in all, not a big horror movie, but entertaining enough. Of course, the version I saw was a baptized American version that was probably cut into pieces. For everything I know, the original Spanish version can be a masterpiece ...
