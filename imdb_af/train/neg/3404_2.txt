I'm not going to drop this movie for many technical fees, it will take two days to explain how the whole thing is not even possible. Others have already noticed the relevant stupidities. <br /> <br /> Given all that I can enjoy, if they haven't included the maudlin, deceptive, uncomfortable, Disneyesque sentimental shit, which is out of place, but nowhere else than in the space where the slightest mistake can mean immediate death. <br /> <br /> The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their greasy nonsense to anything else. It completely destroyed the value of the production. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised. NASA releases this garbage so that so many people will get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you haven't seen it, save yourself the annoyance. Look again at Apollo 13. At least it was trying to be kind of real.
