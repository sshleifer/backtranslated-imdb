Well, what can I say about this movie. I'm speechless. I can talk about how stupid this movie is forever, though the one thing that actually illuminated ME was the music. And on top of that all of someone commenting on how much they leaked. For them all I have to say is that it has been stripped of one of the best martial arts movies of all time. Fistsof fury with Bruce Lee. If he still lived and ever came across this movie, he was terrified. The rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of band. I say band because a movie could not be shot on film as it might. I now feel more stupid to waste 30 minutes of my life. The only reason I even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it from morbid curiosity. Where does this world come from?
