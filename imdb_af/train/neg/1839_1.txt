I couldn't wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it. When I started it, I couldn't wait to get it out of my DVD player. Actually I watched the movie. My wife and I were waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing was funny. Reading the box like it would be really funny. The assumption of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How to miss this movie? Well .... this is wrong! This is the most uncomfortable "comedy" I've ever seen. No one with whom I spoke was even slightly funny. It's just a very lame movie. Trust me. Avoid it .... avoid it !!
