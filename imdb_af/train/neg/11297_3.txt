Jenny Neumann (from the sex fledgling movie MISTRESS OF THE APES, American shooter HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress starring in an Australian stage production. She is a virgin because she has seen as a girl her mother has sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, a black-gloved killer threatens the theater that sheds people with screens. <br /> <br /> *** BIG SPOIL *** <br /> <br /> Of course, the killer is Helen (she speaks in her dead mother's voice, blood is washed away from her hands to the murders and is seen how a child molester with a broken bottle as a girl is murdered!) but it has free-of-charge POV camera work that breathes heavily and hides the identity of the murderer until the end that it is supposed to be a great surprise be. <br /> <br /> The whole cast looks obsessed with talking, having sex or trying, and in one case even scaring their way around. There is quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no continuity, photography is dark and editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and manufactures) is terrible. The theater environment for a slasher movie is the former Soavi movie of the same name and Argento's OPERA (both are better than this one), but Neumann is quite five years old.
