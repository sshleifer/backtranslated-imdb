Songwriter Robert Taylor (as Terry) is "dizzy, bang-happy" and can't see straight over the worldly Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). "She makes the sun shine even when it rains," explains Mr. Taylor. But, Mr. Taylor gets a lump in his throat when he's near me. Shearer is coming. Finally, at the Palm Beach casino Shearer, Taylor says: "I love you!" Shearer brushes him off as she is engaged to George Sanders (like Tony). However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer Taylor recommends standing as "her cardboard lover," Sanders jealous. <br /> <br /> This movie's title invites the obvious and appropriate three-word review: "Her Cardboard Film". This is especially known as the latest movie feature for Shearer, one of the world's largest stars of "The Who Gets Slapped" (1924, which is another Consuelo) after "The Women" (1939). To be honest, it was probably the kind of Shearer movie MGM who believed audiences wanted to see. However, the part is unobstructed. <br /> <br /> Plucked and powered, Taylor and Shearer were better off in "The Escape" (1940). As Shearer continued, she might have become a better actress than "leading woman"; She was no longer interested and definitely didn't need the money. Taylor has a wonderful scene, reminiscent of Christina Rossetti's "When I Dead, My Learest", while threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, as George Cukor indicated. <br /> <br /> **** Her cardboard lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
