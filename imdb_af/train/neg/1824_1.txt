I don't envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for this movie. This is boring in one word. Perhaps the fact that it is too predictable, the more-than-exploited Ben Stiller's losing role or the non-all-funny scenes, makes this movie just something to forget. Even Christopher Walken's appearance ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's play. I loved it in most of his films, the last one I've seen before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and wasn't that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from High Fidelity, I've never seen him do anything good. What about School of Rock? Oops, scary.
