This movie is really nothing but a well-known series of teams played with an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. There is only the most skeletal motivation for the characters to do anything while doing themselves to their inevitable doom. It's just an excuse to show a horrible ghost child (who hid some of the family cat in his ectoplasm) and his ghostma (with long black hair hanging in her face like "The Ring") a lot of cardboard cuttings, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of movie-like mess; Satisfactory moments, but not really what you should live on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
