OK, as everyone has noticed, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a boring sex-blowing film that cut out many (or obscured) material to escape the judge's X rating; but the film also has many other errors. <br /> <br /> Initially, the author's wolves and vampires seem mixed. The bad things in this movie are harder and do not like silver, but in all other respects they act like vampires. Now you can't do it with a crazy genre movie, you have to adhere to the rules of the genre or the fans are all confused and annoyed by disgruntled in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but does not make sense in a werewolf effect. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the werewolf costumes are the worst ever seen. Anyone in the werewolf film business should know that werewolf costumes and transformations are something that critically evaluates the fans, but some of these werewolves are simply goofy. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good bits. I just kept the score. Others mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing exists) <br /> <br /> I also really wanted the plan to get the werewolf's fortress fall. There are so many horror movies that rely on characters to stupid, but in this case, they get a very sensible and effective anti-weather arsenal and kill the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver dots, and nowadays we have some powerful firearms. Don't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in typical style, this movie goes above and adds some other very zany and amusing anti-lycanthropic weapons.
