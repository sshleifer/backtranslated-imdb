Philip. K. Dickian movie. And a decent one for that matter. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But we can face it, the turning and chewing end was too much for me. Halfway through the movie, I have already started to fear such an end, and unfortunately I was right. But that doesn't mean the movie isn't worth its time. No at all. First half (as many commented here) is wonderful. There are a few areas where you start doubting whether the director intends to convey the message that showcase is very important in the future (we will do such types on corny as we can) or just about combining. But the paranoia is there and also feels "out of joint". Good one.
