She's one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I don't see where this 'not so bad' litter comes. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other dance films out there. It's awful! The name should shout, look. "How she moves." Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, this one doesn't even earn a watch. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously ask someone with an IQ of more than 60 not to see it and not to waste your money. The 1.6 / 10 should tell it all. This movie shouldn't even be made.
