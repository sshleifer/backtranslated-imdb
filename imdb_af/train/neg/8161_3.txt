Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who returned her to her fiery punishment in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie takes place mainly in 1986. The movie falls into the trap of strange / stupid special effects in the 80's, including some strange demented rocking horses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things for people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether she succeeds, you have to look to find out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is largely boring and based on a lot of worthless characters. It's not a successor either. The only thing common to the first is the name of the high school. It has the avg. horror flick falls back, gore, useless nudity, beats against the catholic church. Basic stuff, boring movie. <br /> <br /> The play is decent enough to give it 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
