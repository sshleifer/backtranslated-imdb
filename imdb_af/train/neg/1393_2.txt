I thought to watch work videos on the compliance of the company was annoying. This movie didn't go anywhere fast. What could have been a somewhat cheesy half-hour twilight zone episode has a seemingly endless waste of film on people who could park their cars, a picture of a couple's pool (he really needs his phone in the end answered) a dot matrix printer does its job, and Heuy and Louey sit in a yellow illuminated control room and repeat "T minus 10 and count" as if something exciting is going to happen. It doesn't make your hope. The best thing about this movie is to watch James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than famous TV personalities, and stretch it to find anything good. And don't get me started on the music composed entirely of a Tympani, some great marine mammals, and microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I have given yet, but it becomes the 2 because I was actually able to complete this insomnia cure, and does not have to leave the center. Avoid ALL COSTS.
