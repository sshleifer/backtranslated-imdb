Just like last year's event, WWE's new annual 2006 revolution was launched by an Elimination Chamber game. However, the difference between last year and this year's game was the entertainment value. In fact, only three people had a chance to step out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, with the WWE Championship. These men were current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the smoking money; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane last week held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and it was only for one night. It was clear that he would not be one either. Last year, the contest was an exciting relationship with six of the best WWE offers. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing issue, but still the night game far away. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening came after the clock ran on the main event. Exit Vince McMahon herself and demand that they light the room. It was then announced that Edge was in his money in the bank championship from time to time. With no time to prepare and just win the side of the Elimination Chamber game, John Cena didn't put a chance and dropped the title to one of the most entertaining heels in WWE. It was the only entertaining action that happened all night. <br /> <br /> The undercard, like last year, was really horrific. Triple H and The Big Show sat on a snow party that struggled to stay away. HHH picked up the victory, but was it never in any real doubt? Any pay-per-view that both Jerry Lawler and Viscera struggle on the same card will never have a chance to succeed. The king held on to Helms (who bucks these things?) And Big Fish tasted a defeat against Shelton Benjamin's mess with some help from his Mama. <br /> <br /> The women of the WWE also had a busy night. There were the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet game won by Ashley and the Women's Championship was also at stake. In a game, I thought would have been left to brew to WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good game. Trish won the game, but it was clear that it would continue for the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> The opening game of the night soon hit the WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. It could have been better, but it was an injured and bloody Flair retained after a disqualification. Of course, Edge had bigger fish to roast. <br /> <br /> So New Years Revolution kicked the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in a disastrous way. The only good thing about this is knowing that the WWE is the only way. They don't get much worse than that.
