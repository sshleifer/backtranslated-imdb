This "documentary" is proof that talent is used for average purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in order to seek the truth of what really happened those terrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something we also do not know. /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the directors of these things lie both by omission and by knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex to understand easily by foreign audiences, and they benefit. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * they show pro-Chávez protesters shot on an empty street (how hell did they do that?) In a way to say they did not kill anyone but did not save the images that we all saw, not see here, of opposition protesters (and a journalist) dead or injured on the other side of the "empty" street. They could not explain why the police police helicopter was the only one authorized the day on Caracas to fly and did nothing against the snipers that were over the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, something that would point out how inefficient it would be to protect the President. A few days after the "coup" the head of the army was in charge at the National Assembly (our congress) why they did not act against the snipers and said: "because they were not there to act the president, "isn't this a confession? <br /> <br /> There is so much more, the fact that the highest rankings have announced that Chavez resigned and 2 days later he said he lied because "it is politics" and today the Interior Minister is of Chávez's administration. <br /> <br /> It will take me thousands of words to portray all the lies portrayed in this "documentary" with the aim of making the world a picture of the good old Hugo Chavez who governs the poor and the badly-rich opposition who wants him at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people reject his government and the percentage includes the poor. <br /> <br /> I hope those of you who saw and bought it could see another version made. b y a group of Venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has returned!
