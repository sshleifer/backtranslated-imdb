Worst movie ever made !!! Please see the Real movie reviews of the benefits on this movie. Check out Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this movie. The comments on this site are apparently from people of financial interest in this movie. I find the positive comment very misleading. I find it wonderful how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like a Speech for Academy Awards. Don't waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie has been delayed !! I can't believe a movie like this will ever be made. Why would Hollywood waste their time on such a litter? This movie is an attempt to do nothing. I ask myself which loser would actually sink their money, which would cause such trash. I went and the maid even told us not to waste our time or money. I didn't listen and I wasted my time and money. Please don't make the same mistake! It's really the "worst movie ever made!"
