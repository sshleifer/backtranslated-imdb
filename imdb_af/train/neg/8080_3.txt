I had high expectations for this movie as it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But the expectations crept in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was ridiculous. Not only does Heston's acting or Annabel Schofield's beauty (or short naaktonele) save this movie. Some of the space effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The plot was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans have to hit this one. Grade F
