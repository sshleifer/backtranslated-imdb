Not the greatest film to remember Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro will be ashamed! His only rescue came because the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget about the horror - there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be King. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the movie was to see Graciela Nilson, who first made four films in two years, and disappeared after our miserable loss. Where's she going?
