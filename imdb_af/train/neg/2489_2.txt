STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox policeman who gets results but rots his superior touch. To prevent his partner being murdered at the start of the film, the plot takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico where a top secret American super tank with incredible firepower and image capabilities has been smuggled, just about < br /> <br /> This inexpensive search (even by the 80's), boring little action movie, was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after making an impression as the flameless villain Mr Joshua in deadly weapon. He just goes through the movements with his cardboard character here, edgy and zany as ever (with 'butthorn' his trademark being put down for the bad guys), but without the material to repair him. Henry Silva is present as a rogue villain, but he is completely here as an Arab leader (in a red beard!) And the horrible script gives him some very turbulent lines of dull dialogue that leaves his performance as good wood completion. He is just one of a host of action movie character actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who pop up but don't add anything to the mix. After a dull first half without much exciting action, pick up things at the end a bit, but it's too late, and none of them manage to be fun. *
