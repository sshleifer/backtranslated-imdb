The movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. Kill Kill, would have been nice. The movie contains taboo scenes to let the viewer move back into their chairs. The screens are unnecessary and untidy. The movie is something that a novice screenwriter could testify to. Just a waste of movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie if it's not 10 lines of my time, but I have to insist on telling people to avoid the nonsense. If people count on you to choose a good movie night movie, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth.
