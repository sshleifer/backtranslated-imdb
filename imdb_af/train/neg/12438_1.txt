Beat the bad guys ... Again, the marker line for this movie, it exposes so much truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home Alone one and two, movie classics. Home Alone three and four, a good movie if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as difficult as trying to be funny, it is not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He's a very dull actor with mere performances, but it's not quite his fault, the writing has prompted dull vocabulary and mere expressions. The pranks are only copied from the first two with different crooks, and you have to be blind to think the chicken pox is actually. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher showing this movie on a rainy day. And to make the worst, a completely different role, see if you don't believe me, but you'll regret it.
