It is interesting to see what form Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond arrived at the scene. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick, who works on leading ghetto kids on "trust courses". He romances a woman, who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s named Eric. The woman's drunk ex-husband soon comes to the scene and starts Pierce plowing. <br /> <br /> At one stage, Pierce makes innocent 'vegeburgers'. The man enters. Pierce resumed making burglars. The man then attacks Pierce. Small pieces of half eaten Vegeburger call fall from Pierce's mouth. The battle suddenly ends without showing the result. It's as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
