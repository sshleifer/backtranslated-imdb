The subject is definitely compelling: A group of people make their love of playing one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princesses and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that escapes our collective need to escape reality and sometimes the virginity of ours. The characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough to make most people look. But very quickly, the film becomes an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumb of the nose for viewers who don't get it. The filmmakers seem to be the subject of wargaming, and this one blows too seriously rather than once in a while and acknowledges the humor and pleasure of making a film about adults who get busy in medieval gear and foam sword pump. It's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7-10 hours or play games or discover the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even take care of it. However, the filmmakers themselves do not seem to choose to focus only on the subject of the game itself, rather than building a strong story with a clear story that anyone can understand. In addition, the characters themselves are not so compelling and you get bored of them quickly: a great no if you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
