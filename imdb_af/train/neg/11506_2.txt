This movie story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I can't understand much if they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there was some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and could do whatever she wanted, why did she fall in love with that bad man. 2. How can the story-writing be so weak? She was so rich, she could do whatever she wanted, but dared not divorce her husband that was very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I love you mean nothing in this movie.
