Sarah Silverman is really the "taste of the month" competition. Is she really worth the whole hype? Yes and no. She is sometimes funny, sometimes hilarious so (her behavior is actually very interesting, but not always funny). Other times, the media feels cheated to overheat another artist. She is one of the really cute comedians with whom men are especially busy and say they dig her intelligence and white. But if you make them angry, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, so they look at her. She reminds me why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them are popular now. Sarah doesn't drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she must be hot when she is 60, so her fans (especially the men) can be happy. <br /> <br /> As far as this show is concerned, it's a lot like her comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. If this is not the case, it is full of bleeding and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It is consistently funny and has a very good satire in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's hilarious to see him in a Tab T-shirt. But they never quite agree with it, and it finally welcomes you. Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another man) apparently tackled and do nothing for the show as a whole, and supporting players (including Sarah's real life sister, Laura, who doesn't look like her) is good. When the jokes hit, they were brilliant. When they do not, they are terrible, and I mean very terrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which today replaced real white and intelligence in comedy. So should you watch this show? If you love Sarah, go for it. You can look at her and pretend she is yours. Regarding her show, it ranges from good to absolutely zero.
