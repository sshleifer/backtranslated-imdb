I quoted Oedpius Rex as it is a tragedy that this film was even made. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I am by no means an Your Boll Hater like most humorous people on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Your Boll movies like Post- and Tunnelratte are hilarious and therefore entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that I would give it a zero star rating if I could. The story is just crap! It spends four-fifths of the film building the plot and then they kill the middle that just scenes of grizzly terribly tasteless! It eventually ends up with a "villa win ending" which is perfectly acceptable, but it can certainly be more tasteful than that! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) and I'm also not against violent movies! I love violent movies! I loved the Saw movies, the Hostel movies, the Tokyo Gore Police, the New York Ripper, the 28 movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, the Last House on the left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpah, even Kannibal f ** king-holocaust! But this one! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and distorted! And look at the movies I just listed! If I kept Cannibal Holocaust and not that, then it must be bad! Yours, don't get dark again! You're funny when you are light-hearted, just like Ed Wood. It was just a terrible experience! I felt frightened after seeing it! <br /> <br /> DO NOT KNOW! Avoid at all costs !!!!!
