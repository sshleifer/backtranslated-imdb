"The Matrix" was an exciting summer blockbreaker that was visually fantastic, but also thought strangely enough in its 'Twilight Zone' ish way. The general rule applies here - and this successor doesn't match his predecessor. Worse than that, don't even compare it to it. <br /> <br /> "Reloaded" explodes in the most unprofessional way on the screen. In the opening few seconds, the first impression is a generally good one, as Trinity was shot in a dream. Immediately afterwards, the film nose-dive. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually becomes momentum as they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it already loses speed when it reaches the 14-minute car-chase sequence and gets even worse at the end of the gratifying run. Worst of all is the lioness "Zion Rave" scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The bullet point aspect of "The Matrix" was a good addition, but In '' Reload '' they used too much to make it look boring. In the first one there were interesting plot twists, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically just a series of attractive deviations that prevent us from realizing how empty it really is. It works on the wrong principle that is better. It appears that "The Matrix" franchise has fallen rapidly in the special effects caused by the so-called urgent burnout, which has other franchises such as the Star Wars saga. <br /> <br /> The acting standard is poor for the most part. Of course, the best character goes to Hugo Weaving's "Agent Smith" - the only one slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definite Neo, but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of the impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss's share as the action chick, could be done better by any other actress. <br /> <br /> A poor, thrown movie, "The Matrix Reloaded" is a disappointment. Those who did not have the first one will probably not succeed. This one is for the hard-fans only. Even in the movie's own sub-genre of special effect bonuses (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.), it's pretty pretty poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5 / 10.
