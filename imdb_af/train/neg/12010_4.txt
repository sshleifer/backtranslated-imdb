The acronym "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film portrays the building of a "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which is used as an "air station" for transatlantic aircraft flights. Based on a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel; This was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne repond plus" (1933), and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste) and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) find love and sabotage on and off. the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl aimed. Mr. Veidt is the most fun to watch; but he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with me. Esmond and Mr. Fenton not. The younger co-stars were respectively the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak. Both the concept and film are not well-aged. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
