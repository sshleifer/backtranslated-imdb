THE CHOKE (aka AX in the United Kingdom) is a slasher that is supposedly produced as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say "suppose" because the title of the movie does not have the "V" in brackets to indicate that it has made a DVD movie (although it has the appearance of one). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple ?? A group holds a concert in a former meat pack factory and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most will agree that the movie will never be a masterpiece, but it does apologize for the mistakes. here. Even straight-to-DVD movies like BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which have a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming features and sometimes come off as one of the so-called "bad ones, they're good" movies. However, the CHOKE is far from a serious victim (such as HALLOWEEN) or a "so bad it is good" movie (like the NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie, however, starts off with a character murdered with a drill. The blood effects were very chaotic, but understandably given the very low budget. But from there it is completely downhill. <br /> <br /> There are so many flaws in the throat that I can spend all day. But, some obvious people stand out and I go into them. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned gig that holds the group seems to start with about 50 people present, but after the music stops, it seems to be just about 8 people left (and yet they are all meant to be locked up) to be!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not nice at all. Most of the members of the group are aggressive foul mouths or just plain strange. No one really cares about what is happening to them, and even their alleged friends forget about them when they are sent. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who looks like the meat pack factory as a kind of church (serious!). He injects some very funny lines for no apparent reason. But unfortunately, even his presence cannot save the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes that move around and talk without any characterization. About 65 minutes of the movie is spent talking about characters. Characters disappear for long periods without explanation. Like in other straight-to-DVD movies like CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time on each other aggressively without any provocation. There are many over-the-top outbursts (mainly male characters) and one leads to a full blown battle. In fact, the format can be said to go as follows: characters walk around - murder takes place - characters walk around - murder takes place. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and there seems to be few lines spoken without the f word being used. Maybe it was meant to be funny, but it just got so sad. And more to the point, we've all seen it a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The movie is completely without tension. The bodies serve as the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac runs loose and yet the characters work just like the total morons. They make little effort to get out of the factory or find a weapon they can protect themselves. And much of the time, they didn't even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same bait as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the murderer is not seen when the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears from nowhere to kill the victim in question. No one saw the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE it was thought to make the movie funny (unconsciously natural), but here it is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> And as another reviewer pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who love punk rock. The extras seem uncomfortable to dance to. The score (in the end there is no music at the beginning!) Consists of a group of Sugarbabe wannabes who sing a very bad song that is totally unrelated to the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand the points. made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classic ones (like HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th). But the throat seems to have been trying too hard to fit into one of those categories without adapts. And even if straight-to-DVD movies go, it's a bad effort. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the movie contains pretty good mischievous murder scenes. But when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly, as the intensity they offer disappears in oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of the traditional 1980's B-movie slashers have to take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classic like HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th must do everything in their power to avoid it!
