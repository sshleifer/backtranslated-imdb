Oh, dear sir. They changed what was an enchanting movie in a swinging testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of goats? We're not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he led his whole life to make it disappear. It shows you in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself disappears. He just lives to be free, and doesn't mean sick to anyone. We saw several times when there were accidents that he stopped making sure the other driver was okay before he left, even the police who were driving him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his quest, he took his life rather than being arrested and living a life of imprisonment. He died as he lived, wide open. <br /> <br /> In the remake, Kowalski has a whole history (including a first name even.) He tries to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from complications her pregnancy. He is a dedicated man and excited expectant father. He came to the decision to take his life after his wife killed his wife, but they even quit IT when they suggested he jumped out of the car before running into the bulldozers. They even gave part of "super soul", the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a chance.
