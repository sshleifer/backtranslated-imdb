I watched the Unknown version of this movie and realized about 30 minutes that I would never get my time again. I persisted until the end of the hope that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would eventually seem realistic, the special FX would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I'm a complete gore dog. I call some of the eighties splashes under the borders of the film world. However, it was not made in the eighties. If this movie came out in the early eighties, the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad. It wasn't that it didn't have the defense. The dialogue is horrible with so many bad lines that I wincing on writing rather than mumbling at torture. I don't like Hostel, I never thought it was overestimated, overheated and I didn't feel anything for the protagonist, but it seems like a beacon for greatness alongside this garbage. The back of the cover for Live Feed promises a twist you'll never see, I'm still waiting for the turn to be promised.
