This movie is really wack. There is really nothing nice I can say about it, except the moral truth expressed in the climax of the film about people in the neighborhood who participate in the fight against crime. In addition, the film had nothing: no good shots, no good acting, and no good writing. I give this movie a F and a 2 out of 10.
