I saw some pretty bad movies, and that's right there. No plot to talk about, it's like one of the bad coma episodes on a soap opera. I just wanted to hit that girl because she was actually suspicious of the movie. The monsters that ran around were funny. I also saw a little "Silent Hill" there. And I read that it was done by, or a Finnish metal band, Lordi, stared. So it's no wonder it doesn't make much sense. It seems to be a vehicle to promote that band and nothing more. The FX is very good, the look of the movie, the monsters, and even the acting is good too. But the story and telling it just isn't there.
