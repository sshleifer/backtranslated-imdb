If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to see it and I couldn't make it from start to finish. I can't believe the multiple stars given by others and can only accept that they know the actors or are publicized in disguise! The play is horrible everywhere, the writing is blue, the child playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress playing Amber's mother is laughing. I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas. Believe me NOW speak so! Neither of her emotions was really in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
