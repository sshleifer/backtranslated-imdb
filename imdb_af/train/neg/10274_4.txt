In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a festival. Meanwhile, they call the American nightmare pirate radio fun and confess their inner fears. A serial killer who listens to their confession makes their nightmares where they kill each one in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a strange low-budget movie that has a terrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman killed two couples in a secluded campsite, as if it was 13th on Friday. Then move the story to a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this moment on, the story has great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, which also shows some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of C production. The end of the script, however, gives no explanation for the deadly instincts and motives for nurse Jane Toppan's behavior, giving the feeling that the budget had ended before the finalization of the shooting. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good low budget treasure trove. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
