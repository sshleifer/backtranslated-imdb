If you're a fan of really bad movies, and you think it's funny, you'll be the big play of Shaq. First, the movie players are hardly ever working. Shaq had to be the worst actor I've ever seen next to Dennis Rodman who also made some bad movies. Well, anyway, this movie is also bad because of the boring child. I would give it a zero, but it is impossible.
