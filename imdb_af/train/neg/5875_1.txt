This film deals with two former soccer players who are Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of women and men with bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works to have sexual conversations over the phone. Jennifer is threatened by one caller who wants to do her terrible things and asks for help with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or hangout in a Sports Bar where all kinds of urban things are going on. There are many pushes, murders and many double meaning words that bring this movie to a great NEWS. Don't waste your time, this movie costs me just 50 cents and that was too much.
