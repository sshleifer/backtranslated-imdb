First, it's not as close as bad to some of the other garbage that the Sci-Fi channel produced; It's not that Grendel is a good movie, it's really bad, but it certainly has the potential to be much better. The film's flaws come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, visual effects, music, and for the most part: the play. <br /> <br /> Of course, when I talk about character design, the way we look at heroes and villains. Beowulf and the other Dene look like ridiculous Vikings, rather than brute force warriors - the helmet wearing our main character is just too stupid. Grendel looks like the Hulk, but with strange tentacles on its elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from start to finish, but Finn - a useless sidekick - has achieved two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also gets an idea if he gets less arrogant. <br /> <br /> Much like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it yourself, while still staying with the source material. The crossbow gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast didn't go off the set. In addition to additions, there are omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived, and as such they are on display less than credible. <br /> <br /> The music is overpowering, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not Sci-Fi's worst movie so far. No. It's actually one of the better movies, even though it's as dirty, it's a good rubbish, and at best makes it a guilty pleasure. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still here and there. <br /> <br /> I recommend you hit this movie and watch Robert Zemeckis take the old story of Beowulf, just because this movie (Grendel) is just half the story, not the whole thing this movie a three-star review.
