If you enjoy movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; Avoid this movie waste at all costs. It is an unpleasant, moderate, incessant waste of resources that should never be discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the past 18 months; annoyingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of his runtime. If it was much longer, I would not be able to write this review without using a curse. Consider yourself warned!
