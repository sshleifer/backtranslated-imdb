This movie is self-supporting litter. Watch this movie if you just want to hear the Scroll or enjoy the enjoyable soundtrack. Look for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It must be charming, but it's not - it's just annoying. The characters are hard to care for and the acting is poor. The stories in the film are also charm and sinister. I expected a heart-warming family movie, but it didn't have my fourteen-year-old daughter either. It's rarely that I can't see a movie to its conclusion, but one has both of us better. <br /> <br /> Although the film is in the present time, it made the appearance of a cheap Eastern European film during the Cold War. There is not even enough to leave a beautiful Scottish landscape and cinematography free. A real shame because it is embarrassing for Scotland as a movie.
