Haunted Boat sells itself as 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways, it is accurate. There are frightening and strange people around you. <br /> <br /> But the acting ability is at best poor. It shows clear signs that it's just a lot of friends making a horror movie. What in all credit granting them to the best of their ability. If you accept the low budget, it makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts almost like men wearing rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the movie are creepy and strange. But it suffers from the use of too many twists and turns in a short time that just leaves you bored and confused. To keep you awake, the movie makes it very good. Ignore the irrelevant turn every 5 seconds near the end, you really want to know what's going on. And are prepared to wait the 1 hour 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> It's not a Ghost Ship, but it will definitely be for an evening before the T.V.
