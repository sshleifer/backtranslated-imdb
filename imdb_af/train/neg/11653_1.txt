The first one was different and funny. This effort should never have left the studio. This movie doesn't make you laugh. It is a poor effort to perform brutal humor. The movie pulls out current and old movies to rip. This time the jokes seem to use and redo. The audience I saw just resumed after Hannibal's dinner and was otherwise asleep.
