Once again, a movie classic has undoubtedly been restored with predictable disastrous results. The title is fake, like everything about this movie. The period is not convincingly delivered, and the lead seems too young and too foolish to be even criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, point of view and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist, it would be another unnecessary movie. The 1967 version deviated from the facts, presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967, and it had some excellent performances that allow you to care. This 1992 remake seems to be known from the original movie, rather than the truth, and the actors in this version are called up, unattractive, and not least, interesting. Anyway, save this one and hope the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
