The spectacular romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship between a blind hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly beneficial in this highly-infected arrangement) The writing is small but not without a few thorough passages; Still, the scenario is such a middle-aged clich√© by the time most of the picture comes down to puerile. It may have worked much better with different benefits: Holden and Lenz don't fit well (her stature is so small that it looks like her tower), so their intimate scenes are less than uncomfortable. Dated, vague-romantic, and mostly inevitable. ** of ****
