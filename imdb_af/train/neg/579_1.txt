Listen to the director's comment confirming what I suspected while watching the movie: this is a movie made by a man who wants to play when making a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that teenagers cheated on going through it. I can write a book / script / award winning sitcom phase. There is a glow of an interesting idea being buried there (probably because it is a sequel to someone else's movie), but it is completely buried under an underwritten, poorly executed and laughable unthinkable writing. <br /> <br /> The lines are bad, and the performances are unimportant, but again, I tend to blame the director. He did not seem to have consulted the actors whatsoever about what was needed, but rather picked the writing in their hands, pointed the camera to it and told them to continue with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these actors can free themselves (say what you like from musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in driving your boat and more than acceptable in the front man). <br /> <br /> As it stands, the cast has no chemistry whatsoever. A great opportunity to use the classic sex and vampire paternity is transmitted when he infects Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his bad fellow hunter, he gets a transfusion. She had to bite him. Remember, they also had to be vaguely interested in each other in the rest of the film. The only true moment of sexual tension, between the two females, is by the directors own admission. He originally intended to use this silent order as an excuse for more senseless plot explanation - so, I suppose the final product would probably be worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> First, like movies, it's badly written, stupid and forgotten. Even if trashy movies are going it is not sexy enough or gory enough to entertain. It could have been a fun and bloody little skirt, but the director left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons.
