Buck's role as The Kahn brings Bob Barker into consideration (from The Price is right) to manage a country the same way he performs his performance. But there is much more to visit in this turkey and cut through. Kurt Thomas as the baby-facing "hero" shows some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a bit of acting talent whatsoever. There are a few Greek moments (in the village of Crazies, mostly), and some impressive martial arts ranges. But any given "Ninja" movie will give you much more entertainment, and you won't feel so guilty about laughing.
