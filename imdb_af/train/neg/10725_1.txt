As much as I don't like 'me too' in response to other comments - it's quite true that the first 30 minutes of this movie has nothing to do with the endless dirge that contains the next 90. <br /> <br /> To be banned somewhere does not make a movie lookable. Just because it doesn't look like a Hollywood product doesn't make it credible. <br /> <br /> Worse, in addition to no observable plot (unlike there are many muddy places in Russia and many, even very old women, drink lots of vodka), a number of visuals are so unnecessarily misleading that I'm involved with my second pack of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for spoilers - well, the movie is so without a narrative thread I couldn't write one if I tried. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money and don't be confused with a good Russian theater.
