Film industry is difficult business - because decisions must be made and everyone involved has a private life as well. This is the very original thesis of this poor attempt to make an 'insightful' film about film. And indeed, no better proof of the industry's activity than seeing Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell caught up in this foolishness. The insight consists of talking heads who like a studio movie who pay a lot or should I make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self? "Do the last, please." Or: "Our relationship is not just professional, it's also private. It's a fairly complex situation to deal with, isn't it?" "Yes, that is, my dear." Between the incessant dialogues you get a glimpse of palm trees, hotel lobbies and American movie posters (no sign of non-American film presence on the Croisette). Recurring slumber sessions are inevitable, which makes the 100 minutes of the movie feel like age. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing to justify her own presence in the framework.
