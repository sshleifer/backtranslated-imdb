it must be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the fan in 1991, it looks good. Since then I have always wanted to see it, but never found it .... Until today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> Let's just say I was so disappointed that it was unreal. OK, I knew it wasn't an Oscar winner, but still hoping it would be a fun fun. no-brain film in the blood sport form. Unfortunately it wasn't, it's Pooh. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about all American rock and roll music and acting, it was quite scary. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were rubbish and looked like. <br /> <br /> This DVD costs me just £ 5 and I believe I'm overloaded with £ 7. <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I'll never get that hour and " half back.
