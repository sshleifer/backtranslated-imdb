I saw the movie as a kid when it was released in the theater and it was so bad it became a family joke. If the position has a zero, this movie will get it. The dinosaurs were terrible. The storyline was ridiculous. The acting really doesn't qualify as acting. The only reason I remember the name of the movie so well is because my family is still talking about how BAD really was.
