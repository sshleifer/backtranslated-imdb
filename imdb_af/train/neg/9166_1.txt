Search is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say every movie has a point of sale, a gimmick. Transformers 'gimmick is the wonderful effects as well as the boys' nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattle's gimmick is situational in their tag line, "What if someone you've never met, someone you've never seen, someone you never knew, the only one was for you?" Many romances are strongly influenced by these gimmicks and some by big names. Spring years both use Irish folklore as the circumstances and with many well-known names in the country. <br /> <br /> So now that the theater is in the theater, besides all the common elements of characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, debauchery and denial, they also look forward to stimulating dialogue, resulting in more absorbing situations of the leap years, interesting subplots and possibly to some extent a good turn in the middle or at the end of the story that benefits the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> That's what Jean Yeo is not trying to achieve. If they tried, their goal was apparently in the other court, at the other stadium, on the other side of the planet. She and her author, Alain Layrac, have given absolutely no stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines are confronted. They seem to have a bag with lines that she would like to use in her movie: "Okay, these are the lines and quotes I've heard or read from movies I've seen or books I've read before and "They sound good to me. If they sound good to me, it will sound good to the audience. All I have to do is put them all together. I'm going to use them all." I can't say the lines were unnecessary and had no connection with the story or the plot, but they seem to be out of nowhere, with these quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who are quoting quotes based on most of the situations in our dialogue and trying to make them meaningful to themselves while they nod. I'm no longer going out with them, because the urge to hit them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the characters depicted are stupid and one-dimensional. With the exception of the unnatural dialogue that implies their motivation (needed to manage the plot), there was no conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. They are all simpleton spraying lines from the advice column of a female-oriented magazine. <br /> <br /> The clumsy in leap years is not enough to drive the story, because the circumstances are too shallow. Then again, there are movies with less, but better done than that, not there. They made it up with my first and second point. In addition, the sub-graphs are indifferent (not that it is a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass the horrific plot with fine places and acceptable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to obtain the approval of some viewers than the other with the good use of film, soundtrack and filming. These non-distinctive viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that's so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Don't look at this.
