I loved Dewaere in Serie Noir. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Okay, these are some guys who are flaunting convention in the most absurd and irreparable ways; many people find such behavior amusing. It was a boring, useless exercise designed to shock. I get the face on Blier's face, the face behind the camera, irritating. Serie Noir was a valid expression of personal freedom and debauchery. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere performing in the desolate fights, we get an idea of ​​the amazingly beautiful anti-hero we're going to spend the next few hours. When we see him chase the unfortunate middle-aged woman with his girlfriend Depardieu in Going Places, we have an honest warning that two hours spent with these hoods will be soul-clean. I struggle to even obey a "3" for this annoying distraction.
