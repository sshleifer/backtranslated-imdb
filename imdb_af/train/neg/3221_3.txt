I watched it on the tube last night. The actor concerned first caught my attention. The first scenes were attention getters. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the latter third of the film diverged. If it wasn't for the early part of the movie, I would have stopped watching. I kept looking at how I wanted to tie it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel it never happened. I especially did not have the expansion period that speaks several of the character Yiddish (?). Was it the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend it? No, I don't think so. Like other reviewers, much of the snake is dated (60's jive), but it wasn't too distracting. The end completely turned me off.
