The film seems unsuitable and overall, poorly written. The script moves as if 10 different people wrote it, and none of them communicated with each other. Apparently they wanted to take a page of a Miracle on the 34th Street (the original) type movie, but it did so that the movie fell apart. This movie is just for the very young, and even they will see the fact that everyone who wrote it knows little about baseball. Like: <br /> <br /> ?? When the Angels are in the last place, the owner doesn't seem to care, and is he not bothered by the fact that his driver just came with his pitcher in the fight? On the mountain? or that he has placed the team's play through a live television presenter. However, when the team is one game to win the division, he gets a story (over a 6-year-old) that the driver gets help from a child who sees actual angels. What sounds worse? A lost violent out of control driver whose team lost 15 in a row? Or a winning coach on the edge of the playoffs who act a little eccentric and help foster children? The owner's response doesn't make sense. And he is impressed by Maggie and her 'straight out clich√© land' speech at a news conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The Angels are supposed to play for the Division in the final weekend series against the White Sox, but at the end of the match the announcer still keeps the Angels winning a pennant. "The pennant is not decided until someone wins the LEAGUE championship. Not the regular season title. <br /> <br /> ??? Whitt Bass, the goofball jug is the starter and wins the game that the Angels lose ? And then the starting jug - THE VERY NEXT DAY. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is said to have thrown 156 places in low-score games in the ninth innings. Typically in low-score games the pitch is much lower than it is usually about 80-90 places. "AL" says the angel at the end "Championships should be won on their own", even though he and his angels are busy manipulate and fix games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I can go on and off as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10), this movie can be entertained. It's done too badly, it could have been a classic. an unforgettable mess that will live forever as a UHF / cable Saturday Morning washout.
