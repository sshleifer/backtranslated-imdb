Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there was a good thing - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half - it was simply not a fascinating movie. The victory between the comedy part and the tragedy part was uncomfortable or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting role in the two halves differs; I thought about the way things were explained in the opening scene that the people around Melinda would be the same people, responding differently (more of a "He said, She said" premise). However, we have two completely different stories and two completely different women. Both are played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two playwrights in the opening scene - the comedian and the tragedies - presumably take the same approach and go from there, but the two stories are only related. They do little to support the topic of discussion, namely that almost anything can be considered comedy or tragedy. Thrown beautiful, but a disappointing movie.
