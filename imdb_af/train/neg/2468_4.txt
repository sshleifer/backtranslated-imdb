It wasn't that good. Not terrible or hateful or anything, just forgotten. <br /> <br /> It had some kind of, reluctant, diluted air, as it never knew properly whether it was going to be laughing or sweet or satire. So we left with a weak mix of the three. The actors seemed to have been lost. <br /> <br /> The ideas were also very tired and recycled, they almost combined themselves. How many times do we have to tell the 50's in the states with a banal sense of consensus? And that it continued through aggressive consumerism? And that emotional oppression in men is a baaaad thing? Old hat. <br /> <br /> However, the biggest crime in my eyes was how detached from reality it was. I know it was a comedy and everything, but especially in a full movie where you have to keep an audience's interest for a long time. You still need some kind of emotional anchor, some related guides through the story, to encourage it. For the 'hero's' to look at an old woman, two fellow schoolchildren and eventually his father die painfully in the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet everything with a cheerful smile and a shoulder of the shoulders. struggles to handle it in any positive way. The mother was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhumane at that level, you run the risk of losing me and that happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive thing I can offer is that I like the look of that kind of apple pie suburbia and it caught it well, it was an attractive film, especially from the wide corners of the street and in the Robinsons house. Also, the opening news rule was cute, in a former but rather funny kind of way. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and it comes from someone who isn't a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had this fear that he would hang it up and try to steal every scene, but he played it very well for him and probably got the most sympathetic character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good.
