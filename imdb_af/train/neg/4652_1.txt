It was a painful example of an inexpensive, boring and inexhaustible show made by Australian TV stations to fulfill local content quotas. The writing was really awful and I am not surprised that the authors are responsible for those responsible for the worst Australian film in the recent memory of the Honerable Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing about this TV series was funny - never even generously amused. It was just tired and BAD and worst of all, it really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to look. <br /> <br /> Something very suss about this show is given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) overview through a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there wasn't much) and that's impossible. Or crazy. There are bread rolls that are nicer than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and if it comes to DVD, remember that the laughter earned is unintentional.
