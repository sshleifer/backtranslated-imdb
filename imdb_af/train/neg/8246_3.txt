Daddy's girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some wonderful news at the local post office, unaware that they have been plagued by burglar Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, father David Miles is receiving a message (from young Robert Harron) that necessitates daddy going home; So, when the young women come back, can they be ?? only at home. While the vulnerable couple is calming down for the evening, the local "Grand Ball of the Black and Tans" is underway; And a dark-skinned drinker adds additional danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his better biographical roles, stealing the movie "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced extras at the Black and Tans ball. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West are suggestive of later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and they are overly loving in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, as the story of a burglar being saved by saving his potential victims of a greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** The girls and dad (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
