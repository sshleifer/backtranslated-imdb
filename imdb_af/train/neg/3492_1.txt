I don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. I buy them for battle scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fighting scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but moved too slowly for my taste. There were mediocre scenes throughout 3 or 4, lasting only a few minutes. The last battle was a bit longer, but I was so bored that I didn't even pay attention to it.
