This effort was like a glittering TV movie ... I don't remember ever having it released in the theaters. If so, it must have died quickly. To watch the DVD, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was clear that this movie was not meant much more. Ed Lauter is an art critic with a greedy streak? What a fun turn that should have been ... I haven't seen Ed since "The longest site" ... Everyone else has done pretty much the numbers, led by Baldwin, except for Pompeo ... She has had no charisma. and looks like it's sleeping through most of the photo ... Pompeo's daughter had one dimension ... she played every scene like a lovely puppy ... slowest line-up of any 3 years I've seen. .. <br /> <br /> The hunting scenes have given my wife and I headaches ... too much quick cuts and corner bashing ... If you're going to shoot a chase in Barcelona, ​​you might want some WIDE shots to use the beauty of your wallpaper, right? The whole story was pretty impeccable and far-fetched, but hey, we looked for it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
