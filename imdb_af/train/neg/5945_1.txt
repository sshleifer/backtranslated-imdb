A black man fights ..... and presumably wins .... yes ... 1/10. Of course, fiction. <br /> <br /> So, we are presented with a damm-nice title, a very good tagline and even a nice plot line. It's about it, that's where it ends. We move to fiction after that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, the black guy is not confused by the name .. depicts a black man. Umm, that's all there is. <br /> <It's so hard to find decent help, the black guys have hired friends to help keep the low budget, low inefficiency of this movie, the camera's shadow behind the first scenes ... Yes, obviously idiotic moment for the average guy like you and me .. but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. review submitted. if you paid to watch this movie, you screwed.
