I just watched it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I love, has. I was definitely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The notion that convicted prisoners would fight to death for TV ratings was overhauled with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner, and the new movie, Death Race, which will surely suck me because it stars Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> It was just a drill for the most part. The "Kill Bike" action was ridiculous. The "training" was a snooze festival. It never grabbed me and made me care for anyone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the other ones mentioned and you'll be better off.
