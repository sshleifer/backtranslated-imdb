Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so awful that I had to see it, and I can smell it in St Louis. Where do I start? National Lampoons tried to follow Animal House's success 5 years later, but they missed the point completely. I'm going chronologically with these short movies. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently he didn't work back, so the boys of National Lampoons probably called and said, "Hey, we're making a c ** ppy movie, would it be?" Peter was like "well, I don't do much of these days, why not?" He was a great side character in Animal House, but he couldn't wear this sorry short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The point of departure is funny enough, with Jason Cooper (Riegert) telling his wife to leave him, she must find herself. It's too strange that they are actually in a happy marriage. So he chases her off, she goes, and Cooper is in charge of the kids. This, of course, leads to the burning of the home, the loss of some of the children and sleeping with a variety of New York bimbos (including an equally young Diane Lane). Then the woman returns, wants the children, and the film ends with a coin that will determine the fate of the children. The idea was pretty clever, but the director stank. The characters all seem as if they are falling asleep, they must be baptized. Sorry, Boon, your legacy is decorated with this flop. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Give Dominique Corsaire. Pretty girl, recently finished college, not sure what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, starts to sleep with a few mega-rich guys, takes their money when they die, and she doesn't stop until she has the most powerful man in the world. Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of the United States). Again, it could have been funny, and although I was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to shed everything, her actions were terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can't believe I've made it that far. Here is the firefighter Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinking he can really help people, even though he gets cynical after being shot several thousand times. Nagurski, really, just gave up. He looks at mosquitoes, attacks, calls them, and never enters. He claims the world is lawless and he will probably be tried if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the taxi's run) enters the action, appeals to the police, commits a crime, but has his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again it could have been funny, the representations were deliberately champion, but goodness, no energy whatsoever. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their names on this shock. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was subtracted as well as the rescue effort in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I were part of this movie, I'd like to remove my name, it's terrible. Then again. That's why I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr John did the movie score (repeatedly to the movie) and the movie isn't much longer than an hour and a half. Show this one in movie classes with the heading "you never have to do in movie recordings." This script had to be left on the shelf because yep, it's so bad.
