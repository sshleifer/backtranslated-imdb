John Wayne and Albert Dekker are competing for oil rights on Indian territory, and the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic. Pictures of the photo shot from Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting Western kind due to its characters and its more modern environment, with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis, who writes with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell focuses on the work-friendly way his career fits. A possible everyday story is indeed saved by his last third, where gratefully picks up the action and we are treated to something like a wrist. The light approach to the romantic beach is not right, and a glorious fist fight between the two main players is ruined by Rogell not disguising the stuntmen doing the job. But hey, stunt men always deserve their glory. Sturdy support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual, has lots of screen charism, especially if he rattles his gun. But in spite of its better than regular Republican budget, it remains only a film of interest to 1940-Wayne enthusiasts. 10/04
