This movie has a lot of Broadway feel - the background, the play, the 'noise' - and yet it is all it has. Some 'sense' of a Broadway without the bang. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, the picture becomes incompatible, the song appears on you so you are suddenly reminded that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Inconsiderate: Sinatra's fiance --- sure, the pitch and emphasis of her voice were unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Portable: Mr. "I remember the numbers on my dice". <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando's distinguished song (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how many Jean Simmons look like Vivien Leigh in her Havana scenes. This is the bone structure! How I would have killed Miss Leigh in a role, Brando again challenged.
