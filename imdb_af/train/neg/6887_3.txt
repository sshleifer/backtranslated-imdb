Another "boy who doesn't grow up" flick, and just the other recent ones like entries. In another bad wig, which Napoleon channels for what, the third time? Anna Faris is as always forgetful; Jeff Daniels calls one of at least another state; and Diane Keaton ... how is it tested late in a career? Don't bother. Nothing is said here that has not been repeated many times. I'll say it; it is about a hundred times better than "failure to start". There are very few amusing pieces in the movie unless you think Eli Wallach's curse is funny. Ha, Ha! He is old and he has dropped the f-bomb! Tea, hee, hey. Lamentable!
