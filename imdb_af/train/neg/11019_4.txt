Fred Olen Ray is a bad director, even up to B film directors, but 'Haunting Fear' is probably one of his better films. Yes, it makes butcher the great Poe story 'Premature Burial' and yes, it is poor and uneven throughout, but it is also quite entertaining. Queen Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a beautiful, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) plans to leave her because he needs to pay a gunman (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early 90's soft-core films, actually gives the best performance in the movie as a playful mistress. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as Doctor and Michael Berryman, in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes. The end didn't make much sense!
