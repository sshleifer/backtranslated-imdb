This rubbish excuse for television is the single most divine piece of garbage that ever touches Australian television. The housemates are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously foolish and chosen on the basis that you will probably try to kill them if you have to live with them. As far as I am concerned, Big Brother is the decline of Western society and shows how we, as a society, are on a steep slope to become brain-dead. Whatever happens to television that did not target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? It cannot be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who once was a respected comedian and, after moving to Channel 10, became extremely unfriendly. With the exception of The Simpsons being made highly intelligent.
