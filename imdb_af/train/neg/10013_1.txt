An elaborate plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn plot of an outsider on the inside that eventually ends. <br /> <br /> With such an outstanding case, one would think the movie would be above its hardened origins. But scene to scene drones with no change in intensity, no character bows, and inexplicable behavior. <br /> <br /> The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary - or on the other hand completely unexplored. It just seems to be included to stimulate the viewers. When will Hollywood learn that gay characters do not automatically make a more compelling picture? <br /> <br /> An amazingly horrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected her and Kristin Scott Thomas better. This one is definitely one to miss.
