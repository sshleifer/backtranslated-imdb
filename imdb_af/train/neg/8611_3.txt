When Rodney Dangerfield is in a role, he is hilarious. In My 5 Women he is not on a role. The timing of the one-liners is down, but they are the best thing for the movie. The five women playing the women do not add more than one whole actress among them. The plot is very poor. Even the premise is pretty poor; There are a few jokes to have more women, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the movies can play the same way, even though Rodney's character only had one wife. So the performance looks more like an old man's fantasy as an important part of the comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we must assume that Rodney's character is an athletic skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be calling his role just to make a friend a favor, and the rest of the actors simply have to be desperate for work. <br /> <br /> The strange nod to political correctness later in the movie doesn't really matter to the movie. For those who politically correct their movies, non-PC humor is still in the first place, and the apparent excuses about it still do not get the point. For those who hate to see a movie hole for political correctness, the PC inserts are just annoying deviations. <br /> <br /> It should be the mildest R-rated movie I've ever seen. There are some furious jokes, and the bedroom screens would have made shocking TV 40 years ago, but that's about it. Maybe it was the topless men (joke). <br /> <br /> The DVD contains interviews where the role-players look at the depth and interest of this film and their roles. I wondered if they were serious or joking. They look serious, but I thought, "They must be sheep!" There is also a peculiar disclaimer which suggests that since the movie never calls the Mormons or the Church of the Last Day Saints, it is somehow not about them. Remember that the movie has a polygamous religion in Utah, and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Women was a disappointment. I was looking for Rodney on a role, but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney looks good for a man who hit 80.
