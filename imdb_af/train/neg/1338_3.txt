I saw the goals. Twice .... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins making the same movie .... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with boys. OK about the movie ... first of all the little boys and girls do not play on such big goals ... 2. football does not play out in time ... 3. whether the game is over, give the referee overtime (a minute or more) ... and the finish is so provided. I think this movie is bad because of the lack of soccer understanding .... if it is done by European producers, it will be better. and also the men actors are not the right choice ... they suffer from a lack of authentic. OK they have played in full house for a few seasons, but they don't make them big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what is missing in the Olsen twins
