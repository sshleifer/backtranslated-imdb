I can't tell you how angry I was after seeing this movie. The characters are not the least interesting, and the plot is non-existent. So, after we waited to see how the lives of these characters influenced each other, hoping that for the last 2 and a half hours, a significant finish had come, what did we get? A storm of frogs. Well, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but in the first place it was presented with absolutely no resolution. Secondly, it will be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible, part of the population or Charles Fort (an even larger portion). As a somewhat well-educated person, I thought this movie was a self-indulgent arm imitating a signal field episode. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. It would be better spent reading ... <br /> <br /> ... anything to be honest
