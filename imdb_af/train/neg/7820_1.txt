or: This is a bird? It's a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: No need to look up in the air. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If singer tried to make a romantic titanic movie to defeat the box office, he failed. The SR structure can't do that, the dark and limited color scheme (I call it "wishi-washi"), the boring ordinary dialogues, the clown with advanced alien technology, the missing fun and magic, etc. Completely disappointing the movie. <br /> <br /> It simply doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The main thing about a character like superman is that he is a superhero. This is the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love problems and an unfortunate depression. Super softness can only be a facet in a 2:40-long Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> Because then it's no longer a superman or superhero movie. It's like a (and in this case, a very bad and boring) social study, where a person flies around every 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us oversight, super activity and the most important thing, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We WANT BUSINESS! Singer, if you want to make a 2:40 long soul, should you have a difficult drama about lost and sad people? Then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then supersadlysoft is in the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe singer tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but one bad movie can't. Don't give up, they plan a sequel ... <br /> <br /> Next time singer (and Warner Brothers), make a superhero movie, not a depressing superlamp soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically there are all kinds of things, yes, there are many small conversations, there are some jokes, action screens, etc. But the only one who has all these worse things in common is their poor quality. <br /> <br /> It's no more than a super-boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous cast strategy (throwing them young as possible, so we can follow up in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, she looks like 19. Superman was full for five years, so he slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16 (looks like 13) and a daily planet reporter , cruel "I spend a night with a superman". Warner Brothers, this is too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not that bad, he plays a little wood, but the whole movie is wood, so ...?! Temporary goods were marches and sometimes posey. The rest, forget it. Even spacious, this is not its terrain. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder was so fun with fun. What a difference. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Jesus is ridiculous. What should hell be? The problem here is, it means serious, not a joke. Next time, Spiderman or Batman or Ironman fall and rise like Jesus or angels? Or they speak directly to God. Why not ? They are superheroes who save human lives every day. That is why at least one conversation with God must be possible every week. Oh my God. Perhaps it was not the right announced movie, but it is of a bizarre, dull parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the warner brothers, this superlative depressive movie may be the greatest disaster in history. Not just because of the money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it was to create and transport a few messages or feelings, but being alone, lost and sad is not new to people and thousands of movies or TV shows did it better, in very old or new like magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than the flying superman, sorry, superman of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, it's just nothing. In fact, it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for (comic / superhero) movies and steals our three hours of life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's little brother. (Very angry and green like the Hulk.)
