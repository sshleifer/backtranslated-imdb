I found this movie to be an interesting study of cause and effect, but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberately and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The performance of the film is very promising, but I feel it fails to deliver on its promise. Too much time is spent telling the audience about the chaos theory and too little time to actually show it. As a result, I never had a real feeling for any of the characters and I never had a good relationship with them. By the end of the movie I had a "so" attitude about everyone. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but as it stands, it's just like that
