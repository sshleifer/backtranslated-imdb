Vulpine massacre had to be this movie's real title. And the tag line must have read "Guaranteed to make your kids CRY!" It is a natural drama that tells the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Begin with the encounter and mating of two young dragons and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials to raise them. The only talk is told in a narrative by a tree standing over the pit, giving insight into the animals that love and live ... Beautiful scenery and beautiful filming of the animals. Sounds good, huh? From there, things go straight to hell and then start drilling to the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - or they may be a warning! <br /> <br /> Almost the first time we learn that one of the foxes was born. But it seems good enough to get together and there is a beautiful cheerful musical score to accompany him ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the brothers and sisters adventures. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets her screen time ... and then she dies ... And so it goes like a terrifying shooter movie as one fox after the other is killed by nature, in traps, just on and disappear, and even through a lot of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie, almost all the dragons were killed. Although merciful, no deaths are shown on the screen. (At least not in the version we saw.) Unlike saying "Tarka the Otter", death in this movie is almost all useless and adjoins the sadistic way in which hope is built up and then scattered. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It's a natural movie, though. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie that is being deceived by the joyful box to think it's safe for the kids. Look at it with some knowledge that things are not going well and that you or your children can be left very much depending on how sensitive you or they are. You may enjoy it. Or you may not ...
