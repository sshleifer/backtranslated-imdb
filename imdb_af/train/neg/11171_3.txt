A lot of a movie from the times - extremely long rows without dialogue, bad flashbacks and an almost completely masculine role. The two women who appear have a total of less than 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. <br /> <br /> O'Toole sounds when he speaks; Unfortunately, he spends a lot of his time by scrubbing. Alastair Sims is always a joy to watch, but he is also terribly underutilized. <br /> <br /> The film has one additional positive aspect, depicting many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathy (such as the coincidence of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too much of today's World War II films paint the Allies as everything good and the ashes as all-evil, when history tells us people are much more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> It'll be a great movie for when you recover the flu and are bundled on the couch and can't take anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while stabilizing your electrolytes, it's the movie for you.
