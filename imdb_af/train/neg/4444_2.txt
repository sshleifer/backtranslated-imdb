Dr. K (David H Hickey) has tried to master a formula that will end all diseases and disabilities, but must provide donors to complete his work. His doctor's brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is accepted into the medical school.

Eddie is accidentally hit by a car and appears on the death of death when dr. K make a proposal to Richard. Let him use Eddie to recover his secret, illegal methods. When dr. K applies, his serum to Eddie's terrible results. Eddie's face bends massive warts while also gaining a taste for human flesh. Many will die so Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite that he can't quench. Soon he could even pose a threat to his father and girl. This sample must be stopped. <br /> <br /> Typically, terrible direct-to-video horror movie suffers from a serious lack of budget, acting and overall talent. The prospect, which looks like an interesting horror festival, fails to deliver even as a zombie movie. The gore is limited with a few munching scenes, but most of the violence takes place outside the camera. Using time to move the story together can really get annoying.
