I really despised this movie when I saw it about 6 or 7, because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. So far. This full trash has robbed Robin for a long time. I recently recovered with his funny but serious part in Father's Day, but then he made a mistake again, Bicenntinial Man, I think it's called, but the point is. Robin now has to get much better work and now he has returned to perform the clever who came up with these 'classic'.
