I didn't think the French could make a bad movie, but I was clear, very wrong. As mentioned earlier, this film uses its title character as the point of departure; The portrayal of her life and person has little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The writing is terrible - pretentious, stilted and vapid - and the rewriting of the facts is extremely offensive, even in a genre that too often makes its life by distorting rather than telling . . Along with a fairly decent set design, Valentina Cervi's physical charm is the primary asset of this movie, and it goes without saying that filmmakers were aware of it. they do not waste time creating different "erotic" rows that are much more related to titration than plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of the view of a beautiful young girl in a state of sexual upheaval, and not, can support this film. The acting is imperceptible, and the score is too generic despite an interesting chord or two. The cinematography is OK, and there are some nice colors, but there are also some funny sequences that use distorted lens effects that are more suitable for a freakout movie of the 1960s as a costume drama. In any case, the writing leaves the camera house too often on Artemisia's body, and too rarely on her paintings. <br /> <br /> All told, almost complete failure. It's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as softcore pornography. So the French can fail!
