Not the best actor movies. The director concentrated on the actor's projection, rather than giving a good entertainer. Can be the hero himself, his family and his sincere supporters can enjoy it. But it's certainly not worth a neutral audience. The battle order is a total comedy. The dance movements in the song series are pathetic. The music is average. This film was the biggest flop for the actor. Unfortunately, despite the hype created over the movie, the movie failed. Don't even look at this move, even if you want to kill time. You can watch a cartoon instead. A good film buffer cannot digest this shit for 2 1/2 hours.
