The first noticeable problem with this awkward movie is its decisive. Ann Nelson plays the grandmother here. Three years later, she would star in 'airplane!' as the woman hanging herself while listening to Robert Hagays pine for Julie Hagerty. I couldn't get that image out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is a fifteen year old with trouble. He has a headache. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a massive heart attack. A chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going to this family. First, she hypnotized Ouma Nelson. Nelson tells a flashback story that fills the entire first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and Oupa bought a RV, cheap, and drove it to all the tourist falls in the desert of California. The RV soon has a thought of its own, going off the road and so. Then big rocks start to move on. The elderly couple are scared, but stay in the vehicle to move the plot along. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the RV roof when going for another unplanned ride. <br /> <br /> Boston's mother starts talking to some native American mummies she's in the house. She plans herself as a writer and makes great notes on the sleek bodies. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses her imagination to fill in the spaces. We see the mother half-jump, but her mental breakdown takes place, like Gramps's heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, the patient's resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own story. He believes the mother is wedging (it was made in 1977). Obviously, ma makes the astral bodies of indigenous American mummies fly through the air. One hits Mat like a bite strikes a windshield, and Matt starts all the crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt in the desert. Matt is now inexplicably in a wheelchair and the trio confront the invisible (and inexplicable) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of theater construction. The one pro here involves the RV stranded in a salt flat in the desert. In the distance, the couple saw a few rocks moving to the RV. It is a beautiful, spectacular little scene that is eventually overplayed. As the rocks begin to move to the vehicle, the special effects become obvious. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the RV runs off the highway then take up forever. The screens where grandfather is trapped on the RV roof while looking on a gravel road, last forever. Mom's conversations with the mummy take forever. Matt's body reform lasts forever. This movie lasts forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to hit the fast forward button at least a dozen times. As scenes dragged on, it was obvious Flocker was padding. Cut the fat here and it would have been clocking for an hour. The final "explanation" of the mummy's spirits trying to kill those near Matt never holds water. Did they stay the RV? The filmmaker never makes the fact that the spirits are not good in their murderous ways, they never kill anyone. <br /> <br /> As I thought of Nelson in "Airplane", I also thought of other movies. Anything to let me fall asleep. Boston is horrible as a child and is playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten-year-old who has a smart alecky line for all those adults who fall over themselves. <br /> <br /> In the end, Flocker wrote and made a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise to make the audience sick. It's not scary, and like the ghosts, you can still walk ... away from this band at the video store. <br /> <br /> It is unclassified and contains physical violence and light curse.
