I saw this movie at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel today, after seeing rave reviews, but I think the critics just struggle after Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) present at the festival. It's definitely the slowest movie I've ever seen with many useless, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides the Defoe who was decent, the play of the two and a half other people in the movie, Defoe's wife, Giada, was ridiculously horrible (how they throw the part of the shop at the bakery is outside me). This movie is more or less plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and out of the wall. The only scene that touched any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and doesn't come from anywhere as if it were just a kind of shock value to the dull this movie is. Sorry this is so hard, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worth the time of filmmakers.
