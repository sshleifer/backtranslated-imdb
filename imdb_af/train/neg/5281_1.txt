The humor in Who's Your Daddy is such a bad taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Often it's not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so coarse and hide their nervousness, they laugh. To see who is your father gave me a disgusting nerve feeling.
