It's not a bad movie. The plot (new house next door seems to be ghost) is not bad, the mood is scant enough, and the play is good. The big problem I had was that I was familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (of Twin Peaks and other programs). I couldn't figure out how different she looks with her seemingly new, big lips. I kept looking at them. They look so extreme on her face! They make her look completely different (and not better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor Kim plays the architect who designs and throws his heart and soul in the house, does a good job. And Lara (as Kol) is also very good (but those lips!) As the owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriate wood. The different characters living in the house were also good. I especially like Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to enter the house. The attempt to engage us in the overall neighborhood atmosphere fails, unfortunately, as the other neighbors are not very similar. <br /> <br /> For some reason the director couldn't make the "haunted house" particularly ominous. Other movies (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) get that ghostly feel, but it doesn't happen here. The closest is when Col is painting the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that didn't work for me is the plot turn that takes place at Kim, the architect. Initially, it looks like he is a victim of the house like the other (it sucked him out of inspiration), but later he seems to have been in the evil with it. <br /> <br /> Overall, not bad movie for horror fans if you can get your eyes out of the big lips!
