A very bad successor. Part 1 had very funny moments - part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and made natural to express money from the fans. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only slightly amusing moment in the film is Helge Schneider who apparently appears over the other characters. It is pretty easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is sloppy / non-existent. The director must all do a favor and immediately leave his job. The acting is worse than a 2nd grade school game. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is terrible too, but who can blame the movie / sound guys who had to work with such an undisputed director?
