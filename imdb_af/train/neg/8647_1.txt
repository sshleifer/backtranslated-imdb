Amateur in the extreme. Camera works especially overwhelmed - documentary camera operators don't have to turn around all the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really relentless, and the acting is even worse. In addition, the story is untouched and tortuous - with some gaping holes in logic. At one point, the head wants to be jailed to suppress shoulders with suspected Al-Quada operations, and get an interview with Osama. I found the story absolutely incredible because of so many mistakes. The "filmmaker" / lead role depicts a rash, idiot frat boy. The only item of interest is really that the filmmakers actually had film in place. It's really a shame that they have wasted their opportunity to make something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this crap?
