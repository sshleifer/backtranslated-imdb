What a piece of junk this movie was. The starting point was okay, but even in the beginning with a huge effect of mixing in giants with normal size people (even the effects in Hercules were better). I knew it would be bad. But the very terrible part of the movie is the dialogue. It's totally incoherent, stupid and stupid. I felt it was written by the 9th grade in the creative class and got a D-. I want to clap Casper van Diem and the other actors to go through this movie. <br /> <br /> I had my share of casey and bad movies (I love the tremor series), but ... I don't recommend it. It's stupid and the totally flabbergasting bad dialogues will shrink you.
