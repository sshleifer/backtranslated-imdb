I just finished a marathon of this series, and it made me painful to see how it progressed. From the fictionalization of the historical elements, to O'Herlihy's horrible accent in later episodes, the show just falls the further it goes. If you are looking for low quality production normalized WW2 fluff, then I can recommend season 1, but avoid anything afterwards, it degenerates as one step out of a soap opera, with increasingly worse story lines and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The old B&W movie is by far the best of any entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it, and even that is not what one can hope for.
