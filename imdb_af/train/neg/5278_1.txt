When a comedy film boasts its amazing soundtrack on the back cover, you know you're not playing with a top movie. I rented this movie with friends who expect them to get chuckles, but overall to make the most of us laugh, make the movie enjoyable. We couldn't have picked a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been good with some changes. First, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly executed and placed. The fat kid in the movie killed us, blessed him for the scene and scene, but he was like a puppy thanking for love. If he was pulled out of the movie, everything was possibly portable. There were some funny jokes, I believe one was when the group of boys stole one of the parent's porn movies and it seems to be gay porn. But to summarize the comedy best, I will just tell the opening stop for the fat child. He wears a colored shirt and talks about not knowing when something was done. <br /> <br /> To end, the movie editor can have saved the movie by removing the fat child, 20 minutes from school screens and an end longer than thirty seconds of random bickering. <br /> <br /> OH, VAT, there are two good elements that the movie owns. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and does his jokes so no one is missed or undervalued. The other redeeming element of the movie is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored most of the shameful movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, even this one rental. This didn't address me and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
