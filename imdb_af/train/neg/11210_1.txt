I read John Everingham's story years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember remembering what a wonderful movie it would do. And it would probably have been if Michael Landon never got his hands on it. As far as I am concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license was completely over, similar to his small-book booklet series of the Little House, a proof. The play, for lack of a better word, is frightening, the screenplay messy, and there are more close-ups of Landon's puzzle than should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This movie reflects Everingham's story as much as Little House on the Prairie "reflects the books are" based "based, just another vehicle to show Landon's horrible hair.
