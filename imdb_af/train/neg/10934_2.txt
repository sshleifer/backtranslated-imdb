First of all, let me say that I am an LDS, or rather, I am a Mormon. When I watched this movie, I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. I can usually redeem something in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. It does have its redeeming moments. But they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that was very worried about me was that it seems as if Halstorm was shy of our church! In the LDS Church, congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". NO ABOUT one of these two names. The church is never called by the name and the "standards" are as far as what our church believes. <br /> <br /> Do I wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This film had so much potential! This would have allowed our church to be seen in a positive light and to help the public not only see what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was merely entertaining and left a lot to be desired. If I wasn't already LDS, I'd be left. Mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a movie I would recommend to my nonLDS friends. <br /> Pity Halestorm. You can do better than that!
