I went to see this film with low expectations, but hope to be charmed by watching my hometown on film. Unfortunately, it's about everything I have. The story covers familiar territory (high school reunion), but the plot is complicated and supernatural element adds little to this well-used theme. Although the quality of the play was good, the content of the movie was frightening. The sexism of the film was blatant - women are apparently unfinished unless they are married, reproduced, or both (although placed as a post-feminist choice). Worse still, racism - the shrill Jewish mother, the black man still living at home - and free cruelty (pain in the classroom). We must be ashamed if these characters presumably represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the authors should be murdered by displaying such broad and brutal stereotypes.
