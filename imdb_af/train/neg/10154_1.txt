How can this movie have a 5.5? This movie was a piece of skunk s ** t. First, the actors were really bad, I mean car saw Charlie was so slow. because in the beginning when he put his head in the log cabin (it was about a quarter of an inch thick (it was really cheap like a faint piece of wood) and he didn't even think he could throw it. the person who did the set sucks as * to deliver what they can build with. The only good thing about this movie is the idea of ​​this tv show bottom line Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this boost because they call a movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
