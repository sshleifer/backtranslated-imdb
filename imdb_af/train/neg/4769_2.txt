Unfortunately, it was wrong. This movie stopped from beginning to end. It was hard to watch, because I have Clarissa explaining it all to Nickelodeon every day. I loved her. Then the next thing I found she had had a spread in Maxim and she was beautiful! I didn't hear from her until I accidentally watched this movie. I couldn't believe she would even show something like this with her name about it. Everything about it was wrong, but it still seems as if someone somewhere in the team is trying very hard to save a sunken ship. Too bad .. I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real movie in a real movie.
