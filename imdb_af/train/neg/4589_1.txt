Remember the chain smoke channeliser exposed to 60 minutes a few years ago? It's her. Many people reviewed this movie without watching the bona fides of the film people. The producers used very successful promotion of mouth-to-mouth promotions without revealing the financial and philosophical foundation for this piece of marketing. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age and day-old baloney, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you will give her a lot of money. If you can go through the Ramtha website without crying in disbelief, then you might think the money you dropped on this infomercial, because the madness was well spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
