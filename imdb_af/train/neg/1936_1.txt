Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make her look like she's been drinking. But just before she was killed, his sister's business partner (Teri Garr) told the phone that she hadn't drunk within 4 days. Yet the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! And the characters talk about her drunk when she falls down the stairs. Huh? Really bad mistake in this movie, which is very awful. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, considering the big role. Some mistakes: the writing is not very good, the music is made for TV, and there is no tension, because we know the answer to the riddle from the first scene in the movie.
