The monster of the Enemy Mine somehow made its way to a small mountain community where it lived. He is being hunted by a female doctor-turned vigilante who erases him. This female assassin, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, is riding a motorcycle and is trying to save a bunch of kids who have chosen a Big Chill weekend in the midst of the monster's peat to hit. Decapitations and lots of blood are mainly in place to get the attention away from the story that is like a bad version of the island Dr Moreau (and yes, it's worse than the one with Val Kilmer).
