I wanted this movie. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and Spenny Rice has a nice side for him. Not that I like to have fun. Spenny ruins this movie. He has to stick out of Kenny and his hot friend. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's pretty boring from a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really aren't too many celebrities in this movie, and most don't look more than one rule. Overall, this movie is disappointing. I would just suggest looking at it with the season 1 DVD of spenny (it comes free on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to watch The Papel Chase.
