A small village is being attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lonely revenge vengeance and a group of ragtag survivors. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" got something from a cult after the release. It's easy to see why - it's loaded (and I mean mean loaded) with gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, as found in other non-budget cult grubbles like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback "is actually contagious. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's not enough to save it. The movie was shot on a Super 8, so the image is gritty and dark, which makes things very difficult to see (it would have been great if the protagonists had obscured the terrible mullet.) Grid is also the soundtrack, which Annoying Casio exists. Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what is it with this no budget horror flicks and bad Death Metal?) While not expecting Oscar-worthy performances, the play is still strictly amateur, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of scared or threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of non-budget feasts will love it. Everyone else would want a little more meat on the ribs.
