This movie tries to be very clever, and Tarantino like <br /> <br /> before you try it, you need solid cinematic principles. This includes good sound, editing, set design, etc. <br /> <br /> Talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely scary. I've never been distracted by a soundtrack, and even before we talk about low budget, film made in Chile, etc. We must keep in mind that the mind that the sound these days is much more feasible than it ever was. everywhere. and more information about technique is available than ever before <br /> <br /> the sound in this movie is simply bad. The foley is particularly inappropriate and inappropriate. The atmosphere is equally terrible. I heard at least four loud pressures during the movie, due to poor sound editing. The noise in cars is terrible, the sound of the car's doors is terrible. the sound of the lady is wrong. Foley is either overboard, or simply not there, as the sound person just got bored and gave up. the spaces are wrong. everything is wrong <br /> <br /> and yet, not to limit the creativity, at the same time, the movie is trying bravely to be smart. For example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene. We hear sound when we are not supposed to. audio changes in advance visual cuts. Every trick in the book is used, but the foundations are just not there. <br /> <br /> edit-wise, we have scenes with heavy jumping cuts, we sank around with the timeline etc, yawn. All these techniques are followed to a wonderfully low standard <br /> <br /> overall the mix is ​​crap, the sound is crap. And so, the movie is a crap. how can a movie with so many fundamental errors be considered for awards and high praise? Chile's cinematic new wave? The best creative output that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I don't think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's more selective and better talent has avoided this movie, like the plague, perhaps because of its risqué content. Likewise, the film has probably received so much unjustified critical award from so-called "world cinema" enthusiasts for the same rogue reasons. they will probably flame in the trashiness. Of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This movie is junk. It's all mouth and no pants and never earns a 6.8 score. the movie has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porn!
