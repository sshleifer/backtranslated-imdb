Outspoken gay niggers are a short foreign film about black, gay strangers exploring the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth. Being gay is their goal to have a masculine only universe in which all people are gay. Therefore, when they experience women or "female beings" on earth, they are scared first. finally, they decided to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male populations. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist story, though probably meant as a satire, gives this movie a shocking value. However, there is little dust at the bottom. As another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes along the names of the characters (eg ArmInAss); I think I once laughed at a little gay joke. I think I quickly got the point of the movie, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had enough; I did want the movie to end (and it's a short movie!). Not written brilliantly or exceptionally well.
