Seriously. This is one of the stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot- A family without a mother and 3 "fathers" increases 3 daughters in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Neat freak Danny, cartoon lovers Joey, her obsession Jesse, spoils Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost ordinary Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters or not? <br /> <br /> So I don't think anyone should look at this show. I just ran a few moments in the show and I think that instead of lethal injection all criminals must be forced to see this show, a torture that is worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 of: D
