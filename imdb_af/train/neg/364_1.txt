Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same man who made "Attack of the Lord of the Brains" and two (counting them: TWO) conspiracy films about Marilyn Monroe. He must blame this. <br /> <br /> On its ever-expanding stack of remains left over from Oliver Stone's "eh-I-grow-out-of-it" conspiracy file, here's "Down On Us, it's the working definition of historical inaccuracy" <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar, cuz, that's the Real Deal! Yes, the three big names in the 60's were killed by government because they were subversive or counter-productive to the truth, justice and the American way, or just like that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look honest like them real life damage (that is, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths the good old SU comes from a well on them! Yes, that's the truth! <br /> <br /> Man, I can't believe I've watched this movie, it's facts, when it's not credibility to breakpoint , is ridiculous; the play makes TV ads like high drama, and if you watch it honestly, you deserve the "turn" end. You really do; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But as the man said, "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> Not this movie. <br /> <br /> No stars for "Down on Us". And that's the film that describes the film, incidentally.
