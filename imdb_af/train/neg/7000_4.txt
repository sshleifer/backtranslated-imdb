Hollywood, the home of hype, brilliance and the search for profits, is barely regulated by spiritual values. It is therefore no surprise that his efforts to conduct spiritual life investigations are thin and often stupid (better to go further - to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, for exploring the portrayal of the spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the many insights it tries to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to meet Verne (Clark Gable in his most hectic and self-righteous way) and July (Joan Crawford, who puts every other word in an effort to become the Queen of Tough Ladies and spit) ridiculously at best. Is it the patron saint of the Star system at work, which matches the fighting egos before sending them to further criminal justice on the M-G-M lot? BUT. . There are good supporting performances here, and visual arrest of moments: the shadow prison barracks; the escaping boat by moonlight or against a picturesque cloud; July walks along the beach as the wind whips; July and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate for Verne's freedom as the storm builds; an unusual fiancee-gay jail relationship between two prisoners. . . Above all, there is Paul Lukas's dignified and detached performance as Hessler, a killer who can appreciate Cambreau's virtues, but he turns his back on him. In the film's most arresting moment, after leaving Cambreau, Hessler stood outside the cabin. We hear the wind passing through the jungle, see the shadows on his face, carrying a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he goes out at night. In this moment, Hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth and existential power that cannot reach any of the other characters. Is the film's secret that its deepest sympathy with Hessler is associated?
