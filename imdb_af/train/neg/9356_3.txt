Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It's pretty poor as well as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance tracks, she sings only two songs (WHO and ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the spritely title tune, has been devastated, although we can hear the latter in the background score. Miller looks overweight and amateur here - no star quality. Even her dance is cloutish. The film is very poorly written, stocked with boring and indifferent jokes and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as an artist, look at it all, but for general entertainment, stay away.
