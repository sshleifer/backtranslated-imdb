What can I say? I'm a secret fan of 'about the top' action and horror movies. Especially when it comes with lots of humor and innuendo, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three potential moves to this movie: ?? The comedy of the situation; ?? The horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes from an airplane. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not written as a tongue-in-the-thumb horror or comedy, and there is only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you will smile for yourself. If you want to feel the movie, the trailer represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you expect a movie full of action and shocks, you won't be disappointed. . It doesn't stand above other movies, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, Though the novelty of Snakes of a Fly does not bear, but you will be thinking of the theater "what was all the hassle over?" <br /> movie has a high rating but it does not add up. A) Many reviews where written before the film was released, and B) User rating breakdown has much less variation than normally 77% of people rating 10/10, with only 7% of people giving it 9 / 10 - Why such a huge gap?
