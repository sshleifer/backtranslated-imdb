Last night I watched this movie on DVD and decided to watch the reviews this morning. I, the robot, seem to have polarized the critical display community here on IMDb (and also gave rise to many insults and call-calling). <br /> <br /> I find it somewhat surprising, as this movie is not big (or even good), but it's not terrible (or even really bad). What this movie really is ... is depressed. Depression that the American movie-goer population is so ready to get indifferent, clingy rejuvenation and welcome them as spectacular new works. This film, written as 'straight' everywhere, from the plot line (an uncomfortable mix of Asimov and contemporary uber reaction) to Smith's character (a slender cynic with a spine titanium), to the special effects (which are borrowed from Matrix and a few others). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "I, Robot" is probably the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, unceasingly snappy dialogue, and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew (it looks like Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has a lot of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn on this movie are critical enough to notice. Perhaps a surprise by today's standards, but many B-films compared to true winners.
