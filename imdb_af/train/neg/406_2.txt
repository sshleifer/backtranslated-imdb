The buzz for this movie has always been about the fabulous graphics that Kevin Bacon disappears. Unfortunately, they stopped there.

You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements specific to an invisible male film (IR glasses, spray with something like paint) was poorly handled. <br /> <br /> What is sad is that there were many possibilities to make it a fascinating movie. The psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, the treatment of an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been much more interesting. If there was any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. All in all it hit. <br /> <br /> I mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the end of the movie, but I don't want to spoil. It's enough to say that these characters are so stupid, they don't think about accessing a machine rather than ...
