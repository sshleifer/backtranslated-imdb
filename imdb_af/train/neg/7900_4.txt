The title creatures are devastating in a peaceful little desert village. It's basically the whole plot for this movie, and while the screens are devoted to the Munchies, it's a little fun (in a lower kind of way), the rest is just filler and bad filler. From the "hero" who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe to the ultra-dumb town cop, it's hard to choose the most annoying character in the movie. There were a couple of times when almost everyone was on the screen and I thought, "OK, the girlfriend is at least cute, but why should we raise the rest of those morons?". The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which were probably dated in the early 90s. (* 1/2)
