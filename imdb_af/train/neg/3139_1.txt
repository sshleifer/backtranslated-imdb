First, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and awards the movie won, but for me it's still an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary of the disaster, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a pussy-romantic conspiracy. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen for this, just shows in my mind the sad taste and common sense that film critics and audiences have nowadays. Who said that all movies should be a hero and a heroine? In fact, most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster was certainly not one. I feel it needs a better writing and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost thrown away in the last order where the 'dead' lovers meet each other among the other lost passengers and crew breaking out in applause. Is this an intelligent movie? Ask yourself.
