I didn't hope much when I saw it. However, after playing the JasonX with some friends, I got a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself went too serious. Do I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no. There are a lot of Ft13th movies that are covered anyway. By the end of the day, he is a walking killer, I'm not going to get it sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what, but unfortunately they were little and far between and at the end of the movie it turned into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch ... just not funny. <br /> <br />
