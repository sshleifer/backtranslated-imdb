Lynne Ramsey captures images, and Samantha Morton can evoke a gesture. So, wishing to discover their talents, wasted in this way, pretentious lion. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can't bring Callar to life. Her efforts are too artificial and oblique. Her camera repeatedly stares at long silent shots of the terrifying actress as if Morton's wiped look can only deliver character. We are in an empty Warholian hell of self-denial: for a movie that contains minutes to mock insects that crawl over the floor, you can think it can run around to escape its lead. But how will this be if she rarely speaks? Without the novel's interior monologue, the celluloid Morvern Callar is no one. Little wonder Ramsey often challenged Morton. <br /> <br /> It was said, the first ten minutes had been so impressive, shot and edited that my hope was up to date. Give the movie so much: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep any.
