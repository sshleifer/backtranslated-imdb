Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she is fifteen years old and her birthday is over a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to join her, but the couple who manage to mysteriously die her interest. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to see this movie is because Dana Kimmel on Friday 13th pt. 3 was there, which is not a good reason to chase and watch a movie. When I started to look at it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good treasure, it is really boring and sowing and just doesn't go. After more than an hour, only three murders took place and the story didn't really develop in any way. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully shot with pretty nice photos and directing, but just like with many other 80's slasher movie, the movie is sometimes too dark. The play is actually pretty good and Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even though she's a complete slut. <br /> <br /> The story line isn't quite rubbish, but it's just too boring for you, The only thing that interests me is Melissa, she was stunning and Dana Kimmel, who is really sweet and cute in this movie is. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice dull shooter that doesn't go, I definitely won't recommend it to Slasher fans.
