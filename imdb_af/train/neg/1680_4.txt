Even with a cast that boasts such widely trusted names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland does not boast a depth of the film. It hardly brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the moves, as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth both hopefully missed the other two roles; as Holmes's wife and minor girl, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it is impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film is also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a Paris Hilton cameo.
