If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, WWI history does not read World War II history. Find out what happened during the war, how soldiers had to be killed all day. How so many soldiers became insane, what they saw during WWI, when they called it "shocked", now calls it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the real horrors of World War II, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how one can be killed, not because they are evil, but simply because it was the only way to deal with them the abominations around them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie misses it, as many others do. Read some books on the subject and watch the movie "Paths of Glory", the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in the movie, the feeling of helplessness, and a complete devaluation of human life, as nothing more than the catchers. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie misses, it's really the key to Germany's understanding. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, for no real reason. Then comes a total economic collapse following the war. These are the factors that cause extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty will always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this movie has ignored these factors and has just thrown another to throw the hope. With really no real value, there are fiction movies based on fictional characters that can give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than it does. They just threw Hitler's name on it, so it would sell more.
