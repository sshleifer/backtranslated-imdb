A real horrible movie that made me feel, I watched the forty minutes or so, I could stand. Not the actors' fault, but the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc. need a very difficult talk. Maybe it thinks it's deep. It's not. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike the center of Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human understanding. There are also no stray dogs that I have seen. On the contrary, it feels like Pete Walker could turn his hand, and even with the fact that I'm probably a little unfair on Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a powerful human desire, but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this spicy effort. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's particularly misogynistic, but just too persistent in portraying certain details. The blood runs down to GA's leg pain rape. , example. It is not challenging or confrontational, although I am sure that the filmmakers "dare" themselves, just deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is it as high as we can strive? Is that why those who were involved wanted to make movies? (I'm writing here the Latin phrase that translated as Oh the Times! Oh, the uses! But the new game control on IMDb won't let me post until I remove it. Similarly, I had to remove square brackets. Sorted IMDb.) < br /> <br /> Where is the high aspiration? The noble impulse? Watching the British movie - the joyful comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on False Idol, Our Man in Havana or the Sublime The Third Man (a movie that has much more to say about evil than a thousand straight points); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, look at 'The Offense' Dir. Sidney Lumet, from an original play by John Hopkins. Look at "Tunes of Glory" for something worth making. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the foregoing, Straightheads is unfortunately a completely hateful waste of celluloid.
