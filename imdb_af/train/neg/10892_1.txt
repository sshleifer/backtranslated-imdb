This movie is AWFUL! I don't even know where to start, I'm speechless. I can't even describe how terrible it is. The blood is blooming first and the acting is AWFUL! The only good part was the biker chick who saved the day. This movie was reasonable, I don't see how it can even get a voice of 1, it's so bad. It seems to have been made by high school students.
