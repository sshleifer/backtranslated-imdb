OK, people, honestly ... this must be one of the worst movies about show biz ever made, but I slapped myself (this may be why I enjoy it). Basically it's about sex, sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a big problem in this movie? If you have a thing for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoilers !!! *** The funniest thing on the movie was the man who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and his wallet with his love's flash could flash photos. A triple A for bad taste and fun!
