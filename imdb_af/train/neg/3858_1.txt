What a terrible, horrible movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I usually like movies like this, the whole. A man meets an eccentric woman he likes, but he is already involved with someone who is not right for him. I expected something predictable and I didn't care. The movies are always entertaining to mix the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every single joke falls flat and the "romance" makes me want to vomit. The title character is one of the most "kill me" characters I have ever seen on my television, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, more like exaggerated and annoying. The "other person" is the most reasonable, mature person in this movie, but it is also just as annoying. These movies flat out of suck, there's no way of it, wasting your time.
