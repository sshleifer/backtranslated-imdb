Why watch this movie, if you have good movies to watch. It's a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad because I wanted to see it. Everything in this is BAD. Actors were bad. Scripture was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI ever. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the film in the comic strip. One interesting thing is that there is a characteristic that we wish he would die because he was so stupid that we were getting enough of him. (I don't remember the name, but was the BOYFRIEND of the "Chosen One".) <Br /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 stars out of 10
