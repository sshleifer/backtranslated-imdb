The point of departure is ridiculous, the characters incredible, the dialogue, and the end absurd. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but watch him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours, because an alleged Frenchman is not as amusing as it sounds . <br /> <For her, Meg Ryan is as beautiful and beautiful as a (take your choice): Kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think, is the cutest creature on earth. She also does not have the slightest resemblance to a real person. <br /> <br /> This movie strikes me as an occasion seized by friends Lawrence Kasdan and Kline on holiday in Paris and southern France while being well paid for It. So I can't really blame them.
