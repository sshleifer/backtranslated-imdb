The Danish movie Slim Slam Slum surprised me as the worst movie I saw until this date. I didn't think it was possible to bowl my bad bad b-list, but this one deserves the gold. It's not funny. It's bad, it's badly filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls in it. I believe this movie has the potential to beat the other Danish movie "Stjerner zonder brainer" as the worst Danish movie ever made! And it's really something. Congratulations!
