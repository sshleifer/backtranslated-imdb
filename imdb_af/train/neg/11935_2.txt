Billy Chung Siu Hung's (1993's Bloody Sword Assassin) film Love To Kill (Hong Kong, 1993) is one of the strongest products of the Category III tree that occupied the HK cinema in the early 1990s. It consisted of movies with strong sex, nudity and violence, more or less free and shocked. Love to kill, definitely belongs to the "more" category with some memorable ideas and pieces of celluloid disease. <br /> <br /> HK Psychologist Anthony Wong (of the award-winning The Untold Story by Herman Yau of the same year) plays a business man and a man who likes his young wife (Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung) torture, humiliate and rape who for some reason did not leave him and save her and her little son from the disturbed tormentor. A policeman (Danny Lee, the famous police character of films such as Dr Lamb (1992) by Billy Tang (and co-director of Lee) and The Killer (1989) by John Woo to name just a few) see the problem, however, and begins to protect the woman and the boy, but of course Anthony does not keep it at all and leads everything in the typical ultra-moderate, spiritual and graphic finals during a rainfall. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost completely without any serious merit, as it is just an exploitation to win cash when these types of movies were so popular. The images and events are something that is never found in the Western theater, at least in the mainstream, and it becomes even more buzzing when some of the most taboos for Westerners, such as violence and perversions by a child witnessed, these films are broken. often what the plot lists read alone, most viewers will feel sick, and it is also perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> The film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned Dr. Lamb who started almost the whole boom in 1992. Usually the music and soundtrack in HK movies is interesting and add to the images, especially in these terror films. Cinematography is also worth mentioning as the movie bath, especially in the final, in blue colors and camera lenses (like Assassin) and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera. Otherwise, nothing will determine the film at all higher than on the nastiness meter. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses are talented and professional and so the film doesn't get worse with their acting. Still, the film has the usual HK humor in it, which makes the sick even worse, as some humor is thrown into the soup. This includes jokes about Danny Lee's erection, and so on. Something that can never be found in Western "serious" films. And the thing usually destroys men's otherwise notable HK movies, as the humor is just as obvious and tries to entertain the audience and masses. <br /> <br /> The movie has a very high level of cruelty, as it has many scenes that differentiate Wong's wife. She is raped and molested, beaten and kicked by her husband. We also get some flashbacks from Wong's own childhood, which is apparently as violent as his own father also killed and his young boy changed into what he is now. These flash screens, mostly at the end of the movie, also include some unexpected experiences, as the images are speeded up (for example, the hits of an ax), creating a totally insane and temperate atmosphere on the scene. Another thing that just seems to be HK exploiters. The ending itself includes very sudden and shocking gore as the man carries his ax, and also some nails, for example, in his furious way. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film is really pretty "suspicious" in my opinion as violence and terror are realistically painful and dealing with things that should never be taken as entertainment, I usually mean rape. The version I saw (I have seen two versions) includes a very long and completely misleading rape scene that is just as sadly trying as possible. I'm not sure, the HK audience really likes images like this, but I don't think anyone with any kind of morality in movies / entertainment will ever accept or make anything. Women are broken and murdered in the most sadistic and low ways, so the fate of the men almost looks like women. <br /> <br /> The other version I saw, the new-born DVD in HK (without subtitles), has shaped this "table-style" scene into a much longer than the Taiwanese DVD subtitles otherwise identical to the HK version. I also heard that the old HK Laserdisc differs from these two and as the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the real movie, it is impossible to say how "uncut" versions are those that are released or shown is theater is. Clearly, many footage has been cut out, possibly even before the scene release. <br /> <br /> The film was written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin. The former also has films such as Dr. Lamb, The Untold Story and Gunmen (Kirk Wong, 1988), but from his other films I have seen, Love to Kill is the most free. Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story are both very brutal and violent, but also have some criticism of the authorities and men in general, such as how easy it is to change into an animal when they fight. The disturbing torture image of The Untold Story, the criminal who is the criminal, is very strong and certainly has its impact on changing something that can be rotten in society and under police. But there is nothing in love to kill, it is honest, calculated and exploited. At the same time, a veteran director, Kirk "Organized Crime & Triad Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993) <br /> <br /> Love to Kill doesn't earn me more than 2/10 because I Not too much appreciation for movies like this. (HK) Cinema is meant to be and can be more and movies such as Love to Kill are merely commercial parasites living among real-life works.
