Oh my God, it was so bad! The story was poor - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie takes itself too seriously ... unless of course it is meant to be funny. I saw it last week at the London Sci-Fi festival and the whole audience laughed at every scene. I think my favorite was "don't study medicine at Oops." And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could tie in the character of Nicalo's only line, "we'll be together ... that's our fate." I'm sorry, but after the first time the words lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what was the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend it as a lesson for Americans: You can't animate, so please try. You don't grant yourself.
