It would be a viewable Hollywood mediocre if it was a good edit. It relies on the typical American thriller plot - "what goes all apart". The act is below average but with a shiny appearance by the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises. Film is completely suffocated by empty video and audio shots and most look like raw film material. All in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student movie project, it's a movie to watch. I think it will be enough to say on this movie, everything can really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.
