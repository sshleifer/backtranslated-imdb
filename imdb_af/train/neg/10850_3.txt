This movie has some things right from the bat. Having Dani Filth as lead actor, some people automatically make this movie. Admittedly, I love Cradle or Filth and listen to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes a good lead. The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor. There are a few GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. For a low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways people died were very creative and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Now to the disadvantages. There is very little talk throughout this movie, and so very little in terms of character development. It is difficult to fear the life of limp, static characters. When there was a little talk, the F-bomb was full and popped up in random places. Yes, I understand people swear, but it seems a preteen boy wrote it and thought he was cool to include all the language. The storyline, which I could make out of it, was pretty good, though many parts remain and the lack of conversation makes one wonder what happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence, but like a porn trying to draw a storyline, it just doesn't work well . Rent it all, if you are a morbid person who wants to eat your blood and meat appetite.
