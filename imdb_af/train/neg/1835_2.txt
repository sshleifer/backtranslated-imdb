Start writing. I saw cartoons with more depth than "Envy". When characters continue to repeat what you've already seen and were not for the first time, a movie is in trouble, which is "Envy". A movie that relies on one joke is better to go with it somewhere. Here we have a movie that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken wants to forget this bomb in particular, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller is in some pretty good black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster", and "Duplex", immediately. Be sure "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just total nonsense. "Envy" deserves its low rating because it's stick, it's stink. - NOTE
