In the many movies I saw Warren Oates, I came to a definite conclusion, here is a talented individual. At first I have Mr. Oates returned in the 1960's television series, Stoney Burke. From then on I followed his career diligently and felt he was destined for great roles. It happened in 1974 when Sam Peckinpah gave him the best bill in a movie called "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia." Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his beautiful role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I've always thought he was able to bring some character a certain magic, until I saw him in this flop. The movie is called "Chandler", a tribute to the iron-refined detectives of the 1950s, created by Raymond Chandler. Because the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye, I was immediately interested. However, I patiently sat throughout the film and found that it was a boring, uninteresting, slow, custom, confused, confusing story that had to be a theme or plot, left in a dark back room itself. Along with and with Hollywood's best supporting stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this movie had enough power to reach Mach five. true. As a result, one of my favorite actors was trapped in a poorly crafted vehicle that never came off the ground. **
