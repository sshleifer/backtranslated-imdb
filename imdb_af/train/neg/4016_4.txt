There is a DVD in 2002 in the code HRGD002 published on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inner edge. <br /> <br /> There is not much point in producing an adult movie. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are credible. It was in the United States in normal theaters. <br /> <br /> I saw it in Pensylvannia, back in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such, it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no special features and no subtitles, and is probably made as a VHS band as a source
