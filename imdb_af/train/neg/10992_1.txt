The Underground Comedy Movie is probably the worst train wreck I have ever seen. Luckily I didn't pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to review it again with the fact that it was so terrible, but he had to show me how terrible it was. I love color comedy. At least I thought it would have it and I would be entertained. No, instead of the acting was so terrible, the "jokes" were extremely bare, and the plot was not true. Maybe it wasn't supposed to be a plot, so I can't hold it against this movie. It's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman beating her head with a bat through a bat ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform has a bat worn. Hilarious. Simple genius. I had the feeling of watching this movie that its creators made it and laughing hysterically with their friends. Maybe it was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand. Or maybe it's the worst piece ever made and it should be locked in a safe and immersed in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't Buy This Movie!
