When I first saw the preview for this movie, I really couldn't wait to see it. The plot was good and the environment was good. I mean, a slasher movie that takes place on prom night, good idea !! And the plot: A high school teacher who is sexually obsessed with one of his students gets crazy, is arrested, and escapes three years later on promnay! Prom night, a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable, gets into hell !! However, I saw it and was very disappointed. Not only was it the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it was one of the worst movies in general I've ever seen !! First, it wasn't even scary. There wasn't one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat. The murder tones were so cute and boring. All that the abuser has done has stabbed his victims several times in the stomach or cut their throat. Also there was absolutely no gore (she rated PG-13). The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the murderer killed the black girl. He cut her throat and blood splashed on the sheets hanging around them. (They don't actually show him how to cut her throat). <br /> <br /> Next, you'll see the killers the first time he launches in the movie. . He is not mysterious, creepy or scary. He is just this man who kills people. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie was so cliché. An example is when the killer eventually kills the main character and at the last moment the detective shoots him dead. Also, every thing in this movie was so predictable. The victim, after seeing the man with a knife, running for her life, hiding, thinking she was coming away, and then the killer was just poured out and killed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the order of the movie was very bad. The man goes to the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, somebody pulls the fire alarm, and everyone is evacuated. The main character forgets something in her room, meets with the killer, walks and escapes. That's it! She and her boyfriend go home, the gunsmith kills the guards who patrol the house, finds the girl, is then killed by the detective. The film series was so stupid and cliché. <br /> <br /> If you think to watch this movie, because the preview looks good, trust me, don't waste your time or money. No wonder this movie is shown in the smallest theater in the cinema. My friend and I, along with these two girls sitting on the back, were the only ones in the theater. It had to tell me beforehand about the movie.
