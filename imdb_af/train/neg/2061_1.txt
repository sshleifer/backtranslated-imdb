The only movie I've ever come across. Amazing, since I paid for myself and my date and I'm really cheap. But my brain could no longer be piled up from the drink, especially as I could have written a painting material while tied and clipped. <br /> <br /> From the start to the end, this film insulted. Worse, it's not funny. It wasn't funny, and it's not funny. But even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of a very clever, sophisticated comedy. It is youthful, really sophomoric script and ideas have started an era (to this day), where cheap laughter and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film. Sexual Olympic Games? Which high school kid didn't think? The beginning of the end.
