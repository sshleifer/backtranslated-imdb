This movie is not really terrible. Someone pointed out that Mo is the kind of Americans who snicker. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon Yahoo, who don't care for Frenchmen; and the Xavier character won't swing them. <br /> <br /> Let's look at his stereotypical features of the Frenchman: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Look. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, underhanded look, look, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation for the kitchen. Look. <br /> <br /> 4). Poor work ethic. Cheque. (Forget the fact that he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, to watch the movie, he seems to be doing ten hours of workshops.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful woman, look. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Solve interpretation of marriage vows. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). Great sexual ego, which says an American girl owes you sex when you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> Whether or not Mo is a heel, there is no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than writing the script. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other male judges, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen's cute little body. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for that.
