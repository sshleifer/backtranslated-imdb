I read reviews that you believe should have been in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand. Maybe it's true, if so, then this movie is out of date. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The end makes about as much sense as all the kids who are anti-government and anti-corporation without any better solution that society does to a Mad Max type sinking bat. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can leave, but they don't. The reasons why they are about this do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What a bunch of innocent people are up to is supposed to mean, never explained or even shown. It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have, and it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The characters who go on a killing boom are not fighting The institution, they just kill people. I thought they could have used all the explosives to blow the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, it would have made more symbolic sense, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> t1; Dr - This movie is an adolescent's daydream to fight against authority they are bothering, but in reality they need it. It has no moral, symbolic truth or meaning; This movie simply plays the fantasy of killing teachers and people in the "power" that annoys you. <br /> <br /> If you think a murder rampage / school shoot similar to columbine or Virginia technology is a rational and sensible way to handle teachers and settings you don't like, then I think you will find this movie love. If you are like me and you work to make a living for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie), which is uprising against the man, this movie is young and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also tell in parts that there was no funding, and the story has a hint of attention disruption. <br /> <br /> All in all, it looks like a very rough concept of what an okay movie, but no effort in dialogue, character development, or morality is, so it's just ... done badly. <br /> <br /> If ... I can just get my two hours back.
