You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell your life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when everything you really want to do is hit the fool and walk away? Well, I had a similar sensation while watching this movie. Well, I actually decided to watch Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste of making himself the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last installment from his memoirs, I wanted to make Moretti the madre of all blows. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a few other characters managed to get a word in edge ways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that everything you hear for an hour and a half is a highlight of how his politics are best, or what peculiar piece of popular culture is his fancy tickle on moment. He also finds time to finish movies he doesn't like, something I thought was for losers as I reserved. If you're in a position like her, you think he'll try to make a little more intelligent about the theater. By making a good movie, one with a few ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started fawking about his newborn baby, I just wanted to be in the company of someone who is normal, preferably not a self-obsessed movie director with a strange love for sticky music. The next time someone you don't know is trying to tell their life story a slap of me. Every battle will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
