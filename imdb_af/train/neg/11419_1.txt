I think I've seen this sort of thing before: college graduates don't realize they have been doing well, all the time, complaining that their lives are sucking. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly derived from The Big Chill and Reality Bite of what I can make of it: they have virtually the same plot. <br /> <br /> If something good came from this snoring festival, it was the music. That was it. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but then I never expected anything less. This movie is directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; Another movie that should only be seen with a blindfold in the tow. <br /> <br /> Now for the verdict: this is 1 out of 10.
