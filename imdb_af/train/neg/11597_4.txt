With the plot Alice, after surviving the previous installment of the Nightmare series, I found that Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams started again. This time, the rogue killer is hitting Alice's unborn child's sleeping place. His intention is to be in the real world again. The only one Freddy can stop is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? This movie started out very well when we see Alice dreaming that Amanda Kruger is stuck in the room and raped 100 manika when she is rushed to hospital, but then she is no longer the pregnant woman, but then she is Amanda again to Freddy's birth. . <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people to come back from the 4th movie and then get new friends. It wasn't long before Freddy killed again. I have the first death, not as good as the other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself did not feel fearless in this movie, but the nightmare was just boring, they were not scary or creepy at all. /> <br /> The movie was good for a 5th movie in the series, but overall I think this movie was really Dull. (Not yet the worst movie of the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
