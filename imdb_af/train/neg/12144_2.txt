Although nothing with Vampires Vs. can compare. Zombies ... In any movie maker I will try to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breathtaking. When there was an explosion on the television screen, I thought my whole house would explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells had landed on the floor on the floor. Simply surprised my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene when the Jack Black sound-a-like gives the worst monologue I've ever heard, I almost killed me, but don't worry because he has blown in The movie can he left his terrible play on "I must be tall". Seriously, he had to watch him unceasingly about non-congruent thoughts that made absolutely no sense and just added that he had to be "high" to justify his terrible scene. Well, if you can say that excuse horrible drama, then you'll probably get the same reaction ... seriously. If you spoke to the authors, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you would probably get the same answer. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Skok-o-rama" I was shocked. I didn't put a sawn shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this terrifying apology for a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you must be killed <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> The General
