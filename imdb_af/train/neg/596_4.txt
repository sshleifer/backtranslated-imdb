Basically, what we have here is little more than a remake of the spectacular 1970's classic kitsch horror 'Death Line' which was ironic, like the cobblers, also partially filmed at the unused Aldwych underground station. <br /> <br /> Good use of the Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross, as well as the aforementioned Aldwych, basically contains the same plot dodgy murder mad zombie in the tunnels that miss the lost passengers who missed the last train has. Originality is not this film's strong point. <br /> <br /> Indeed, strengths are unfortunately lacking. The gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessary malice, while the sub-Gollum nutter is never really fully explained, as it looks little more than an underdeveloped plot device. <br /> <br /> Franks Polente has little to do with a thin script as many tunnels run and scream every time. Indeed, she was like many others in this movie, retired by a puppy and a pack of easy rats. <br /> <br /> If creepy movies on the London Underground are your pocket, or you just want to "play the tube". They get it on DVD when it hits a bargain. If you're looking for classic horror, you'll need a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good and written movie, you need to change trains. .....
