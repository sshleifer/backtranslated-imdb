Actually, it's a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Didn't Bug's Life do that either? I think it's at Disneyworld in that tree, so I say before they go and use it as it's logo. Shrek 3d was also a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They still have to consider it as a movie, as it appears in a "theater" and you can buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, though the little flies. I like IK. I agree with animaster, they have done a good job of making a movie out of something that is just an out-and-back adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
