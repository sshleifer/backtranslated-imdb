First, this movie starts on a very dim note: a 10-year-old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides it's funny to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and then causes a terrible accident that kills the mother .... duh .... I'm sorry, there's no 10-year-old who's stupid. The rest of the movie doesn't get much better. After the death of the mother by the seemingly stupid 10-year-old on the planet, the father moves the family to Genoa, Italy, where he has to teach at a local university, but here is the vowel: he doesn't speak a word of Italian! Then the little girl has "visions" of mum (who she killed), and often subsequent night terror, which always ends by the father who loves her and coddling. Then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then find and then cuddle and then cry and lose and then have found (followed by, of course, more hug and cry) to the point that I actually demand some kind of natural disaster. these uncomfortable, ignorant people from the planet. Don't get me wrong, because I love India, but an indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is simply ridiculous and useless. It is really a pity that this movie was based on such indifferent characters who were in such delayed scenarios, because the room was interesting.
