A lot of promise and nothing more. An all-star cast is definitely by HK standards, but man o man is this one stinker. No story? It's good, the action will be like most HK action flashes. What? The action is horrible, meager and sparse? The Dragon Dynasty's releases to this point are huge and are widely regarded as classical in Asian theater. It's a rust. They have succeeded in murdering some Infernal Affairs actors, but they cannot bring life to a failed text. There are screens of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut between each and no continuity in what the characters say. You almost feel that they each give a running monologue and just ignore the other characters. Michael Biehn is really made of wood? Sammo Hung uses a stunt double? Not at all. Yes way. Stay away.
