I have to admit there are few books with corresponding movies that I actually read before I saw the movie adjustment. Nineteen Eight and Four is one of those rare cases. The book was wonderful. It was immersive and interesting prophetically. But the movie just sucked. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I didn't turn off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that the movie was half a two-part assignment for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing to reach the right atmosphere. The acting was nothing short of average, and it was very disappointing seeing the fact that there was not much. For example, the book didn't give me the impression that Winston couldn't stick out more than one syllable at a time. Drilling, disturbing and visually unattractive, the film completely canceled the book. Wait a second ... Isn't it British?
