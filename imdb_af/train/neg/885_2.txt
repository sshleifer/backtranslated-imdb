An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised. There is a lot of talent involved here. Many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately I couldn't enjoy this movie very much, based on three issues I had. <br /> <br /> First, the segments vary in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them clash with the others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped for me. Like seeds of good stories that never come about. I'm not talking about happy ending (or even an end-time), but rather, they even have a basic development or even set-up that draws you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I didn't feel New York and its residents were portrayed properly. <br /> <br /> What you're left with is shorts short films that might be interesting to some, but the average viewer will remain dissatisfied.
