A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman. He was shot by two policemen and then rose from the grave because of a kind of satanic ceremonial ritual formed by an evil heresy. The hunting of women continues through this zombie demon. The sacrificed baby comes back from the grave and wants to kill the maniac again, but only with police help will it come out ... <br /> <br /> A bloody 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies, doll -babies, S&M, corrupt and twisted policemen, refugees who seek refuge in Jesus Christ and three text screens at the end of the film that explain what ultimately happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we should know that !) ... Two decent deviant shots can't save the situation. I saw the worst horror flicks, but this one was also bad. Recommended only for the die-very-hard fans of the genre.
