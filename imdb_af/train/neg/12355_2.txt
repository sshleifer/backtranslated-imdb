After reading a lot of reviews, I don't know what movie some people are watching, but it was clearly not the same. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. The acting, mainly Moore's, is just awful. The woman can't act. Nice tits, but she just can't act. She didn't appear to be the real character at any stage. Instead, it is spoiled. Hollywood actress goes to the beach to congratulate the boys. <br /> <br /> And that's what this movie is ultimately - Hollywood make-believe. The training order is over. Politics - over. The political correctness - above it. The battle scenes - you guessed it, on top. Your goal is to get in and out without being traced. So what are you doing? Why shoot so many laps and make as much noise as possible. O. G.I. Jane, you can always be my wing man. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets it, we end up with Top Gun with tits. <br /> <br /> What is more expected of commercial American films? Not much I think.
