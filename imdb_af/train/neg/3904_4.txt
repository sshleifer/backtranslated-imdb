I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the greatest single novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a palimpsest. <br /> <br /> Comparison with the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable. The version is much more faithful to the spiritual spirit of the book and much more enjoyable to look at. There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (who previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twins) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriate Frank Churchill decorative. The production is attractive, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several major issues. The first is Mark Strong. First, he doesn't seem right to Mr. Knightley didn't. This is perhaps because he plays the role of a sensual Victorian parsonage. It's very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of the length. Simply put, the film is too short - to get the right kind of feeling it should be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally, and much, there is the quality of the adjustment. Austen is a dream of an adapter - all the dialogue is already there. It should only be pruned and properly arranged. Andrew Davies seems to think differently. First of all, it's a pretty bleak movie, and Emma's last thing is bleak. More importantly, Davies has seen it fit to rewrite the end as a kind of bucolic festival. Which planet, or minor work by Thomas Hardy, is it from? It is completely out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe it is extremely suspicious to try to improve. <br /> <br /> Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
