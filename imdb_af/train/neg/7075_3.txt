This is at least the third redesign of this movie, so if you see it, there is a feeling of deja vu, don't be surprised. All they did was change the story and tell it differently, but the differences were not significant. And it doesn't get any better, because the plot is wrong to start with. It never works. And like his predecessors, the play is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that surprises anyone who has never seen the movie, but the end doesn't fit the story. If this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and it was very satisfying and I would have been worth it more. But here's the spoiler and that ultimately pays crime because the criminal is not being caught. I never like this message because of a movie.
