Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: THE KING OF THE DESERT (they wish!) With Melinda / Mindy (returning from the living death 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert junk who has a boyfriend with a boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr ) pull. He ends up in a south-of-the-border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw (a crowded Robert Englund in a toupee). She and her beloved pet powder end up hiding at a petrol station in a petrol station until they are transformed by a newly-blown meteor. The dogs are in a fascinating drag queen "bitch" and Candy develops a very long, spoken, deadly tongue she can't control. Little ones are looking for the stolen loot and other variety of numbskulls add extra complications. <br /> <br /> First, Clarke is great and makes what this movie should be. You look at her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror screens and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguise, including an obvious, very latex body suit ... and wonder how this actress comes a great star. It's too bad that the rest of this cult effort doesn't meet her promise. <br /> <br /> Blame / writer Sciamma, who thinks the foreign performance alone, is enough to sustain ... but his vulgar gags, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitutes for a true sense of humor no. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, many cliff colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert runs. Lucky for Sciamma that Clarke is in his movie because she's watching you alone.
