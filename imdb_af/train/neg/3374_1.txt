This movie is considered by some to be classical - I have no idea why. It's terrible to be laughing. The only saving grace with this movie is the rendering of cheesy lines that are so curly that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are some good songs and good choreography in this movie, but so what! There's no plot, it's in a theater with no change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressed as ever. My brother has ever forced me to watch this movie because he said I wouldn't believe how bad a movie could be! He was right. <br /> <br /> Usually with a movie, this terrible, I would recommend that people shouldn't see it, but in this case I think people should, because that will put every other bad movie you saw in perspective .
