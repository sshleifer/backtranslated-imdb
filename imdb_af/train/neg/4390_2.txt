The TV guide describes the plot SEVERED TIES as follows: "An experiment on a cut arm goes wrong" so immediately I thought it was about an arm having its own mind as in The BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS OR THE HAND or someone who gets an arm transplant as in the body parts. Both sites are being tested, or being more accurate and tested, so I was curious how the producers would approach the story. I actually thought they made an arthouse movie like PI at the beginning of the film using B&W photography, but the makers were tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a spicy comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD. I have very little to say about this, except I didn't like the EVIL DEAD movies and I didn't have a deviation from SEVERED TIES and it really seems unfair that movies like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world crying for condoms
