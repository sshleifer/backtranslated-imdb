I've always been interested in anything about Bigfoot, and when I was looking for a movie to rent, this one caught my eye. It was the WORST $ 4.50 I have ever spent and I want my money back! Please do not waste your money from this! It was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring and I chose myself a lot and I didn't even watch it all the time. I just took care of it. The acting was terrible, the consequences were terrible, everything was just really bad and tasteless. It was all a very bad, boring movie and total waste of time and money. I hope one day they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then I have to sit down through many cheap dudes like this one to find the right masterpiece.
