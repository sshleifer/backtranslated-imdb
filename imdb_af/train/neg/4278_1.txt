I just bought this movie for a goat at the National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I felt I was disapproving. <br /> <br /> I don't know I've seen a worse movie than this. Honest. And I will never write a negative review of a movie, because I don't have such a great respect for the subject, it's Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? This is a musical biography? Yes, many of the songs by Foster have been captured here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Core-type numbers that span more than the Mississippi Delta. I mean, someone paid to write these drives? Secondly, the true story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why don't you even come to it? Thirdly, what did they have on the big Ray Middleton to get him to do this movie? Pictures of him with little boys? With Communists? What a waste of great talent. <br /> <br /> So, friends of Foster, and the truth and good entertainment, be scared ... be very, very, scared.
