Horror fans (I'm talking to the 12-year-olds, but if you are under 12, I apologize for what you might consider insulting). In short, if you appreciate disturbing your imagination through well-written, original storytelling, underlined by unpredictable well-planted rare, and delivered by convincing performances, then I can heartily recommend - REMOVE THIS STEAMERS - made by directors who seem to have passed long ago have their sales by date. It's no coincidence that almost every episode feels like it's been made in the 1980s. Not to blame on the shoulders of some of these old boys (or even the 80s) because where would we be without some movies like Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker? (Actually, Clive, WTF you're doing there? Smooth to see Romero had the good sense to give it a go, because I'm sure he was asked to participate ...). More perhaps, we should point the finger at creator Mick Garris, whose religious missions include the logical denial and depressed-bad-touched TV remake of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'The Shining'. Perhaps this is an indication of the state of television today. Are we so hungry with a good TV horror that we welcome an old, messy shock that separates our networks? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Normally, I wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't debate the mistakes and merits of a production, but I just agree. However, since this series is no longer earned (with perhaps the only exception to the theme), I write it as more of a warning than a review: DO NOT REMOVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you disagree with me, it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors are a much better place to start, but if this Masters of Horror is only assessed on these works, they would never be allowed to graduate even with their bachelor's degree. Unless of course they are studying for a degree from the University of S ** t.
