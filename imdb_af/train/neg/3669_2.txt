I really can't think of anything good to say about this movie ... not one thing. The script is a nightmare. The author fades the line between chemical and biological properties and does not seem to understand the difference. You would think they would at least get a technical advisor. The performances were bad by most of the cast ... though I didn't really blame them. The material really stinks. The editing was just as bad. I'll just stop now. It's all bad 2/10
