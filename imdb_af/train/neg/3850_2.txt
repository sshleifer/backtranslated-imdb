I attended this movie at SXSW with the director. A lot of people came out, and the audience barely got polite applause in the end. Of the 60 or 70 movies I've seen at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> At 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes long. You get the main characters' failed and retrieved communications to communicate in real-time. The same grimaces, handed mouth movements, kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over. We get the point. <br /> <br /> One site actually compares this work with Mike Leigh. What drugs should you have to make the statement? Since Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, you might enjoy a Heavy Duty Replica Touch Screen to appreciate this movie. Incredibly, it won a jury award during the festival. You can bet it hasn't won an audience prize.
