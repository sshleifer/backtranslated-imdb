I recently visited a Russian forum from our TV channel that showed this movie. Well, 99 percent of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more true facts from our space achievements in this movie. But anyway, writers have something different ...: (We are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here. We pride ourselves on all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science to the other. So, I'd like to ask authors: Where's our LUNOHOD? And where, hell, our MIR station? Ah? It is very certain that LUNOHOD events occurred much earlier Armstrong's "Walk on Moon". science bugs - I really have no time and space here!
