The point of Wolfe's original novel - indeed the point of the whole story - is that things are happening because of a meticulously calculated sense of opportunism. The goal is survival within a particular type of lifestyle. The novel is full of evil. The only emotional relationship is between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and it's only touched. With it everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity, power, money or self-aggravation. <br /> <br /> Wolfe has been criticized for skipping every character and every social segment of New York City. His reaction was a denial. He lived in New York himself and belongs to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume to deny he didn't like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is not a dummy.) The so-called weaknesses are what made the novel unforgettable. Nobody was good. And Sherman McCoy broke, a professional protester for social justice. The movie throws it all away and puts a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel is actually rooted. Every event was not only possible but thoroughly credible. Wolfe may have made a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get inside a system and record his details. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of us found ourselves, as Sherman and his mistress do, stuck in the South Bronx, threatened by some black children, and made a breakaway after being in one of them bumped. The scene is conveyed neatly to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after that scene, the movie does not seem to trust its audience and sometimes it becomes terrible in its attempt to spell out its message, but the message is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit a kid and be arrested for as he is in the novel, but he will not return to jail after his release in his phenomenally expensive apartment, pick up a shotgun out and start shooting in the ceiling with it, as he was in the move. In what is supposed to be a funny scene, ceiling gips fall all over the party guests and they shout and shout. It simply wouldn't have happened. The film left the novel's unspeakable detailed reality in the dust. Wolfe's sensibility, the work he put into capturing the goods, is lost. What we get instead is a noisy, fantastic and foolish scene that does nothing but stir up the audience. Similar empty scenes follow and scream for Wolfe's veracity. <br /> <br /> The movie also fails because it pushes many sin and salvation into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" at the opera. We get lectures on delivering a poet with AIDs. We see a lot of debt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bank and gives one of the final speeches on how we should all start acting again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after changing himself to a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman gets away by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the movie like a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head. <br /> <br /> The movie not only makes points that are already naughty and original, it overestimates them, as if the audience was unable to absorb any subtleties. <br /> <br /> It's not the act or the poor direction. The movie is not bad in that respect. And photography is also pretty good, including two spectacular shots - the trucks of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. This is the script that has been thoroughly botched. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is about in the conception and performance. It likes the little details from the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is called Marshall. Who will call the dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost entirely in the second half and hardly ever looks worth it. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's cynical redneck right-wing vineyard can be offensive to many, but he understood the cojones. Unfortunately, the authors and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and gave the opportunity to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.
