How can a large German TV station broadcast such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid each play. Even the famous Gottfried John plays very poorly, especially in the double murder, how amateurish .......! The screen plan is very, very expanded - perhaps to fill 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while you look! Of course, the set is very often a blue screen, e.g. the screens on the ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, the sound and the dubbing are very poor - probably the reason: different languages ​​of actors - but: other international productions deal with this much more professional. Advice: DO NOT look - it's a deadly waste of time!
