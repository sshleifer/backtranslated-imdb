After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad I wasn't the only person in the world, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice in a grave and walks to the lid. I anxiously waited for an explanation for this strange behavior. Of course, I assumed he had something to do with the malicious behavior at home, but since he was murdered by the first rising body (referred to as Zombie # 1), these scenes have absolutely no meaning. Please, if anyone out there knows, Carradine knows how to climb into graves - leave the rest of us there! <br /> <br /> All the action is limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is suffocated by Zombie # 1. So far so good. But then we find the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, for some moonlight filming in the cemetery, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave, from which Zombie # 1 emerged, but Ireland succeeds in hitting him in the open grave, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I think we can find out that Strickler was already dead (a witch?), But why he changed from normal appearance to rotting flesh version by flying into Zombie # 1's grave, is never explained. (Taking into account how ruthlessly these zombies are moving, I would have thought he would have preferred to remain in his "normal" form until his business was closed). This scene also raises a question - just who is the Heck IS Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the opening credits of the movie, but who knows which one or why he has a specific resentment against the movie staff. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie # 2 played by the trees as we saw Zombie # 1. (This leads to instantaneous confusion about how many zombies are actually there). Then, in the best 1950s horror movie fashion, Ireland can run while flying. He knocks his head on the tiny tombstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (was it not so nice to chisel John Carradine a tombstone for a cat he hardly knew?) Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 is Destruction at the home destroyed. He easily sends three movie crew members, and then picks up the stairs. Believe Domergue hears him and thinks it's lover John Ireland back from his night shooting, go out. When she saw that it was only Zombie # 1, she shouted out and pulled back to a bedroom where she got Ireland's revolver. While starring Carole Wells crashes at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who lights it on a mirror in his bedroom) does. With his sweet time (and only after more sweepstakes from his hip flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that hits the viewer in the last quarter of this movie is how fast the stars will scream and shoot). Domergue comes back in the corridor and ready, but misses Macauley for Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He has a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrible Domergue back, right in the weapon of Zombie # 1. <br /> <br /> Carole Wells is now out of her shower and drying out when she hears shootings and Domergue's screams; she also doesn't feel a great urgency to investigate. So during this time Zombie # 1 has time to string. Pull out the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's pending look and fall dead. The next time we see her in a stream outside the house (???) - but later on. Meanwhile, Ireland has recovered its senses and stumbled into the house where he discovered Zombie # 1's bloody massacre. Although Ireland only stumbled across 3 murdered people, he is more concerned that his film is exposed and destroyed! Gracious to him (and the audience) throwing Zombie # 1 a few movie equipment on his head from the 2nd floor. This is the last thing we see from Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience is treated to a fitting of all the deaths, suggesting that the new ones are the old "mirror". How deep. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 2 came close to home (remember, these zombies move as slowly as molasses in January) where he sees Carole Wells floating in a stream and fishing her out How did she get there ? Did Zombie # 1 carry her, throw her in and then just move up the room to waste John Ireland? Apparently, one of the original victims in the bath was drowned, so Wells should also drown (but why not out in a stream, rather than in the bath, never explained). Zombie # 2 never makes it home (everyone is dead anyway, thanks to Zombie # 1), but rather carries Carol Wells back to the cemetery. As the end credits flash on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love still in his arms down in the open grave. <br /> <br /> The viewer continues to wonder: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie # 1's tomb? Why is Zombie # 2 recorded? And what happens if Zombie # 1 gets together and wants to get back - is Zombie # 2 going loose, or will there be a zombie battle? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly died Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine - where will he stay? After all, we know from the early scenes that he is clearly at home in the grave. If this plot confuses synopsis of the finals, don't worry because you are not alone.
