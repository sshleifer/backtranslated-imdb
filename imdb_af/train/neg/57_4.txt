What does the "Executive Producer" do in a movie. If I remember correctly, it was the person who raised the financial support to make the movie. You may see in a large number of movies with Sean Connery that he also has the executive producer. Connery raised the money himself as he is a big player.

It's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive and the star of the movie are one and the same, the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story / script not about. <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis, a boiling-bimbo kink waitress who saves a visiting dignity, and as a reward gets a top diplomat. Probably? As things progress, Ms Davis (who has difficulty connecting two sentences), finds in more exorbitant and less likely situations. When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn, who is also the film's executive producer, do you understand what I'm saying about the story / script that's not about
