I didn't expect it to be a good movie, but I didn't expect it to be so terrible. I hated the mother character so much that I had to turn the channel. I switched it back, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but no. And if the daughter goes to bed, is she embarrassed, or almost out of work, or into madness in her own home? Are you joking? I was educated to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would quickly put her at the nearest hotel if she showed it in my home annoying. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's home. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy anything from it. I tried to give it several chances, I really did. Sorry.
