This kind of "inspirational" saccharin is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs its sentiments like the greatest semaphore on earth. It removes its own interpretation and sense of audience by making choices for it. The big finish is turning into a fast-paced orchestra that is supposed to work like a jumper on a dead car. I think you should have such a reason to feel stupid about watching a movie so simply and juicy. Stripe glowing and you wonder if she really has the depth of the feeling, or if it is the same --- a show, turned on and off like a light. Because I can't see for myself how she can find life in such a dud movie. Although based on a true story, and an inspiring one, I'm sure the set-up, performance and performances like a third-class TV movie or half-witted high school play.
