I remember this movie when I was 13 (many reviews seem to say the same age 13!) With a group of schoolmates. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and fall for the typical commercial advertising that tells us it was a good comedy. We suffered about 45 minutes and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from being able to make Billy Crystal laugh, we didn't laugh. I accidentally stumbled across this review and decided to just register to tell the rest of the world what it is, and if you rent it, you deserve what you get, you are warned!
