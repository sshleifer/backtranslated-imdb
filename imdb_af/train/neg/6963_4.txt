The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy films. They have always been ready to destroy cities by large plastic samples from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never have the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures of the giant octopus to the giant lobster to get the upper hand on humans. It is extremely uncomfortable and ridiculous, but also very pleasant. We do like these creatures and these movies, or not?
