Independent comedy story about the key player, Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up after bedtime with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he met the previous night after his bachelor party. After listening to his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair), he was forced to tell more and more lies to cover his songs. I'm sure most of us are witnessing a story like this at least once before ... on film or on television. The movie is formulable and EXTREMELY predictable. In the end, you might come a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the role gives some importance and keeps it visible. Lee is just right in the lead, and Stiles is fun in a light comic role, unlike the very serious roles she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit that turns out to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, it's not really well written. At least one question is left unanswered: for WAT, exactly, is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's cruel ex-boyfriend, investigated by the IA? <br /> <br /> And I didn't know Buck's character (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; He is a super-unnatural moron that came so fast on my nerves. I begged someone to hit him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: a free, unreasonable comedy by comedian / actor Larry Miller again plays a grouch (in this case it is a bit justified - his character is an ultra conservative minister). <br /> <br /> Not good, but as usual for me I give it a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
