I hired this horrible movie. The worst I have ever seen. I believe a 1st class could have done a better job. The worse movie I've ever seen and I've seen bad people. Nothing scary, except I paid 1.50 to rent it and it was 1.49 too much. The acting is terrible, the characters are worse and the movie is just a piece of garbage. The slower house scenes are such a low budget that it makes a B movied, looks like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if you want to waste a good night and a little money is going to rent this horrible movie. I would rather see killer clowns from outer space as I sit in a bucket of razor than to put through this flop again
