Well, I can't get into the plot, but that's just me. Nice camera movements at times, yet this movie has a beautiful vocal quality. The play is sometimes temporary and entertaining with the occasional pursued series that includes scarcely dressed ladies, who were nice. The climax is confused and unpleasant, but still ... erroneous, asx to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> The stunts are interesting, especially because of the 70-year-old Las Vegas background. There are some jerking hand-camera movements at the end, which guesses me for a while. But I don't think I would just chase the DVD.
