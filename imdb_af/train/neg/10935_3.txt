I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. Being a Mormon, I've always felt that humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us look like a bunch of obsessive wackos. I was hoping it would be the fresh air, the Halestorm movie that I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought, since it had B-list talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson, and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), it should be at least a little funny. And besides, church basket is ripe with potential for many hilarious gags and so on. But I have to say, in the whole movie it seemed as if nobody knew what they were doing. Every joke went flat, and every opportunity for a really funny gag ignored. The dialogue was vague, and the film has the worst character development I've ever seen. Every single character, but Wilson's, was less than one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that the movie was rewritten after nine, is still as ingenious as the train wreck I saw. I cannot put into words the rage I have seen through this. My friends and I were extras in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I have to say, I avoided all contact with him after the show. He waited at the door, apparently ready for feedback. I could not tell that his film had not only torn for half an hour of my life, but it had a nasty, painful scar that I would never forget. <br /> <br /> Here are some specific issues I had: There was a small love story subplot between the fan and the piano player, but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to over give, so my friends and I always left to wonder why we were supposed to care for these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were many subplots that appeared every now and then, and each promised the audience the chance to laugh, but each came and went into a smoke pool and ended before you even started to care. That was pretty much the whole movie feeling. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great fall-out and I feel bad for everyone who expects the first REAL-funny Mormon movie. True, the jokes in this one are not too exclusive to Mormons. Then again, it's hard to tell what a joke was and what was a loud, fancy sensation in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please, don't see this movie. Keep in mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. Save yourself the disappointment I have gone through
