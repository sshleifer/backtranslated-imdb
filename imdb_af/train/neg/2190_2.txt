** Possible Spoilers Forward ** <br /> <br /> Jason (including Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the most inaccurate accident accident ever. Leith is approached and the doctor takes her noggin back to his home and renews the head in his lab. The house's exterior was allegedly filmed at Tarrytown's Lyndhurst estate; The labones were shot in someone's cellar. The banded head is kept alive on "laboratory equipment", which is almost cheap enough for Ed Wood. Some of the library music? The movie's high point ?? later appeared in Andy Milligan's body. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of Ever's misfires, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, the good doctor cuts joints in search of a body worthy of his wife's ground noodle. The end, in rough prints, features a bit of splashing and blending when it comes to the courgette head out of the cupboard, to bring the movie to a welcome end. This thing took three years to be released and then audiences gave it the bad reception it deservedly earned. Between these were PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a few others, 1959 declared The Year Of The Turkey.
