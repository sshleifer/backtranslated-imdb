I didn't expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a Miracle". It seems that this movie is 10 times worse than the "life ...". I have an impression that the director / writer only talks to the audience: "Let me see how much emptiness you (audience) can sustain". Dialoogleer is empty, ... scenario is minimalist. In a few moments photography is very nice. Few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it's really hard to laugh at this "comedy". I laughed at myself because I could see the movie to the end. If you can lift yourself above this director's bike, you'll find good acting (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek), and very good performance by Emir's son Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make top rated movies. Instead, he chose to do this low budget just for my private theater movie, with an arrogant attitude towards world trends and negligence towards his old supporters.
