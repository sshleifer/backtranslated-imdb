In the future of 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman, held hearings on TV's first uncensored network. Their samples are programming, which plays as a series of sketches. I can call the good 'skit' movies on one side and not use my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video". Notice how I didn't call "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this film is death in film form. None of the sketches are even funny at all, or even the least clever. It takes a great deal of indifference on the filmmakers not to even get one out of me. <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> Cookie Cage: Dody Dorn is Full Frontal
