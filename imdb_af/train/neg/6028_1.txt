I'm a Christian ... and I feel this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> No one except hard core, Christians of Bible Belt will like this movie. The message is just in your face. If you want a wider audience, you need to be more subtle. You can't blow the dad to carry the Bible around and carry it with him at every stage. Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Poor direction. The unveiling of people who had missed had to have been terrifying, but it was laughing. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies: "Oh my God! People miss!" The scene in the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you found your relative's clothes next to you, you wouldn't just shout "o my god". They disappeared! They are missing out! "and start crying and screaming. You'd first be in denial ... you didn't just want to come to that conclusion. Look at Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting on the lawn with a stack of clothes and boots next to him, I fell off the couch and I laughed so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and so distracting, it was as if the composer in his own world recorded his own movies "Here's my chance to get excited", "here's my chance to do action!" STOP MY UNDERSTANDING HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL A good score that supports the screen. Need a UNDER score, but instead it was as much in your face as the message was. <br /> <br /> Writing was slim, so was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron, Chelsea was the worst: "you understand not! People miss! "Brad Johnson was laughable. The two striking acts came from the Antichrist and the older man (sorry, can't remember their names). In the look of" making "(to answer my question of "what did they think ???", the producers and filmmakers and actors were battling themselves ... and saying, "We're going to reach wide audiences" and "Brad Johnson is amazing" and "it's just like a Hollywood movie "I came to the conclusion that they just do not know what the" heck "they are doing. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the effort to give the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea Movie is the best medium possible to do it, watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, TIGERS, CONTACT, Christ's passion, even O'BROTHER, WHERE ART IT'S The bottom line is that the movie should be made by people that has talent and vision, unfortunately it was not.
