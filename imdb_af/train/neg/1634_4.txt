START SPOILER: Sufficiently funny and memorable for Mr. Chong's literal dress-smoking scene: Chong smells cool kitchen cake in his tub, light, cough and hooks with violence for a seemingly eternal, then with perfect aplomb and not for a moment, recharging the bowl properly, lightening Tokes. END SPOILER. Oh, I started losing faith less than halfway through the proceedings. It seemed to me that the melancholy duo was presumptuous and less than tolerant. I appreciated the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer a better business. Yet the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked fratbros or the viewers who are so weak to be poured out by a stoner when they are the former newer. Striking guest appearance by Paul Reubens squirting obsessions in pre-Pee-wee form.
