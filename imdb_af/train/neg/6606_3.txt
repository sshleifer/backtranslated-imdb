Please don't hate me, but I have to be honest, look at this movie, I had a lot of fun, <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a silly role and stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... A Total insult to the original One Holi .... well .. it was OK! Because of the tradition, every movie had one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Many UNEEDED stupid Song jee Le ... Looked like a Playboy Song Stupid Song ... <br /> Unlike Songs. The movie was OK It was Ram Gopal Verma's own adaptation ... If you think so, you'll keep this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie depends on the viewer and in his opinion whether he thinks movie is total Copy He / She wants to hit her head on Cinema Seat OR if he / she thinks of the directors Own Look, he / she will be relaxing and watching this movie <br /> <br /> Anyways I've looked at both ways, and I will congratulate Ram Gopal for this disaster he made. <br /> <br /> Well, some other things that bothered the CAST were incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own Movie Remake Funny what was director thinking) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek was intended for this role Despite a special appearance in the Mehbooba song) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was Right Tabu was ready for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would have been Great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute .... Oops, sorry, hehehehe, he was OK I couldn't think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The movie would even be a corpse as the Cast was good <br /> <br /> I wasn't even exciting, the movie was just OK, just to look <br /> <br /> Overall rating <br /> <br /> Board .. 8/10 I got a credit for him. Camera ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 Unnecessary in the movie, could have been better, easily played on the ears in PCs and IPod's and Stuff Cast ... 1 / 10 <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
