I fled through Netflix and stumbled on this movie. With the good memories of the book as a child, I decided to check it out. It's a movie you really have to pass on. <br /> <br /> It's just not worth seeing. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel it will even be for small children. It has no magic that the book contains. This movie is not terrible, but you will only find that you do not care for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that come just as strange. The witch character is not very good. The family acts as if it is not a big problem that these strange things happen. I know this is a children's movie. If an older audience should not look too deep in things, but feel the whole movie just as it is written and produced by people who have never had any movie experience. <br /> <br /> The DVD I started out jumped into the movie in the last few moments, and instead of correcting it, I just switched it off and returned it to Netflix. I really didn't mind how it was done. Skip this movie and read the book earlier.
