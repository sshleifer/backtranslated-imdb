I'll go to the movie within a minute. First, someone wanted to have evidence of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, claiming that the US earned the 9-11 attacks. Well, here's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> In the first crusade, when Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned a 300-Jewish synagogue and every woman and child Muslim was killed. on the Temple Mount. I can tell you that the story is still being told in the Middle East today and we still pay for it. "<br /> <br /> We're still paying for it? Whaddya means" us ", paleface? The Marines didn't hit the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in truth, Clinton never really came out and he said that we deserved 9-11, like all his statements during his presidency, he ENLARGED that we deserved 9-11, just indicate "fact" A, B, C, and D, and let the listener deduce that they have to pick up X. When most of Clinton's facts are added to guacamole. <br /> <br /> But this is next to the point, we're here to talk to movies, not politics. Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can't get rid of his twisted politics, it was just a matter of time before focusing his paranoia and bitterness on the Reagan era, and the better than Stone almost dreams come true, on the day Reagan almost bought the farm, unable to find any shameful plots or schemes in Hinckley's murder attempt not, but he finds one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority, Haig is transformed from a civil servant who really had to wipe out his remedial civilians in a mysterious megalomania. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands together like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to release the Hounds. Stone even recruits the smarmiest person in Hollywood to play our former foreign minister Richard Dreyfuss. A man you love to hate on sight. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is OK. Average, below average. Don't rent or buy. Try to catch it on the cable. 4 out of 10.
