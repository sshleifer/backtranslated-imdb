Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a well-known actor. Almost any movie he was in is better for it. Now, oh, George had absolutely nothing to do with this movie, but once he said something that described the movie to a T. <br /> <br /> I don't remember his exact words, but he basically said that great writing could save bad acts, but big actions can't save bad writing. Never before has this observation been much more valuable than in "The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mama". <br /> <br /> The deciding factor of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look at the parts, but they do a particularly good job of imitating the real deal (ways and everything). This movie should stand as a lasting will for their talents. It says, this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to (you guess) WRITE. <br /> <br /> Apart from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a short gag with a taxi, this movie is an absolute task to go through. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the beautiful British woman. What I want to see is Stan and Ollie (or at least their stand-ins). Too much screen time was devoted to the layout of the plot or the non-very funny secondary characters who said the plot had turned. <br /> <br /> But even if this movie were all the jokes, it would still leave us with ... <br /> <br /> ... QUESTION # 2: Most of the jokes are what I would call a "water-down" slapstick. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watering"? <br /> <br /> In slapstick, a character is in an exaggerated way injured for comic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ... or how about Laurel & Hardy?). In a slapstick (as I define it), a character is hurt or uncomfortable, and the filmmakers play it for comic effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe an illustration will help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill fell off and he put it back on. This is classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "jewel", Ollie accidentally bursts with some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue in their cheerful way. It's not slapstick. It's not even funny. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of such jokes. It's like they're this movie's bread and butter. The authors and directors only take these dull moments and act like they are supposed to be funny. Granted, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can cut it just as smoothly. <br /> <br /> Short story short: The movie just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot's and Sartain's ability to personalize Stan and Ollie. Instead, the writing capitalizes on plot outline and lamb jokes. To watch this movie, basically look at two excellent mimics that didn't get any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but an amazing sleep aid. <br /> <br /> I say giving one a miss and sticking to the real deal (as long as you get away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
