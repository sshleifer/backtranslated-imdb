I won't mention any of the plot, because although it would be highly predictable anyway, the one striking plotwending anywhere in the movie remarks is given in the plot summary here, and even in synopsis on my Netflix envelope. I might have enjoyed it more if I didn't know. Can be. This film has a misleadingly good role. Most of them deservingly have the rather limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to hold William McNamara, but it was clear by design. And there were a few fast-paced naaktonele by the callipygean Lenore Zann. But none of this brings me the slightest recommendation. Shouldn't any of these good actors actually read these scripts before you sign up?
