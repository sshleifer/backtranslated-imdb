With all the European studios involved in this one, you would think you would at least get a nice picture; but local color is kept to a minimum. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent to play a Spanish police spokesman? The story is hopelessly confused. There is a supposedly romantic back story that is deliberately confused - is she or is she not a lesbian? - No purpose whatsoever at all The police officers are the stupidest to conquer a series of killer movies in a long time. There is apparently a message about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-30th century. But since everyone involved is dead, you don't see the point. Despite the fight against the bull part of the narrative (which part? Who can tell it), don't you even get a good fight for a fight against the bull? Merit Hemingway would have struck the director - with my blessings.
