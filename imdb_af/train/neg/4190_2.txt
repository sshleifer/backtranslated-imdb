I saw this movie a few months ago in the town that Greendale appeared in the movie. This is the only reason I have seen it. Another local who was there just sent me an email to show a repeat because the first one sold out and people were pushed away. His editorial comment in his cover is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a Neil Young fan or live in / near Greendale (if you know the right name), skip this movie. This is mostly an ego journey for the filmmaker. It has no observable plot, the music is just OK, and too many lyrics are incomprehensible. This makes it impossible to follow which small pieces of plots may be. <br /> <br /> I don't have to put in a heater warning because there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 1.5 / 10, but it's just for the entertainment to see the locals in a movie. It was not worth the $ 6. I can rent a video camera and drive around "Greendale" and make a better movie myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * environmental message movie without any plot, rent Koyaanisqatsi.
