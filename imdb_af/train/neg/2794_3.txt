Well, because I'm a musician I thought, maybe I'll check out this movie on TMC, nothing else good. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's just half done. I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting, crappy filming and crappy effects. But no, I don't even get that. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping maybe a few laughs, but I wasn't sure if they were trying to throw in one-liners or not. But now I have to sit here and look at the rest just until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I'm going to sit here and tap until I have 10 lines
