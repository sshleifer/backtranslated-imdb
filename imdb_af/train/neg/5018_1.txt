I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, but after reading the box, I thought it sounded like a good story ... but the first problem was that there really wasn't a story. .. or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that there were no characters for these characters. Yes, I went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they didn't mean anything else and didn't like each other. ... so why did they stay together. Error number 3 ... the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled tension (especially with the typical suspense music mentioned in) ... he was unfortunately wrong. It was painful to see a great actress like Amber Benson wasting to make it live back. My only hope is that the money she made here was placed to make her own movie.
