It's a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares it a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues I only felt three and really had some kind of truth from them. I was waiting for the movie to get better, and it did a little, but never better. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting concept, and I wanted to do it well, but it never succeeded. Maybe if they were really stories, it would have worked.
