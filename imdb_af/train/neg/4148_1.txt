I recorded this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into myself. <br /> <br /> I started the movie and soon I moved into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know what is hell This is this movie. Forever. This movie has no value. It didn't even have a plot. There were things going on in every scene, but no general explanation as to why anything happened. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest that you direct the nearest blender with oil and try to keep as many dots in it as you can. You will find that the result is much nicer than this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look first. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you see it, it means they win.
