Yes, stupidity! I just started to look and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "addons" to a story, too many stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to reach comic enlightenment, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Disgrace to spoil one of the divine stories of Arabian North like this. Childish, naive (both in a bad way) and with much magic, I don't think it can hold a child of five for more than ten minutes. Princess is beautiful, but must be tongue-free, because actress does not know how to play a role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad man" is VERY bad. Shame that the "good guy" is not better. Only light in this darkness is of course David Carradine, who unfortunately falls below his level, but at least keeps his actor / "fighter" skills above. I'm still sorry to see him in such a thing, but glad I had to see something in the whole charade, so thank you David. Just, ONLY for him, I give these 2 stars this fiasco ... I'll give him more, but it'll make the final score to the whole movie. The rest is so bad that I will be able to upgrade it, but there is no grade lover, and I think it will be too much.
