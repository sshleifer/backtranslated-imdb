Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood (not even there) and those actors still need a job. The most horrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept looking to see if it would be better, which unfortunately didn't. <br /> <br /> At the end, the credits have given me anxiety. I think there were not many people behind the movie, so they had to slow down the credits ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great guide to making a movie. . Too bad I can't give 0.
