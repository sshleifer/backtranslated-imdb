Blonde and lace were unfit. Basically, it was a rip-off girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too many background sounds and music. GO TO MY BACKGROUNDS AND MUSIC IF YOU PLEASE ME !!!! It starts out very boring, and totally uncomfortable. It doesn't get up to speed quickly, and I feel more frustrated than this nonsense is doing. Perhaps the only thing that saved me from giving this movie 1 is the last 30 minutes. I found it a bit entertaining and interesting because it ended, but it was the only part. Also, I couldn't help but like the characters of Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard. Although this movie does not laugh From me it was my attention. I won't say to avoid this movie altogether, but there are thousands of better movies to give up your time and money than Blonde and Lace.
