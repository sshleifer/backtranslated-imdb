Please don't waste your time. These movies are the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and stupid, Biblical references), and Blade (high tech toys). I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good. But not this stinker. Not even the soundtrack helps it, mostly because the film is about ridiculous, scary classical music rather than the "kick-ass metal" reported. I only heard a metal a few times; Mostly they are tortured violets. Avoid it like garlic and crosses.
