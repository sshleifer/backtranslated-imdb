It's a ghost story. This is a cannibalism story. It's a revenge story. It's a very bad movie with a lot of violence. I think it follows cheaply according to the lines of every treasure movie you've ever seen. It has the usual remote spot, the shark campers, going to the desert. Granted, there are some pretty intensive scenes. It's just so boring. Bad editing and all the works. There are ghost children who sound like they're talking in a waste basket. I'm not really sure what the ghosts are and playing the psycho with the seed cup. It also has the brutal scene where a man eats meat that is actually left by his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it was necessary to show this kind of free, sick violence. I fear that this is just another step in our insensitive evolution. Three are not clever here, no tongue in the cheek, just a sad waste of time. Lots of blood; small plot.
