As a horror movie fan I try to look at all the significant innovations of this genre, especially those of my native theater products. And I can say that the "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as its Russian title) is one of the worst movies among them. First, it can't even scare a little kid, it moves so slowly and so predictably that there's no room for the real horror. Honestly, it's bad at all points: from the goofy plot (I don't know why Russian producers / director decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into a lame and ridiculous contemporary America thriller, the previous reviewer? It does not make a bit of tension and the terrible and cute actors' work All actors, including leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are known in Russia, look like wooden puppets or something and it seems to me that they do not even struggle They didn't speak at all, they spoke their English lines without any expression, and in the end I don't really understand why they filmed this movie in English with Russian actors - I think it was their wrong turn. At least they can throw some American or English actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing, as can the so-called "small US city backgrounds" shot in Estonia. s and looks like this. The only positive moment I found in the "Power of Fear" is the visual effects. They are not excellent, but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is good, at least it doesn't irritate me. That's why I give it two stars. Overall, if you want to see a good horror movie ?? Don't waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that claims a Russian horror, I would recommend finding a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It's really the awesome movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear", but much, much better.
