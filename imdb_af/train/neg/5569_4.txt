I really tried to keep this movie. If I see it, all I can think is, "This man gives me the crawl, I would have received a punitive order." It also cites CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was it really the conversation before you made the movie? "Let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially indifferent people in a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I have seen in life, the last thing on earth that we find attractive in a potential measure is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The mood of the movie is clearly 80's; brooding and slow. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments, very few of them.
