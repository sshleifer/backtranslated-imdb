Difficult to describe this one - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer movies, you will be sure that Haji still looks really hot, although Forry Ackerman hasn't done so well (what does he still do these movies anyway? If I go to him with a camera, will he be in my movie?). It was a pretty fun show - a superhero whose giant moms are her secret weapon - but sometimes it didn't come out for the full length and the jokes were at a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or Abbott and Costello if it's your thing - basically just bad words. Yet I found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons. Good work, but still a basic poor production.
