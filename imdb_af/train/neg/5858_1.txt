It was awarded to the fans, as the "winner takes everything" between two separate "companies" (the World Wrestling Federation and the Alliance): a merger of the former WCW and ECW superstars. Because the final match pushing the superior company was a team-team game, the wrestlers were limited to throwing opponents from each side of the ring to the other, each wrestler being of the opinion that in order to debate their opponents and the match. intensifying, interference is needed. Every wrestler just pumps an opponent with punches, a special move and markers in a partner. The storyline had previously been plagued by Vince's underwing that a member of the Allance would be fraudulent and join the WWF. It was clear with the statement that WWF would dominate. Overall: very innovative storyline but poor performance, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers, because the game format is tag team. The remaining games are just rebellious: <br /> <br /> Edge versus T est: powerful "big boot" by the test, but it didn't show the real talents of both stars <br /> <br /> All the snow to the Christian: good fit, but superfluous to the pay-per-view <br /> Taji versus William Regal: the worst game of the night <br /> <br /> Battle Royal: This was a great fun game to watch, but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only a wrestler who typically appeared on "Heat" and likely to reject a wkw heavyweight (ie The Hurricane that is just like "). an entertainer is hired). Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz: The Best Game of the Night: Jeff Hardy performed a "Swanton Bomb" from the upper cage and through a wooden table and Matt was thrown into the cage, which looked extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore Champion, and Kurt Angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all fundamental stars in the main event at the faction of the Alliance works after the game's outcome, except Booker T., who recently attacked a wrestler on "Raw" and inevitably will be given work. Shane McMahon will somehow return to television, and everyone wanted to see the Alliance's demise and demise to see Stone Cold out of work. The WWF did much better. A game in which all the tiles were brought to one faction would have been better and what ever happened to Kask and Iron Man games?
