Hookers, the moronic merchandising television children's show of the 1990s, should be the most sensible and ridiculous television program ever created. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the point of this show anyway, other than selling second? There is nothing remotely delivered or interesting about this show. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes, which seem like the spandex is bad. <br /> <br /> The early 1990s mullet style hair, earrings, and fashions look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Avoid this performance at all costs!
