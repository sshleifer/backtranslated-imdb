I must admit that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason I watched it was that I wasn't quite happy with Ciaran Hinds as captain. Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I thought when I read the book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only redeeming quality of the movie. The rest is as un-Austen as possible. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Elliot had never walked through the streets of Bath. It was not in her character and it was not only done by a lady of that time. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but that was the worst. Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are completely inappropriate moments, warn those who know the book which is another important part of the book. will miss or completely change. <br /> <br /> And while this version isn't much shorter than the others, it feels like everything is rushing. Very little care has been taken to introduce the characters, to show their attitudes and motives. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they possibly have slaughtered the final scenes this way? N disaster! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the others. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, don't waste your time with it.
