Everyone sees that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. The angry eyes seem to give every enemy. 2. Holding hands to face, mouth agape and scared eyes. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say I hate this show, I'm not watching, but it's like Code Lyoko. We all looked at at least one, I have to say that this show is border-racist, uninteresting and useless. <br /> <br /> Every episode ends with robotic win, except for one exception if robot boat basically allows this exaggerated freakazoid to fly on a jetpack. <br /> <The jokes are pretty rough, I think it's mostly people who say the word "Suck" or farting, I think the bulls of the show are also shocking. <br /> <br /> There is no one who throws a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for whatever reason, what kind of school he goes. Not to mention his older brother, who is border-psychopathic and has no other characteristics. <br /> <br /> The whole show I feel is the finishing touch of megas XLR and Fosters. As you can say, the coop, jamie and Kiva trio, as well as Robotboy, are similar to Megas, where he beats everyone, no matter what the odds are and he is relieved despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There is simply no appeal to this show, I'm surprised it's still going on.
