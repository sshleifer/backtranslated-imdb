Robert Carmichael's Great Ecstasy is in every respect bad film. The screenplay, the brave pace, the lack of depth in any character, the useless sub-plots, the horrible acting, the unnecessary climax may make it the worst movie I've ever seen. I found nothing that stimulated and entertained or intellectually stimulated. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers thought they were making something cumbersome and dark, with its naughty lighting, long stretched silences and vague haunting classic soundtrack. If so, they have completely failed. It just bored me, and I wish I never looked at it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
