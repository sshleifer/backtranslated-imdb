I think it would have been a much better movie if the Cajuns were portrayed in a more credible light. My family is from the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in Southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up talking about as these people did. The Cajuns are portrayed as backward rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people and do not sound uncomfortable when they speak like these people did. All in all, it was a good movie with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers from Lake Charles were, and knowledgeable about the area, but for the love of everything Cajun, the actors must study the language, live among the people you portray and get an understanding of how they are before you try to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much nicer movie!
