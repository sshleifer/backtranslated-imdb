This is the first time I write a comment on a movie on IMDb. but I had to write it for this one. she was 3 hours of untouched torture. from the start you get the idea that the movie will be bad. the acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (love him in Bhagat Singh), but he's at his worst in this movie. Amitabh worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear was missing. Prashant Raj is a non-actor. and the most annoying part of the movie is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took her in this movie. the background count is repetitive. somehow I felt that the ram tried to repeat a sarcara, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work. Please don't
