I'm amazed at the many female voters who even give this movie better marks. My idea of ​​this movie was that the target audience is mature and masculine. Injured and tortured women, ruthless revenge and high body number are typical ingredients introduced into the history of the film by the spaghetti subgenre. The opening and hand crushing are DJANGO rip-offs. However, the shooter lacks the style of eg. DJANGO. Counting, acting and cinematography are at best mediocre, but if you look at the above ingredients, you're in the right place. And the actors don't have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
