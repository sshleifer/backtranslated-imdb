Almost out of the word, this film is poor and does not convict, but then most people will struggle to show the commitment to a manuscript so uninspiring. The dialogue really doesn't and sometimes, as in this case, is less (or should have been). It is also backed up by strange scenes (eg, the Cemetry slow motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but just a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange combination of gangster / situation comedy that I was sure was a good idea at the time, but if ever there was a case for someone who had to be honest with the screenwriter , it was here. <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character who always plays, and I wonder if he has received a script or just filmed and told to respond as normal. Finally - humor. It reminds me of the "Python (I think) quote about Shakespere, of his" comedies "- If he meant to be humor, he would have put a joke in it. Well, I didn't see one. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - I did because I watched it with a friend and hoped it would be better. <br /> <br /> It didn't.
