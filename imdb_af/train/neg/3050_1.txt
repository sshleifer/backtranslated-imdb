Just when I thought I'd complete a whole year without giving a movie a "Bomb" rating, a friend brought this infamous tear to my home last night. I was afraid of the worst to know his reputation and it was as God-fearing as I expected. It is a Mexican mess, written in English, and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects, and features a scary Santa who doesn't work in the North Pole, but instead of a cloud in outer space and who doesn't have small elves, helps him make his toys, but rather all the different groups of children from almost every country there. The opening sequence, where St Nick warmly visits as he observes monitors who work hard all these kiddies while singing awful holidays in different languages, seems to be going on forever and without. Obviously, this Santa Claus does not comply with child labor laws! <br /> <br /> Eventually we get a little nice and slender red fit pupil of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn Santa's Christmas rounds into a nightmare . Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it is bound to scare little children and turn them off from Santa Claus and holidays forever. Strange, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas film, which somehow makes the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on. It makes my personal list of the worst movie I've ever seen easy, but I'm sure it's nothing unique.
