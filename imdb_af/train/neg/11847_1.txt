I'm worried about how bad this movie is. As a surprise to early 20th-century Hollywood artists, it puts a new, low-level past The Moderns or Custle Will Rock and I never thought I'd see a movie worse than this 2. They conceded that they were a little different environment. period. Nevertheless, the intention and results were alarmingly the same. <br /> <br /> First, there is the terrible casting: Eddie Izzard and CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, did you owe this man something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even begin to attempt to capture the appearance or sound of the period they are portraying. <br /> <br /> Well, Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of Bogdonovitch's photos weren't much better. Guess rubs against Welles & Hitch & Ford carried long ago. Still good to offer TCM.
