I only saw Adam for four boys for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believe the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same ages as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter, in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard, spoke about the same values ​​and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without having the more boisterous aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> As all the Stoddard boys serve, they serve in the First World War. In this case, the youngest only serves an eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But if a female minx comes in this whole male household and disturbs things? It's Susan Hayward's work here. In one of her earliest prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one boy, has a relationship with another, and begins a play for the third. It is an early precursor of the kind of a part that later made her an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I think it was as strong as a model of decor such as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter image, everyone is afraid to tell Father what is going on. The boys and also their ruling Ingrid Bergman. Here is where the plot became a bit silly. Bergman is introduced to us as a governor who is hired by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers financial backlogs in business. Bergman must be released. She goes back to France and returns to the family years after the children grow up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't believe the kids need a governor now. Hayward is right when she confronts her that it is not the children who brought her back. In the normal course of events, Bergman would continue her life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said a quarter to a third of the movie I had worked out was worked out. This may be the reason for the many plot holes we have. <br /> <br /> It is too bad that Ingrid and Susan couldn't have made a movie in the fifties when Hayward was up and down and Bergman just made a return. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason for seeing Adam's four sons. And I'm prepared to believe that a good portion of Ingrid was left on the cutter floor.
