When I watched this movie, I saw the guy from Buffy, Xander, and he figured out how much he still plays in the movie. Now a strange movie I can stand, as it is a good dose of strange, such as David Lynch movies, twin peaks, highway, etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. However, this made me remember the crazy websites about conspiracy theories that make absolutely no sense. I mean, come to people Nazis who merge with America to make an unholy trinity of evil forces? I was surprised they didn't call the hollow earth in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people. Perhaps if you had 60 grams of heroine with this movie, it would make sense, but I do not accept drugs as I do not condemn this film. It must be burned, carved and forgotten, as well. "Xander might get another acting job. However, it was not his play, it was good, but the writing just made no sense. Sorry.
