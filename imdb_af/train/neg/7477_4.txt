Very dense road movie with some comic relief sent by the excellent John Cleese (though he really does his show in Fawlty Towers). Looks like beating the top slapstick to a sleek sentimentality at the hat and the worst part of the movie is that Martin and Hawn have to "find" themselves, who they are, and so on. See it at your own risk.
