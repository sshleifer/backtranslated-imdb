The concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about 10% of the film's appeal; The other 90% can be attributed to the flaming weakness. To say that Sean Young's action as a so-called district attorney is wood is a gross understatement. With her thin suit and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the audience of her fiery hatred for men. Why would she just ask her a friend to just sit as a prostitute, so she could arrest the police trying to pick them up? This hatred is also the only reason she relentlessly pursues a distorted photographer who gives women a collective excitement and the driving force behind this crazy movie. If you look at a young person, you go from a fridge to a full frontal nudity, do it little interest, but the mood she sticks next to a fire next to a lake does it. When she looks at her rant and rave about her self-denial and sexual frustration, Love Crimes makes the rent, but occasionally it is occasional. Despite her urge to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, her police skills escaped completely in tears of her own effort and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent job as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in sleep with the enemy, it is certain that hell can work in it. But I can't help but wonder if the conspicuous lack of energy Young brings to the film is contrary to his cunning. I guess this and the result is a thriller with excitement that is really bad and yet comedy.
