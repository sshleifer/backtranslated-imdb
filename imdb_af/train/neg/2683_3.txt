Have you ever wondered what would happen if some Beverly Hills 90210 characters were thrown into a Thai jail? If so, it's your movie. It's Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. It would be good, but the story was poorly executed. Contracted plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues are plentiful. This little movie did not deserve the right to be so cryptic, as it is finally. Potential spoiler and impossible plot line - the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and are about to kick them out. (This moment is played improperly with the same ceremony and gravity as the moment they are arrested at gunpoint). Later, the same hotel employee is found somehow - and Bangkok is a big city, you think I was there - and testify against the girls, as if some free Mai Tais justified 40 years in prison. C'mon. Rent another day in paradise.
