I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet" s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson's was fast and to date Laurence Olivier was the best - hands off. But now we come to Maximilian Schell's on the Bard. <br /> <br /> For one, this is a shortened version of a German TV production by William Shakespeare's honorable chestnut. But if there is a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse version somewhere, it should be performed at primary school level. <br /> <br /> After I saw it on MST3K, Mike and the old boy boy jolly help good jabs, putting the depths of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of Germans English play and it looks like an Ingmar Bergman rejected. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. Best Lines? "I'm going to unleash the Great Dane", "I don't think so, breathing", "Meet the Beatles", "Hey, Daddy, will you help me with my science project" and my personal favorite, during a party - "Garrison Keillor leaves Germany (YAAAY !!). " <br /> <br /> But then there is Schell, who plays Shakespeare's greatest character, just like a shopping mall model, just not as expressive. Undoubtedly, he's a good actor, but here he and Paul Newman come in "The Silver Chalice". Have you ever seen that one? You MUST see these two on a double account! <br /> <br /> Ultimately this is one case where it is true that you are much better off just reading the book. At least, Ricardo Montalban didn't baptize the book. <br /> <br /> One star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, not-so-sweet prince.
