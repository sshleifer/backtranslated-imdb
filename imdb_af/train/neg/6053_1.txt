absolute trash. I like Halloween and since then Johnny is in a downward spiral. It's about the wells. we got it John. pro-lifers is scary! You don't have to make a rogue film that puts hell out of me to tell me. <br /> <br /> The pacing is far from here. John didn't feel like much here. He said he didn't write this junk. There are many times when the camera is just waiting for the actors to look stupid or silly. I love the long cut. Too bad carpenter does not know how to use it. He must be with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop making yourself fool and kill me!
