"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. The "Loony Tunes" have many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not many. But Loonatics is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from programs like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no resemblance to the original characters and the stories were boring and poor. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This view just doesn't work. This terrible waste of animation is a complete failure and it should be nothing more than a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
