I thought it was a successor to some kinds, and it is meant to be the original from 1983. But a successor does not take the original plot and does not destroy it. <br /> <br /> I really had very little expectation of this movie, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. No tension - I actually feel brighter, poorly acting, and so filled with technical errors, so as a computer spirit I just can't believe it. They tried to make it a mix between a generic war film and 24 hours. But it's not even worth getting a low budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie, it's a total waste of time. Rather place the original. The theme is still valid. Don't leave too much power in a machine. And the play and plot are much more exciting and compelling.
