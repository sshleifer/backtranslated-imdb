I must honestly say that I couldn't stop watching this movie from the second it started. Simple for how bad it was !!! It's like watching paint dry, just a lot more confusing. I mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen, anything in reality, preferably something that makes the whole movie sense! At the end of the film I actually sat there wondering if there was any chance that I missed the first hour that explained everything or that I accidentally passed the movie and the parts sticking to the plot missed, missed (if there was one)! The most important thing that really confused me about this movie is, at the end, the head girl (if there was indeed a head girl) was in some kind of alternative reality, I mean what hell was going on? Suddenly she woke up and was in a spiritual institute, chained to a bed of doctors or something intoxicated, then faster than it would have me slit my wrists, it returned and she became by a random vampire eaten! It made no sense! I'm tempted to email the makers and claim my time back. I mean I wasted 2 hours of my life! It's good to know if the filmmakers actually know what it's all about! just seemed to have worked out all the pieces that made it healthy, although I think the movie should have been 4 hours to make it happen! I was completely with the other person who wrote the other review, I was really royally titled, and that alone. Thank you so much, I didn't buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it in the local pound store. You would have thought it would have given me an idea that the movie was a full-blown movie, but to be honest, I think Â£ 1 was too much money to spend on this movie !! What a great waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean wish I wish it was less painful than watching this movie !!!!
