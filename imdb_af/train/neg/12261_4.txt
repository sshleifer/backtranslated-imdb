Standard "paint-for-numbers" sample card, filled with a lot of routine plot-size graphics. It is as if someone had a short ticket with ideas of other movies written on them that were moved and treated. What plotted lines and characters in the deal was then thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> Characters are clicked so that you can play a game of "Guess who end up as a monster meal" in less than ten minutes in the movie, and probably each get one right - including the order which will devour them. Many of the characters are so diligent that you root the creatures to close them. Some of the main characters include: A Billy Idol clone that sharks with a shark, a hard-hearted brat that bankrolls, a Capt. Ahab man with a vendetta, and Ahab's girlfriend beating crazy dance at a bar. Oh, and a big, big animal that needs rage management. <br /> <br /> Along the way people plead many, pretty girls running around with wet t-shirts, couples making exotic beaches, explosions happening, ruins of a sanctuary appearing, and greasy-faced pirates falling through. <br /> <br /> Amusing, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the reassurance of characters when others were killed. After a violent demise, they make one-liner jokes. I can almost hear skulls. <br /> <br /> Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes to waste, and you want to laugh at a bad-it-good movie. Otherwise you can hit this one.
