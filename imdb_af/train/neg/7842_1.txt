Captured this by accident show - and could hardly believe how terribly the whole experience was. For comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was game binding because it kept man's interest in the whole time. But this piece of nonsense - words failed me. It was bad enough to propose a "story" that had all the impact of a wet bread, but the error was compounded by the obvious lack of captions by the so-called Sioux. For the sake of well-being, filmmakers cannot find enough North American Indians, who were also actors and actors to play as "Indians" in this farrago, instead of the fraudsters they actually used? I also found it scary to watch Richard Harris look around the countryside, on the obvious desire of the director just behind the camera and say he has to go from pointless point A to pointless point B Jump and jump to make only movie material and minutes. Totally horrible in all respects!
