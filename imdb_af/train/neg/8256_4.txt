The only word I can think of to describe this movie is: Simple. <br /> <br /> The plot line about Gary Sinise's character who commits suicide is a ridiculous point of departure and I'll be like a kind of Saleric hermit or progeny. in a hut golf balls are in the ocean because he couldn't handle life in the profitable golf community? weep a river for me. I wish these were my problems. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was obviously a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise. The scene in which Little Timmy Price is verbally abused by the other club member before his father during the tournament is so overwhelmed that I am ashamed to see it
