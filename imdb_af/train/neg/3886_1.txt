Is this a silly movie? You bet !! I couldn't find a moment in this movie, it was creepy or scary. Stupid moments? Very. Stupid characters? You bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker can do bigger and better things, it's not one of them. Oh well, people have to start somewhere. Dr Ted Nelson is cheese. He's the nicest doctor I've ever seen. He has a melting man running somewhere in the Ventura district, he is not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 kg) and there is no cartilage found anywhere. Plus he has the non-helpful general about his obstacle to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, although Mr Nelson can't tell him anything. There are also some random characters that are well thrown in, which the meltman meets. Eventually the movie ends and monster is overturned in a trash to become compost. In the end it's just what you need for a great MST episode.
