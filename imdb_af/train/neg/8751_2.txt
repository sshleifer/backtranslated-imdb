How Disney Can You Get? Preppy rich girls act like idiots, buy a lot of stuff, and learn a lesson. Is Disney sending a lesson to himself? Maybe it may still be human if it all buys? Whatever the psycho-analysis, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> The girls want a rich party for their rich life. But then money disappears and they have to use their wealth to get the dairy plant (yes, milk) to employ the workers. They watch it until Dad comes home. And the man at the beginning, who apparently is the one who takes the money, is the one. But the end is stupid. Webcam in Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time again. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "D"
