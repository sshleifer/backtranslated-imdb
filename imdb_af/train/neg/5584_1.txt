Do we really need more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I'm a Boomer, though when all the "idealistic youths" of the 60's read Marx, they burned their concept maps and generally extended a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives. I was still in graduate school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> It's just another exercise in the self-interest of kids who never really grew up.
