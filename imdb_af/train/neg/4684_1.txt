This movie is an insult to ALL submarines. It was stupid. It seems to be written by monkeys. The acting was absurd. If this is the view most people have of the fleet, then I cry for our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it under "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" as far as submarine films go. Gene Hackman really needed money to do this crap. Denzel Washington had to be high. Few in the plot make sense. And the end. For a military to be rewarded for its crime? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you haven't figured it out yet, I didn't like it. And if not for all the comments, I wouldn't have bothered to post.
