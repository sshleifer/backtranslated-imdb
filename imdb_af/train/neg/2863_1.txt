I was happy to watch this movie for free as I work in the hotel industry and this movie has been coming to our movie library lately. Nothing against low budget films, but this movie has horrible acting and directing. How can a movie like this ever be made. The director must be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors it is certainly not a springboard in a career. Please make sure you don't watch this movie, the play is lame, the camera and it is terribly direct. There are just a few more movies out there that deserve to be called the "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case I would see another 10 (or at least once).
