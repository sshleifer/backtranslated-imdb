Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-movie <br /> <br /> Events shocked to be shocking like people aboard an alien ship were boring and lame. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to see them since I liked the genre, but it sucked so badly. <br /> <br /> Now there are really very few good movies on the ALIEN topic, I think because most of them are low budget <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
