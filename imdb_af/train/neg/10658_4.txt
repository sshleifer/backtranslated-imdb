On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (thoughts, three of our hard Kamal fans) have reached a unanimous verdict; VV was crazy for a long time, and thanks to the film we had a nice mess on Monday. Not to mention, we swore to stay off the theaters the next year. <br /> <br /> I won't blame Kamal here because he has a tip in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something, "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri-play, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and editing, but we almost have Improve, when it comes to screenplay, direction and action.) While watching VV, the words are very true. <br /> <br /> Now, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br / > <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I barely use explorers here, but fact is HJ mastery sound to screw every recent movie of his (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the cacophony, he counts as background music.The next time I have a thrombosis transplant. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs The songs also do not help to move the film's narrative spatially / temporarily, nor do they put you on the foot and notice, the film feels that it is made from four very long songs t a few scenes n between them. <br /> <br /> 5. A short way too far. VV at its best is fit to be a short story, not a 2 hour plus thriller. Using a clich√© here, like the Energizer bunny, goes on and on; just in this case you don't want to. The later part of a movie feels like a big drag. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika Link Two ice cubes merged can make more sparks than this leadership. There is no reason for you to root them to make it together. In fact, every time they get together in the second half of the movie, they make a good annoyance for the narrative. Hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukerjee's 10 minute romance does more than reach Kamal and Jothika in this movie plus 'Thenali'. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan's accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that no one speaks in India or in the US; and it's not new either. He did this since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It simply becomes nerve. Imagine what devastation it can cause if its flair to use this strange accent meets on fire in place in the US. He also does not leave it at immigration, he offers dozens of advice to his men (confused TN Cops from Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in chaste Kamanglish ("What we are here is a bad police wok"), of course with deceptive effect. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some directors you expect to stand on a certain scale. Gautam neglects us badly with a little performance in the Department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses will meet his love interests on the streets to discuss such matters like himself and life afterwards! The scene in the theater was so bad, against the climax; we could hear people behind us, aloud the hero's IQ. "Is he stupid, can't he just use his siren or lights?" (On a busy Madras road, Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police Jeep, a man on a bike is chasing like any ordinary man!). "Can't he just use his gun?" ("The man on a bike" starts on foot and we have been adapting Kamal for quite some time). I don't agree with the later, but I'm just trying to explain the mood. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted women to be raped, their throats cut, more women raped and thrown into the bushes with indifferent authenticity, I would sit at home and rather a See "Police Report" or "Kuttram". The use of excessive force must go some way to expanding the story, not overwhelming it! Somewhere in the row, Gautum looks confused about what the extensions (rapes, murders) are and what the mainstay is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot Espresso couldn't get the headache.
