This is an unfortunate story story. It's about an hour in the movie before we have much idea of ​​what it's about. the characters often stumble inaudible; actions often seem to be unrelated; nobody looks worried about who the girl actually killed; A few eager children go swimming in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman is not faced with one of his friends because there is no obvious reason. To continue, will be as boring as the movie itself. The only semi-entertaining element is the landscape photography; but anyone can show a camera at Australian offshore, a memorable shot. Overall - foolish, incoherent, pretentious - and irritatingly wasting much of the viewer's time.
