Like others said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate title or response to this movie. For entertainment, the great opera singer must continue to sing. Not that he's a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, as it was, but afterwards it's nothing but a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> A singer, Pavarotti, as well as Giorgio Fini, plays his voice several times and the doctor, Pamela Taylor (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls to the doctor, the doctor slowly falls to the singer, the two argue all the time and further and further. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning lily and is a nice man. It's Harrold that spoils things and after she's looked at her, I'm not surprised that she hasn't become a star. <br /> <br /> There is beautiful scenery in the movie to enjoy, good shots from San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and didn't remember much about the second half of it.
