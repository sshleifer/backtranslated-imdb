I never wanted to see this movie, then one day I looked for a joke to see how bad it was; My preconceptions have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> To begin, I would like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind the mask of women making it big in the city, but the only way women can make it big is by using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are no more whores. Are some less attractive girls not allowed to succeed? It's not the only right wing message from the movie, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge amounts of cash. A good example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even seen in this film. Money is portrayed as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The bar manager says she doesn't allow drug users in her bar, and then goes to her poor drinks off her own neck and then the necks of her staff and clients. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicating things will know that liquor can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And lastly, why are scenes in which the main character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is dressed up or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch her pull her out with the camera that spoils her legs while she's one for her dad. She safe her father, just as she makes her boyfriend safe. I find this very strange. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is immoral, fascist, humiliating to women and honest, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
