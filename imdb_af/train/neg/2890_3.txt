The past crawls on a rehab addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and an earlier friend, after what he hopes, his last stint was in detox. "Life's dramas", represented here in the most simplistic way (not even the writing has any bites or whites). The film is made up of attractive looking actors who smile brilliantly at each other, and the music and photography are lugubrious (some of the visual effects are laughing, indie-clich√© is the hit of a naughty budget). Though written and directed by a man, it was produced by a woman, and I am not sure, but I think it could be a clear reason why this photo touches two men, estranged brothers closer to each other, never feel completely gels, natural or apparently alive. It's an attempt to get into a male relationship, but the cautious, sterile presentation is a scam. No one's heart is in this life, breathing or bleeding from this material. The "perfect sun" is quickly distributed by too many cooks in the kitchen.
