From the blocky digitized footage to the play that Keanu makes, "I'm so wooded, I can be a plank." Reeves looks like an Oscar winner, this movie bite (pun is not meant). The best thing about this is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which looks like the three are the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'spin'). Wish I spent the Â£ 3.99. It cost me something else, like sleeve .... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy it, you really are in a disappointment, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateur and with actors who are more wood than a 2x4, then continue. But if you want, quality wolf wolf action will be elsewhere, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt.
