I read half the dozen other user comments on this board and it seems the opinions vary widely. I have to agree with those who found this movie to be terrible. It hurts me to write it because I would have hoped it would have been good, or I wouldn't have bothered to see the other day. I like supporting indie theaters, especially if they are gay themes, but this movie is almost too much to bear. Those who went out, as I was considering after three minutes, probably didn't care to spend $ 11.00, or just thought it was going nowhere, and wouldn't improve. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they are. Whether it's or they didn't pay to go in the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He is a clothe. He's gay. I'm okay with that. The problem is that, because the main character is bored in a movie, it doesn't necessarily mean that the movie should be boring too! There are endless scenes of this child, just like a load of laundry, restoring everything you've already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., Etc. Nothing or nobody goes nowhere. No one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. Probably the most terrible of all is that I didn't feel the least part of Logan's empathy. This in itself is a great achievement. He did not grow, he did not change, he did not learn (there is no one to teach him), he did nothing and neither did the movie! Scene to the scene of the same thing does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title doesn't make sense at all. 10/01.
