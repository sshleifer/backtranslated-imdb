This movie looks like it's made for TV. For years I was waiting for a movie about Rubin Carter, because I loved seeing him at the old MSG and seeing this movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but he was terrible and boring There is really nothing good to say about this movie, except I kept the song.
