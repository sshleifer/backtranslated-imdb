Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Cemetery) and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this great talent mix you would think this movie would have been a real gore fix. It can't be any further. Massacre falls straight to his face as one of the most boring slasher movies I've seen comes from Italian theater. I actually struggled to stay awake during the film and I never had that problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> Massacre begins with a hook that is slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in Fulci's Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene, and it increases your expectations of the movie as a compelling blow. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie is so boring. The movie continues on a series of a horror movie being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes, but the characters in the movie are so boring and poor. Your interest begins to leak. The last 30 minutes of the movie is not that bad, but could have been much better. The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most gore scenes in Nightmare concert, there was nothing new. The end of the movie had a nice turn, but there was still too much unanswered and the continuity fell right through the floor. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a very good movie, but for a true Italian horror freak like me this movie is a must have as it's very rare. 4/10 stars
