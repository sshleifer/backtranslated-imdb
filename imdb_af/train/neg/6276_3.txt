THE BROKEN is part of the After Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or full gore. A lot of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist, Gina McVay (Lena Headly), is a strange world as her life seems to be out of control. While attending her father's (Richard Jenkins) birthday party, guests are amazed if a mirror falls to the floor for no apparent reason. Things get really weird when she sees a woman who is the spitting image of herself driving a London street in a car that is identical to her. Gina sneaks to her doppelganger's apartment and finds a picture of herself with her dad. She drifts away and is involved in a collision. Then my boyfriend was not the same; To be precise, family and friends are not easy for her to trust. Is Gina next to herself? Is she in a parallel world? Her nightmares become more terrible ... is she broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos if you can find this one ... it won't be easy. Editing can't be tighter. Lighting is doubtful. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
