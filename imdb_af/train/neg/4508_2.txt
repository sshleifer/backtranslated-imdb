Andrewjlau, I couldn't agree anymore. My girlfriend is watching this moment and I find this movie scary. Quote from my Chinese girl, laughing, "They're doing it all for a man!" <br /> <br /> I find these women have no intensity, no sense of the struggle between tragedy and identity, and that these men are probably not worth fighting. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi conquered them, the men looked stupid more than admired. Japanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people and geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese have something similar, but the faces don't match. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is so unmistakable, so American. If a European did it with European orientations, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I should add: most people who like the movie seem American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. Everything spelled out for you, not instinctively, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are nice, but I couldn't say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, cinematography is wonderful, but really, I can't see how it can be seen, these characters are complex, deep individuals. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the right thing. I'm sure it will be great to see.
