The movie had a nice opening, I really believed I was in for one of the best romantic comedies I've seen for a while ... there was something extraordinary "strange about the way the movie was set up, realistic, but somewhat abstract and mystical. But then the story line started to become more and more unrealistic. To say that the end was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an understatement. The most typical romantic end where everything goes well for every similar character. A scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and chases the "wife of his dreams" just to confess his love for her before a sympathetic crowd of viewers. Come on. In the end, the "good guys" win, "bad guys" leave ... You get the picture. A WASTE OF A POTENTIALLY INTERESTING MOVIE.
