An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken in the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires someone to go and brings her back. Complementing everything is the cannibals in the jungle that worship a very ugly "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> It's a greedy, messy movie. There are huge amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It is a mining film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the film wasn't so boring, it would be a classic movie. Let's face, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster, this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all down and it puts you out. There are several plot lines that all appear separately from each other, even though it is ultimately one story. Worst of all, almost no one says nothing. Most of the minimal dialogue concerns the cruelty or one character protest that "I'll do what I want". It's such a quiet and dull movie that if it's not for victims, I'd recommend it as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep or unless you have to watch every Euro cannibal movie. <br /> <br /> (An exception. VideoAsia just released it as part of their Terror Tales series. Their pressure is funny boxing that looks like taking their print from a Japanese source (there is failure) that was cut to remove the captions, and they do not print any opening titles.
