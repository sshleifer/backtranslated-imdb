I enjoy western movies, but this movie takes the cookie. The writing and dialogue are laughing. The acting was terrible, where did they get them? Music was OK I must say. Fortunately, I didn't buy or rent the movie, but it's now done. <br /> <br /> Initially I was ready when the stranger (martin sheen) started telling his story. I have to admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong Tex's finger shot and told him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But that's when everything then became pearly. I had to watch the whole movie hoping it would get better, never done it.
