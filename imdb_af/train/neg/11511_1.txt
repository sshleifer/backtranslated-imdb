I had the (wrong) fortune to see this movie at a show in the US. Having been restrained by the awkward thing, I'm shocked to see so many good reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fit in that early seventies, after the 1969 revolution thing; This movie just stinks of ......., well, nothing really. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a bad perfume commercial - see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna can never act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse with each of those years, and is becoming increasingly like a meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, can never be - his films are shallow, cut, fashion shows. He didn't disappoint either; He shows his wife wisely as the star of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Dear people, note the good reviews this movie of other posters received below. They are, of course, business plants. <br /> <br /> Don't encourage Ritchie to humiliate him by giving him money. <br /> <br />
