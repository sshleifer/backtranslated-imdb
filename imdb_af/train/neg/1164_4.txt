I don't know where to start, so I start with an extract from the back of the movie. "Alive combines the excitement of Vincenzo Natali's Cube with Kitamura's own Versus." I didn't see Versus, so I can't comment, but I think Cube was an excellent movie I recommend to everyone. But in this case, someone clearly "confused" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I'm just going on and spoiling the whole plot because, apart from being one holy Swiss cheese of a plot, it's also cheesy cheese, and the movie isn't worth any time don't spend even if you don't even know the plot. It does not matter. If I misunderstood the plot, don't hit me - it's probably because I had to struggle to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> So the American army in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Nambi desert. It seems to be because they are so sure of both deserts, they are almost the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired a stranger transferred to a Japanese researcher who had to survive the monkey to survive in the desert. What ever. The alien thing is now being passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so they decide to pass it from the current host (the researcher's daughter) to another man. But instead of just picking someone from the army full of people who are bloodthirsty and already on the military side, they decide it is probably a good idea to rather choose a criminal from the deadly row. Oh, and the reason they choose this particular criminal from the dead is because he was the first person in history not to die of the non-lethal electric shock that is the standard execution method, because everyone dies of the placebo effect. when they get electrocute. . I don't know if they do that, so they can giggle in the staff room, how everyone dies, though it's not deadly, or if they just want to cut off the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then the movie turned into what the matrix would have been if it were really crippled, and redundant battles lead us to tears for what feels like an hour. And oh wait, now they remember that they already had a man who was infected with the alien thing, so the whole movie up to this point was actually a total waste of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie where I didn't want to stay away and rather eat or eat a sandwich was when a man was tied to a wall by a pipe through his chest, and he hang around and another one step along. The man hanging on the wall says, "I have pain, shoot me". And the living man looks at him, and it's not like he's an average man or something, so he really looks sad and doesn't want the man to suffer on the wall. So he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (Rhetorical pause.) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Thank you a FREAKIN" HEAP. "
