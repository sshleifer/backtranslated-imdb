I wanted to see this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it down. Characters don't look like anything. Consider it: Heath Ledger walks a night (through a cemetery I believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. Once past this ordeal, he walked away quietly and met a friend who saw it all. When asked what happened, he said softly "attacked by demons, nothing serious." As if it were just a little more exciting than a flat band. <br /> <br /> I stop it when they ask something - a demon or something, I have stopped caring - a matter of ion. The answer can only be hired from someone with the energy of their death, and the priest looks at what vague annoyance appears when a man gets up and hangs and they ask his thirsty, dying body question. <br /> <br /> 0 from **** stars.
