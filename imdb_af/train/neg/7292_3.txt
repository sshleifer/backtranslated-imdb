Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, this is the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family began a humble start, then prospered, grew up mobile, changed its name and hoped to assimilate into Hungarian society so that successive generations could professionally promote. The story is told by the eyes of the eldest son in every three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WW II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein's life approach doesn't work well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is an artistic success, but missed an opportunity. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; This is enhanced by voice and news line art. The family's plot comes from a predictable event [ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and key sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could give the family's character and credibility are up to the end. Alternatively, filmmakers offer generation continuity based on common themes of incest / infidelity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes shows flashes of brilliance, but his performance is far from award-winning material. The "3 for 1" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian "History Channel" material. It moderated the appearance of Winds of War that was messed with Forrest Gump with a little about sex. <br /> <br />
