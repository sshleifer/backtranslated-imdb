No doubt, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor, but also a talented singer. After all, very few actors nowadays can only get a scene, and that was pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on set. <br /> <br /> As the 1960s felt, the quality of the man's films really started to drink. The Tony Rome detective series was nothing more than competing with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series, which came out simultaneously. Maybe even a James Bond competition, but nothing really worked for France in France. His personal life in shambles, his music disappears ... Sinatra appears more like a setback after the 1950s. The last big Sinatra movie of this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
