ba ba ba boring ...... it is next to the battlefield earth in science fiction slumber. genius francis (a general hospital laura) has a small role as a reporter and it must in itself tell you that this movie should be bad. There is Ben Kingsley (an academic award actor) in this stinker and some other decent actors. You have to wonder what they have to decide to do this horrible movie. The music goes up and down dramatically, as it is a great dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are also moderate and look really dated. All the actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism for their dialogue. I can go on with how it is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth, it's so bad, it's funny, but it's just b. Avoid if you don't want to sleep.
