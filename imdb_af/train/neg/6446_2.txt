Western society had ideas about India as a poor country. Movies like this only make those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it more difficult for Indians to be accepted overseas. It has been agreed that India is poor and homeless, but why there is no representation of educated people, if not the successful ones. <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​the movie Patrick Swayze depicts as another Mother Teressa. In my opinion, this movie has shown India in a very bad light that gives false concepts. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly why people ask me: "If we go to India, we can rent an elephant right outside the airport so we don't have to walk so full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on current Indian society should look "Monsoon Wedding".
