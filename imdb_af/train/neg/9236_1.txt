I am among millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans, but I can't think of any reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the decisive Betsy Drake and it seems as if no one else did if we judged from the small number of films in which she played. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great at getting Cary Grant in the baby care room. The director or authors try the idea, but it fails. I read comments about how "creepy" Drake was, but I thought it was too soft a description. Franchot Tone walked through this one as if he were hungover. A casting disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This one does not earn 10 lines of comment and I do not know why it is a requirement. Badly this one is preserved when so much trouble films in the safe rotting. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give this one a wide cab.
