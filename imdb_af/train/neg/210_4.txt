Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many original early Hip Hop artists, but they apparently made it clear that it could be their big break, of course for some it was and it's nice. But if you see it as original Hip Hop Culture, you're wrong. These are ear products and have a Hollywood sauce. Rather look at the first two movies I mentioned. They conveyed the greed that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but reviews are mostly positive or even brilliant. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogue and the direction are all terrible, the music and dance are what the people like about it. I like the dance, but at the time I thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy as '86 'a new generation of classic hip hop artists, such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers , Bizmarkie to name a few), and I still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that's why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style doesn't have much of a story, but the music is big and authentic. Of course the taste differs and it is good. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is uneasy except for the break dance and some of the music and so I can't rate it higher than 4 out of ten.
