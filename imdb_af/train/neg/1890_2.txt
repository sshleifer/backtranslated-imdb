The problem I find with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie. A blend of the two genres just doesn't work and it's all hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is more so because the director is selected the extreme aspects of what is supposed to happen in our everyday life, making it an unconvincing documentary. If it's a thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In what case, what is the moral or message the director is trying to convey to the audience? That around us are people who treat others who have been badly treated? That there are many crazy lunatics around us? So .......... so what?
