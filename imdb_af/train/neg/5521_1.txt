I just watched this movie and decided to see what others thought of it. I wonder if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it doesn't succeed. The writing is very poor - the plot has so many holes that it will make a good diving net for the fishing tones. The characters were not well-developed and the storyline so jumping around that I questioned myself: "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen during the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry among the role players. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's fraud during filming. It was pretty clear that everybody came up and did their job but did not devote their roles. <br /> <br /> It's not a worthwhile movie ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice bath and save your money for something worthwhile!
