As a veteran of many, very pretentious French films, I thought I would have taken the worst of the industry and could stomach anything. But not that. Pointless, relentless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression that is adapted as predictive art. Avoid at all costs.
