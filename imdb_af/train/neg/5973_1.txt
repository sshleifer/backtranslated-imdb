This movie is another great example of what Jerry Bruckheimer has been looking for since 1997 to make a movie a year before his release and not to come up with a quality film. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they came. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a moment, and an avid attempt to make a love story were exactly what I predicted in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.
