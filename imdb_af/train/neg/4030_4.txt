I remember looking at a lost missile (I actually put a fit to my brother and several cousins ​​at home whose home I was overnight to agree to watch with me - I was from time to time The 1960s Eric Cartman - sorry, guys) and gets somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of the million-degree heat emerged as a plot device. Even as a second degree, I knew that a mere missile just didn't turn the energy on for so much heat or destruction over more than the lengthy and limited radius of a nuclear explosion. <br /> <br /> My supply of turkey to loving family members was a self-inflicted crime. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. The acting is not bad (except for the actor Shatnerism who played the governor's aide.) <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​a missile. Easily bake the surface of the earth through the heat of its outlet ... no. How did the people at "Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss "The Lost Missile" anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want to drink beer after a weekend.
