Trust me, this is a movie you want to avoid and it comes from a great Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a BIG movie. The first part of this movie is an extraordinary task to set up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he has paid to protect. The trailers on this movie all call her kidnapped. So, I give nothing away when I say the movie degenerates to an almost immovable mess after she was kidnapped. What the director is trying to achieve, everything he manages to do, literally makes the audience nausea. Fast, winding and thin tracks follow for the next half hour as Creasy traces of the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and misleading that all they do is get you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story indicates a change in Creasy's character and suggests that another movie would follow. Well, he's right. The movie that followed was a complete and unsatisfactory crap. The result is a depressing end that even ruins the quality of the first forty minutes of the movie.
