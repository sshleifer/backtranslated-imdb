I love the munna bhai MBBS, but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life. And these high ratings really surprised me about what happened to the taste of Indian film experts? <br /> <br /> ** MAY SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs an advice from a Bhai, people who discuss their personal issues. on phones come on man from which part of the world you r ?? I agree that movies should be fictitious, but these things are really indefensible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars start well for 15 minutes)
