Wow. The only people who recommend it positively are the Carpenter Pharmacist. I know many of them. The guys who watch John Carpenter's knees on celluloid and pinch a movie and portray it as a horror masterpiece. This "movie" is utterly crap. It looks and sounds like a porn (good lord, the soundtrack is terrible ...), and has a shocking sub-par porn pattern because usually Ron Perlman is a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter thought when it was done. Probably, "Beans, Beans, Beans." Until someone fed him and made him roll in a blanket for the day ... They say nothing about the abortion debate, because they could have had a very interesting central theme. religious zeal anti-abortionists feel when it is the devil's baby), but instead they chose to kill Ron Perlman and his terrible children, kill a lot of people and the terrifying doctors try to kill the hysterically poor pregnant girl to calm down. Not a single person from this episode or what you have to get away unharmed. It's just terrible. Like, Plan 9 Out of Outside, terrible. Like, good God, please turn someone off before I make myself terribly dirty. Try to look at it and the thing on the same day and intervene.
