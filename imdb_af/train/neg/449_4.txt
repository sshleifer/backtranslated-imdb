I will admit that I've only watched a handful of episodes, but each one looks completely different from the following. It seems after the first season that the producers have decided to completely divert the show, drop characters, re-launch and rewrite the entire program dynamics. As you probably suspect, the performance is particularly strange. , unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes) moving in with New York City's high-ranking sister Valerie (Jennie Garth). Good enough starting point: strange couple + fish from water + high jinx. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while I miss the sitcoms of yore, this show misses the point at funny repeatedly, and it's sad because they have proper talent. <br /> <br /> Beyond everything, they insisted on changing the show. (Val was with a regular game during one season, then he was suddenly gone, so she opens a bakery? It drastically, you get the feeling that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets , characters written off and new shows regularly! <br /> <br /> On a side note (it's just nitpicking), I know it's a television program and not really, but Val and Holly finish in a BIG loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious?
