Well, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Wrudge. It's scary by just working freaky camera and having loud noises, but it fails. The plot, if you can call it, is poor and quite full of holes, how would the care center know that Yoko didn't turn up for work when the people living in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He just came out of nowhere to promote the plot. It didn't make much sense what had happened to the original family. Who was in the room, boy or dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care centerman found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it.
