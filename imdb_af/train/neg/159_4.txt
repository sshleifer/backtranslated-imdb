I always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life, as well as her talents as an actor. So I found it strange that she would appear in a movie that distorted the facts. Her character's rescue from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, who runs a Canadian design and building Twin Otter aircraft. The trip was switched off by the US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard as their capabilities. The same company had a similar rescue a few years later to bring a man out of the South Pole. I feel the film justified a very poignant subject and documented a very courageous woman who faced a frightening task. I fail to see why the producers consider it necessary, ignore the bravery of the rescue shed and show the rescue aircraft as a USAF Hercules.
