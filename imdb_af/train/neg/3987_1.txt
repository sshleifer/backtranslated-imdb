I ran out of very little movies before they ended, but I couldn't finish this piece of garbage. It was the largest load of racism that passed as a nation's birth as a legitimate film. The characters were little more than cardboard cuttings. I don't see how any actor wants their name associated with this movie. Lee must have better things to do that are so dirty. I know that anyone with a brain has better things to do .... like to look dry. I wish someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically. There is much more depth on this subject the level ranting of a bitter director like Lee.
