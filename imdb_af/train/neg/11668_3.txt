There are beautiful landscapes. Writers have mouth-watering trite mouthings. With less actors, this performance will be stupid. "Art must elevate or it is BS." Not so because art of all that is called also stirs humanity and expresses the dark side. The main character says even those who don't drink hide the shady side. Wrong, he lived in the darkness and suppressed his dark side by drinking and being one-dimensional and not expanding his horizons with anything other than landscapes. There was no respiratory organism in his work or expression of his pain. All the artist limited him to a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters were a graduate school, but it always gave the one character the writer wanted. I tried to enjoy it after reading the first wow comment here. I had to dig deep to see those with whom I agreed. I find the big comment was from those who are linked to the movie. I was just moved to the end once. The child was too passive. The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. Just my opinion, but nowhere to show me.
