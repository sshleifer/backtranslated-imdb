I must say I'm really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets 'visions' when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched on twice continued her face ... Just as ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible which I thought. She was very annoying. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so most of the supporting role players played for what they had to do. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and am very open-minded when it comes to movies, but this movie It seems like I have been a ridiculous plot and top-notch and it just wasn't for me.
