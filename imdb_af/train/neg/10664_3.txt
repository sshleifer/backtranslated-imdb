A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battle his former employers for some gizmo this non-heroes plan to sell to "the Iranians." Low-rent video nonsense by manufacturers of "Silk Stalkings" offers some decent action footage and a very inactive "drama" ... a lack of logic and really terrible dialogue are the key issues, although the final twist and fidelity shifts could be a good end to a better movie. Burt is still present, but it also means that you are more aware of giving an infinite half bakkie with an abusive mouth.
