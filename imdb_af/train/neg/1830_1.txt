It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not joking. The next time it goes on, I'm just going to run my head in a wall. It would be more enjoyable for me to sit in an emergency room to explain to a doctor why my brain was swollen than to make it through this movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope black and quiet never work together a bad project. they are both good comedians, so I was shocked it was so uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> If they had to do it all again, I'm pretty sure they'd decide not to. The people who fed the money must have lost a ton. Not really, because the special effects (all 2 of them) were terrible.
