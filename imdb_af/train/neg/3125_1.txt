Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old note who lives with some servants in Morhenge Mansion and tells his doctor friend, "Don't doctor my doctor's doctor! I'm disgustingly healthy!" He invites his cousins ​​and nephews to his house and warns them that they can inherit a genetic disease that causes the madness of the brain to shrink (?) <br /> *** *** SPOILERS *** <br / > <br /> Morteval / Karloff ends dying, and murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) start killing the family. A mini-cannon makes real dots in a guy's face, a life-size knight in ax weapons and a dancing sheikh stab people with a knife. One man strangled makes some hilarious faces. In the end, Julissa and her boyfriend Karloff still live and hide in the dungeon where steel gates seal the room. He plays the recurring organ theme music (such as a death rattle used for the murders), begins to speak to the brother's spirit ("The whole house goes with me!") And the house goes up in flames. <br /> <br /> This senseless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never fits the lips.
