Any time a movie is, is so myopic in its desire to present a particular endpoint or point of view that simply doesn't bother with a real story, it's annoying. These are the types of movies where the end point or point of view is first invented, and the story is simply tackled. For this reason, we often speak of the story of "jumping through hoops" as it turns, trying in vain to proceed to the predetermined end in a logical manner. <br /> <br /> Doing the story in "Comet Over Broadway" Don't just jump through hoops, it's a three-circus. It's so ridiculous, so poor, so ominous that, if you tend to speak aloud on the screen, you'll be quite a rant before it's gone. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this cesspool script is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Being so horrified, it would be offensive to anyone of any opinion. In the end there is no talk of the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor scenes, the play is not a thing.
