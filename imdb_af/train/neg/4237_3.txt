JUDAAI was a fat film by Raj Kanwar at his time. In 1997, such a topic was condemned from the box. <br /> <br /> To give him his credit, he manages to show how greed a person changes and to what extent the person can get what she wants <br /> <br /> The movie is However, damn melodramatic, many places ridiculous. <br /> <br /> One wonders why Anil doesn't buy a TV for his wife? when he earns so much, just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The turn is well handled, but handling is straight out of the 80's The Johny-Paresh comedy that comes out here and stands out as a sore thumb As it doesn't fit in the story < br /> <br /> Even there are several cringeworthy scenes <br /> <br /> Direction by Raj Kanwar is sufficient though it is too melodramatic. Music is good, but most songs seem to be forced <br /> <br /> Anil's part is good Sridevi is excellent in her part. Urmila is decent. Under the Frame Khan is as usual. Johny. The army is funny. Paresh irritates Farida is decent.
