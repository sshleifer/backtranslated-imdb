It's hard to say whether Noonan and Marshall are trying to monkey Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry, or any other comedy team, but whoever tries to imitate them has failed. There is hardly a bad laugh in this whole amazing stupid picture. Noonan (who helped to write the alleged "script") and Marshall has no chemistry whatsoever; Marshall seems to be a Dean Martin-type devil-power-care cool, but he doesn't even get close. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but it was funny, sure. He looks as though he thinks his arms and legs are very folded and stupid and everything is the height of the screen comedy; Maybe it's for him, but not for the audience. I remember it in the theaters when it came out. It was at the bottom of a double account with a three-year-old Jeff Chandler Western ("Pillars of the Sky", which was pretty good) and a Three Stooges short ("Sappy Bullfighters"). About 20 minutes into this thing, all the children in the audience were throwing things on the screen; It was so staggering that it didn't even measure the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stayed for the end (not what I wanted, but my people didn't intend to pick me up until the movie ended) and by the time this mess was over, I was the only one in the theater. . I saw it on the cable about 15 or so years ago, one night and held to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing it was going to be was Julie Newmar, who was smoke-free as always. Except her, this thing has absolutely nothing to recommend it. The two of them also play Japanese soldiers, and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis's notorious game of Japanese characters as thick-lensed, buck-teethed, gibbering mental defects look cheap compared. Marshall also hosted "Hollywood Squares" and Noonan tried his hand at making movies, but most of them were almost as bad as that. Not really, because I don't think anything can be that bad. A true pathetic waste of film. Don't waste your time.
