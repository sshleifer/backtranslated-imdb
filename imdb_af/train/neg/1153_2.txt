Disappointing and annoying. The scriptwriter does not have a true understanding of human nature, but instead clich√©s cut in unprecedented ways. Character is not thoroughly investigated. These are dolls that have been plotted in a plot that he has openly confessed to, has a dramatic element, the mother's relationship with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid gives an excellent performance despite a few strange situations and lines, which are passive to enable her daughter-in-law to spot her. The writing depicts Darren (Daniel Craig) as a Dr Jekyll / Mr. Hyde has no hints on why, except he hits cocaine in front of the big scene. <br /> <br /> An adult author could have done so much more with this topic.
