Ariauna Albright is a very good actress, but why she participated in this lame written transvesty is a mystery. What could have been entertaining winds as classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act and look really sexy as opposed to her friend, Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but it is clear that she spends the money for theater at the spa or beautician. It was a production that screamed for some T&A. With an imaginative writer it could be achieved in the flow of things. But Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances and to some extent save her reputation. The Tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in shady fetish copuniforms, the viewers will play some fetish and T & A. Nough says.
