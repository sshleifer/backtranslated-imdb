The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the movie is pretty good. Even directing it. The biggest problem is with the castings, which have the film in almost another local and regular clich√©, with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Besides the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressive by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the older Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but with no intensity as the lead. therefore the figure she acted to softened and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal, then a real movie. But it is a good point to start and make big improvements in the future.
