Boy, who was a dud this mess. But it only takes an hour and I just paid a buck for it so I would live .... unlike the whole cast of this 1933 clunker that's all the dust. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a small town with bodies drained from all their blood starts. Of course, the local jukle starts talking about vampires, and a little more hard after each body is found. The villager or constable or whatever he is played by the incredible actor Melvyn Douglas tries to tell them differently. When he mentions the fact that the dead have one big hole on each side of the neck, instead of two holes close to each other, the residents simply say it's a huge vampire bat. The constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit who does the murder. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn doesn't look too bothered. He spends most of his time trying to play in the pants of his sweet, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix, the town is simply played by Dwight Frye, who all looked like he played the same role in every movie he did. He mocked the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood. Leonie Atwill plays the village doctor who is apparently trying to help the constable solve the crimes. And the boy does he ever stink as an actor. The will is so close to cardboard in this role he can get. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing. Many big names are such a stack of guano. <br /> Unlike the horrible mistletoe this movie has, the alternative name, "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this movie is also boring and plowing and just stupid. <br /> <br /> For me, the high point of the movie is looking at Frye, he nails the freaky town weirdo but others like him didn't offer this movie much. And then if you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect that all this blood needs, you'll really have to lower me. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi did a lot of awesome pictures, but at least he was fun and interesting to watch. Think of this movie as a very bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you will get a feel for how unfortunate it was. <br /> <br /> If you can't make a good 1930 horror movie, you're at least Lugosi in It.
