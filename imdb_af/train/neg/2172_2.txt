Bottom of the walk, unimaginable, and virtually uncompromising remake of the road war. This movie follows the exact plot as the Filipino movie STRONG and is far worse! Bad acting, dialogue, effects, dubbing, pacing, action ranges ... The list goes on and on. Italy has literally made dozens of Road Warrior rip-offs in the early 80's, some good, some bad. It's the worst, no match. Not only was the mood of the movie completely dark and miserable, the experience of sitting through this one is a drill and a half. There was 1 (one) good sequel to the start of the movie, and a cool shot from a man who exploded a hand grenade. But everything else about this movie serious series! For the real post-nude fun, get a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE NEW YORK FALL, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead. They are much nicer than this litter.
