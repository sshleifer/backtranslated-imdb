Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this movie in the Edinburgh movie festival. It was shot well from the beginning, but these are the last positive comments I have about the movie. The acting was terrible, I wonder if the real gogo girls were hired? But it was the plot that was really feasible because it was nice and not boring, the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention some of the screens that the audience really laughs at. <br /> <br /> The girl in the field moves: Who would have thought a kid kicking another child can act so badly. An own eye sensor. <br /> <br /> Getting on the bus scene: The girl comes on the bus. But according to the music the world ends. <br /> <br /> The rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this one really shows the plotwriter's skills. In the room, followed by raw meat and skill sales. Why doesn't she just get to perform all three sins simultaneously? At least then the movie could have been slightly shorter. <br /> <br /> Running from the mall's stairs: watch as one of the girls walks down the stairs, followed by a meat that Dau eats and doesn't wait. She walks quickly and tries not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> Running in blood: it's definitely my favorite scene and an end to the movie. A half-marathon in red paint, completed by railing and over the bridge, is only sent to fly unrealistically by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is undertaken by the most self-obsessed girl in the film, and it is now up to you. <br /> <br /> I would like to think this movie was created by a 16 year old. old and their friends. Unfortunately, if you met the director at the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic mood and want to laugh with a few friends, don't do it yet. even think about it.
