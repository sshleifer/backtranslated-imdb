OK, the director reminds LOVE HONESTY Director Nikhil Advani after the debut with KHNH is doing his second half and waiting <br /> <br /> He loses a 3:30 hour + movie that is patience, time.etc. The viewer looks like a 3 hour sleep to watch this movie <br /> <br /> OK they had 6 stories so it was needed, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have convincingly, but boring, the Anil-Juhi story, not TV shows showing such stories? <br /> <br /> We have Govinda-Shannon's funny story and work well <br /> <br /> We have credible Akshaye-Ayesha story again, but soon become boring and the focus is on comedy more and that also a slapstick boring comedy. <br /> <br /> We have Salman-Priyanka story which is the worst, not just acting terms, it makes no sense <br /> <br /> We have Sohail-Isha story to make you laugh and the trick sometimes works, thanks to the boredom that most other stories put. <br /> <br /> We've got John-Vidya story a good story in every respect. <br /> <br /> By now, all the stories will come in pieces. The viewer is bored and sleepy. However, the climax is not attractive. Especially the highlight of Salman-Priyanka's story Nikhil Advani's handling is good in places, some stories are well handled but poor in places. Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs. Camera photography is nice, every story is given. another look, texture and it works <br /> <br /> Actors Govinda Rocks, after a resignation with BB, he actually laughs and loves him in this movie, despite his age and weight. Anil Kapoor maintains his share well, though he looks out of form and John admonishes in his part. Akshaye Khanna overworked for a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too over-the-top and Isha has nothing to do. Anjana Suknani has been fired <br /> <br /> Primaanka and Salman deserve an award for this movie, you are shocked? <br /> <br /> Not only does Salman Khan do, speak as if he were in his sleep and that false accent, oh God, Priyanka overworked to such a standard you feel about throwing something at her, she does better after the end. Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is good. Shannon is good.
