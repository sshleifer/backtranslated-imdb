Given the title and foreign boxing art, I was ready for anything. Maybe my expectation is just a little too high, because I left a little dry. <br /> <br /> A movie crew working on a soft-core sex movie ends at a strange home when they get lost in the mist and decide the best way to spend the night is to have sex. have. Where has this configuration not been used yet? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the generation. Not allowed to show all the goods (leaks were illegal in Japan for a long time, shown, are knocked out). The film tries as hard as it can to show the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <Between all the kinky goings, a mud monster (whose origin I can't understand) appears and the men start killing and raping the women ... also killing them. Some of the sights are a bit, especially a woman with gut that is pulled out of her vagina, or another woman who has a mouthful of ... stuff, but otherwise the gore is a nice standard money. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the film is drawn by its own designs; it's too exaggerated to be a horrible horror image and too horrible to work as a sex fly. The mediums can work, but there must be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
