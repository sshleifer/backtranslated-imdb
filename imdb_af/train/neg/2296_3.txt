"Back of Beyond" takes place at a dive dinner / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly comes in a difficult place when some visitors come unexpectedly . We find what seems confusing in the beginning like a look back in which he and his sister (although their relationship with each other later in the film is better understood) is driving through the desert on his motorcycle. Then he appears as a terribly quiet and sometimes moody character in the presence of the arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know one thing is certain and it is McGregor's kind of spiritual sense, his prospect of danger and so - his clairvoyance is only slightly relevant to the story, most of which has three diamond tissues, who break his car and rely on Tom to help them out of the way without getting in the way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly it throws all three, who are already allies against each other. But not in a way that really leads to anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to be building too much, but really failing to do so. Even the end, which speaks like a sturdy campfire story (and one that really reveals many narrative errors), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pace, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little bit different from the usual.
