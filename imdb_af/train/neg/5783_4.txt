Oh, the sex-and-gore movie. It's too bad they don't make it anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out this way, it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie basically consists of the two beautiful vampires that "johns" pick up on a country road and take them to their castle home, have sex with them, and then eat them (except first victim, who cares for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman struggling with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she sees. It really gets ugly from here. By the end, the two vamps are in such a bloodlust that they eat everything in the face, and succeed in escaping their prisoner. Oops, so much for the secret. <br /> <br /> The fact that the two vampires don't care to take out their clothes and deceive them is the only thing this movie is about. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why is their grave so far from their castle?), Just watch the barely few minutes of vampire play. The only thing I got from this movie was these two valuable pieces of advice: shooting lesbians won't kill them; it will only change them into vampires, and will not pick up hookers on a country road; they are probably vampires. Other than that, it wasn't really worth my time.
