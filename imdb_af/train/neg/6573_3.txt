I read the reviews on this and while I didn't expect a saving private Ryan, I expected a movie of a substance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to be very lob-sided with the ordinary intro of history and how the unity has come about. But right away it's 1944 and you're not sure where everyone is. The accents, etc. Is very poor as this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian-American, but everyone speaks in a very poor record of Harvard's English imitation of a Japanese person. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I couldn't watch it anymore. The characters were 1-dimensional and although they were probably based on real people, I had no feeling for them and it didn't mind me. Very poor direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on a cable channel. I will avoid and look for better efforts. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, but it was better to tell better. You felt that the director had seen brothers band and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch band of brothers, Tuskegee pilots, Glory or any other movie like when trumpets fade ...
