PLAN B has the appearance of a fast-paced, uncontaminated, sloppy movie for a movie attempting an outing for the actors involved - an outing that had to be dismissed from the start. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is more concerned about crime and appearance than his business. It's just another Mafia-based 'comedy' that's nothing new and lowers the default for the contestants. <br /> <br /> of management. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is more stupid than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni hit one of his debtors (who is only married to financial years Fran-Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran as his assistant to work on her deadly husband's debt by being Maloni's "hit". Fran is scared of her own shadow and can't do Maloni's orders. Instead, she picks her "whackees" to Florida to hide from her brother James's house until she can find out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A to kill them! The end is completely predictable, just as every line in the script is assigned to the characters. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made many fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she shouts and jerks and pulls her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, indeed, the Paul Sorvino type played from other mobster movies. The supporting roller hole is also allowed to play on the balcony in the widest slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy eventually becomes stupid and redundant. Director Greg Yaitanes has to go back to TV sitcoms: if this thin story is compressed in half an hour, it may have had a chance. Grady Harp
