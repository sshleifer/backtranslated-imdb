Hopelessly unsafe and dull movie in which the characters stand in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly. You may think things will get worse if they explore Mars, but these scenes are filmed by a heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very dark. The Mars landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the samples are completely unconvincing. There are echoes of 'Bride Of The Monster' when the heroine gently eats the octopus like a tentacle of a meat plant around her before poor thrashing over, the difference being that the Ed Wood film is one hundred times more entertaining. Better wear earbuds if you see if the sci-fi music score, which is endlessly repeated, will make you foolish. If you can't sleep, just sleep this one in the video recorder and your sleeplessness won't be healed in any time.
