My goodness is this movie bad. I was completely deceived by my local film review because it is certified garbage. Yes, yes, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black .... and the good guys always win. Go home now and cut your kids and feel how good Hollywood made you feel. Sheet metal toys! I can't believe this brain-dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I guess he needs a little money to pay the bond, and he made this piece out of order. This is the kind of production that makes everyone who watches movies regularly believe that they can do as well or better than such an experienced director. <br /> <br /> Yes, a bad guy wants a lovely girl who loves her dad to do a little IL's bad thing or he'll hurt her dad. But for Mrs. All-American girl next door, we know she'll save the day and beat the bad guys ... the end. Girl Power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Now, just an idiot will find this entertaining ... "a rollercoaster ride," let alone something fresh or new. All the "super duper" benefit you see on this site is from the industry hacks that make money out of this movie, pay back a favor, or sell their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful .... Yes, that's it. Not a good thing, not a horrible thing ... she's just cute. She had to show a lot of skin to save this movie. She is not tough enough to be a good female action lead. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least acceptable in 28 days. But here he plays a stupid villain as if he's smart. He gets his ass kicked back and forth through the 5'5''McAdams, because she was a cheerleader ... and a hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Tires. . So she must be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist. I won't trust him to steal a gum from 7-11. <br /> <br /> Yes, look, this movie was done before, except before they did it well. Go again one of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones, international terrorists, except that the characters are more fun and credible and the bad guys are more competent and interesting. I just don't understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were unaware of the right models that they could easily copy. No wonder film revenue is off. <br /> <br /> Spend $ 6 in the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life, you'll never come back. <br /> <br /> Ciao, FreddyShoop
