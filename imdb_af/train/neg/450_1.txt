This show is painful to watch ... It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, the ever-changing work, boyfriends or role-players. They seem to want to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but didn't have an idea, and came with this crappy show. They throw her like a teenager, surrounded by twenty-one, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. Soon they realize they need a "click" and throw people in their late 20s to try to succeed as teenagers. <br /> <br /> How this show survived 4 seasons is over me. Somehow, ABC has now decided it is a "family" show, and cast it on ABC family in the afternoon style.
