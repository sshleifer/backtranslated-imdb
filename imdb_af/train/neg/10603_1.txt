I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I couldn't make it to the end. The first time I managed to get through the first battle series, and then I lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to digest over an hour's foamy scene, SFX and extremely poor direction. Palette compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Anyone ever heard of the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who didn't allow me to fill you in. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest cash-smashes of all time. Atari decides to put a movie-in-game on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and financially painful story, the game took a long time and thousands of thousands of Atari 2600 ET games dumped into landfills because they couldn't even give them away, don't let them sell. <br /> <br /> What does universal soldier do: returning to this story? Look at the 3.2 rating and determine it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Awful movie ... IMDb forced me to give it 1 out of 10 because their rating systems are not going to be as low as 0 in the negative.
