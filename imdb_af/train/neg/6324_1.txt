I have run eight years of movies in the 80's and 90's. It was by far the worst movie I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad is that it is airborne to try to be a wonderful, inspiring movie. Even the great Gregory Peck couldn't save this terrible piece of much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an early movie role, clearly showed that she had not yet learned to act (she is still trying, but it doesn't get much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear weapon devastation will never happen, just because it scares kids to play small league baseball! Even the performances on Nick and The Disney Channel aren't stupid enough to try and make us believe it's drunk. <br /> <br /> It's not worth wasting the time you watch on the cable TV. It's not worth the price of a movie rental; Your dollar will be better spent on an extra packet of microwave maize with the other movie you have chosen (because it can only be better than that).
