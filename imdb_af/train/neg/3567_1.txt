A family with father Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes), move to this beautiful Maine house - seemingly unaware of the roaring semis The 90-second highway in front of their home! The neighbor over the road (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets, but a little further is a sacred ground that can make the dead alive again ... but the dead come back in a nasty mood. "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** The novel by Stephen King was good - it was long but it developed characters and situations This movie gives ALL character development and only plays the gore and violence, killing animals on camera (I know it's fake, but it's still repulsive), a little boy hit by a semi and his chest appeared open during the funeral (in a totally ill tone l), he was brought back life and attacks and killed people including his mother (I wonder how a 3 year old hair could hang); A ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family without cause. The movie only works the audience about every horrible death or violence in your face. It's just his way of shocking you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Acting is no help. Midkiff is just as horrible as the father - he is handsome and dull, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. The two children are just irritating. Just Gwynne saves this picture neatly with his effortless good acting. <br /> <br /> This photo shows a total disdain for the audience taking big leaps in logic and characters doing amazing stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a big box office in 1989 which led to the even worse successor in 1992. I saw it in a theater and was disturbed how the audience was excited about the violence and was just terrified of what I saw. A sick repulsive horror movie. A 1 at all. <br /> <br /> If you think it's everywhere and can't get worse, the Ramones sing a title song !!!!!! ("I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Really out of faith.
