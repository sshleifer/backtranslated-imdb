I'll put it at the top of my list of movies in the incompatible trash category! There are movies that are bad, but the worst kind are those that are incompatible, but you have to keep them because they're supposed to be good for you! The sex series, which were so shocking in the day, couldn't even raise a rabbit. The so-called controversial politics is strict high school's closest amateur night-marxism. The movie is self-conscious in the worst sense of the term. Photography is in a hard grain black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art <br /> <br />
