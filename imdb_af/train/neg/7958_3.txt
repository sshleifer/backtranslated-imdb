Protest runs linearly; Don't expect any quick action, and you won't even breathe, as there's simply no seat at the moment. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a cross, so don't expect one too. I would not be guilty of the play - the show would have been very worst if it was not for Wu's acting, which was the only saving grace. And, oh that cute girl. <br /> <br /> The humor is at its best, poor, and the show should also be an anti-drug campaign that uses the usual shock tactics (especially in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us things we already have Know - Drug Breaking Families, Heroin Makes You Crazy, It's Not So Easy to Wipe, You'll Fall into a Crazy Cycle. <br /> <br /> I know it may look a bit hard, but I feel that the performance is far from seamless and somewhat immovable (* SPOILER ALERT *: For example, take Andy Lau to the police station: what do we have just said, "Oh, we've got all the ties and testimony against you since 1997," and THIS is how he's been caught. No, no chase-car action, just a leap from the scene, which played the role of Wu role as a shelter in the first place.) I suspect the lack of creativity is due to the fact that it is a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singapore production film company.
