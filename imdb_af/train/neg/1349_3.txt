I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and just decided to watch it yesterday. I don't know why it took me so long, like me like the Gadget Inspector and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. While it may have a bright color palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are a few old things that miss the gadget from the toilet. <br /> <br /> First of all the classic Inspector Gadget-themed song and music is completely absent. The composer is trying to compromise by making a similar look, but it's still just not good enough. The Gadget phone is now a talking car, not a car that can get in a bus. Plus it looks a lot louder and rounder instead of simply being cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain barely make a appearance. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. There's something about a transformation formula and Dr. Claw uses some that have never revealed evil, but that's all I have. What the deal with the short / giant Italian man was, I will never know. It has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is something to pass, its last case is by no means complicated. And he stays on the power so why it is also called "last case" is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> I wasn't impressed at all. This is detrimental to a large animated show that is absent on DVD, but don't allow you to buy any Inspector Gadget DVDs you can buy. I sold it a few seconds after I finally watched it. No child will appreciate or appreciate it and no fan of the old show will tolerate it.
