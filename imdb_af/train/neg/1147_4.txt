This movie is after the F.B.I. It's history as Knott's Berry Farm is to the old west. Shamelessly disinfected version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of Crime Control. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have a different kind?) Is consistently shown with bitch quality scripts, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart at 20% of the dramatic capacity, Miles is the landscape chew, the movie know every c-list that was known in the mid-fifties with a hint of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to the 'backyard barbecue', all range of phases and backstages. Even the guns are canned and known. I think Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting outside settlements, nothing but a curio.
