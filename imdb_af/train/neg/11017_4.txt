A woman's nightmares burn her fear of being buried alive. The cheating man wants to kill her and decides to use her phobia well by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, B-horror movie queen Brinke Stevens changes into hidden ghostly creatures. The only reason to see this amateur mess is Michael Berryman in a very small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage is quite nice to watch. The special effects, for example, ridiculously beheaded head are really awful. Better watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Or of course, I don't expect classical entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be enjoyable.
