THIS MOVIE IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to exaggerate over a movie, but this movie stuffed my house !! I haven't even finished the movie yet and I had to stop commenting on how bad this movie is. I never did it !! As a consumer, don't spend your money on this movie. Wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something. It's scarce TV worthy. I really hate a movie, but this movie is a bump! Rare above pornography. Must have and X rating! Good plot, some preoccupation (if driving your boat), but HORRIBLE high school level acting. Don't know how this movie has received distribution. (Must have been a contractual thing.) Really, if you really watch good movie, don't waste your time with this one. From one movie lover to another. YOU WILL BE MAD! Let me also say, if you have been through such a thing, you may be related, and it will have value for you. In that case, I say it, you can take something away, if you don't just see something that happened to someone else (has therapeutic value).
