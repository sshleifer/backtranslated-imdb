Whoo-boy, it was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. Granted, it was on Sci Fi and I don't look at Sci Fi, but man talks about a razor thin plot and two-dimensional characters to the maximum. The characters were stereotypical and exaggerated, The plot and the environment were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny, the gore was unnecessary, the special effects were horrendously right and the end? Well, the only thing that was unpredictable at the end was when the butterfly suddenly became a lesbian and started doing it with the female vampire, which is by no means quite as hot, as it takes about three seconds. you are closer to "What the hell?" then "Man, it's hot." If it ever occurs in reruns, God forbids it, DO NOT see it.
