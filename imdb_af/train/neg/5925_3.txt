Is this the "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe it gets my voice at least 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no sense. To see something that makes you angry? Give me a chance. This episode also has a different feeling, the music is increased, almost forced to improve a sense of distress, to the point that it sucks. Give me Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher creatures like Triskelion's or anything but Medusin's, it's very boring strangers to make an episode. McCoy gets his famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim". Spock sits on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador, but Kirk doesn't. They are going to sow through the freaking "barrier" for the third time I can remember. At least season three's next episodes would be "Specter Of The Gun" and "Day of The Dove" and others to follow, and make Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where people like me as zealous fans will choose . Personal observations, Trek loved the color purple, his kind of pink purple, as when they are outside the compartment, the gangway is normally gray, now purple. We've never had a press bridge, but it's interesting to see. I noticed it in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode the passage in the ships is correct.
