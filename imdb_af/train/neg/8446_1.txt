Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where to laugh? There is no single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading actors are peculiar, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who can't make a Sicilian accent !!! Not to say about the dreamy insertion about Dracula. Just another fit, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to keep this movie a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was too hard to save. I would have given it "0" / 10, but the lowest point was 1/10 and therefore I had to overestimate it with one point.
