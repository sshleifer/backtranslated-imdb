... this verse doesn't miss the Bard so badly. It's still a horrible minimalist production. Hamlet's Dutch uncle was inexplicably named by a Spaniard (whether it is Ricardo Montalban or not subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell persuaded like never before. Most of the dialogue makes it undamaged, and the fact that the MST3K version is forced to repeatedly point out that the speeches are long * duh * doesn't make me so incredibly humorous. However, it is usually only bad.
