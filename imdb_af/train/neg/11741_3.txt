his costume drama is thrown ill and without charm. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was an excellent character actor. But he is quite indescribable here as the head, an eighteenth-century villain known for his philosophy and good looks. His costume is, of all people, Akim Tamiroff. Some Frenchman! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, as the virgin daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis is the best. The movie opens with her in silhouette. She is a sunglasses, and a naughty girl. She disappears for a while but appears in an unlikely situation. But she's fine. She was always an attractive actress. Here his neighbor was thrown to her usual kind of role. <br /> <br /> It is meant to be a bit naughty, kind of ooh-la-la. It had a light touch, but it is an empty case from start to finish.
