I may not be a great fan of the original "Creepshow", but his trashy sequel makes the anthology look like perfection! And to think I was going to expect it to keep this one more. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero, comes back on board the EC Comic Style route and on this excursion, the script for Steve King's three stories. Although the direction is given to Michael Gornick. The film mostly falls into this aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick. But most of the blame should go to Romero's terribly static and unbearable cringe-like script (especially in those dialogues that flow through the first and last story). Moralistic messages (which mostly came from acidic characters) simply took over the black humor. Oh, it was painful and the same can be said about the live rotten music score that accompanies the picture. Along with the three stories (Old Raft and The Hitchhiker), is a lightly curious and effective translation story done in the nostalgia (80s) animation form. I used to like this segment and the wisecracking Creep character was a glowing light. <br /> <br /> # The first story "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two elderly owners (George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour) of a general store in dying communities, Dead River. Get robbed and eventually killed by some punks that die to train in Hollywood. In front of the shop is a wooden image of an Indian chief who comes to live to avenge their death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy Waffle. And waffle for 10 minutes about how he is dedicated to his "big" community. What a fun, fine time. Well, just like Kennedy's speeches, it's a monotonous colorless and overdone item that never makes a good condition. The remaining writing is simple and the shows are so. These two factors added my headache. When the Indian becomes alive and apostates, the goons encounter a very quick (but creepy) death in the right way. The effects are done pleasantly, but those of those free-flowing hair. How can Hollywood hit that hair back? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # Second story "The Raft" follows a group of dope smoke and yahoo teenagers heading for a secluded lake. After swimming on the raft in the middle of the lake, they are trapped on the platform due to the ominous creatures lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> Now it's much better, much better. What starts when your basic teenagers run, is in a mysterious, scary setup that is full of scratch and clapping phobic tension. And it doesn't even look at the flashes of nudity or carelessness. It is very morbid and it is also for his sense of humor. The surprisingly ironic end has a beautiful touch to it. The actions of the nobodies are acceptable without making a big point. Gornick's direction sticks to the nasty and tough side. While the frightening music score on this occasion printed the right chords. The sluggish creatures in the lake look like a black black sail (yes you read it right!) Floating on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, number three ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich but sexually missing woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo, but she leaves late. To think of a few ideas to explain to her when needed, she slipped off the road and accidentally hit a hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she drives away hoping to get home for her husband. Soon enough, she is affected by the mutilated body of the deadly hitchhiker. <br /> <br /> Not terribly, but I really didn't get into this ridiculous ridiculous exercise. Compared to the first two, this one was so different in tone and trying to tickle the funny leg rather. Lois Chiles was in the lead, but the constant assurance and the small conversations she had with herself were painfully aggravating and getting tired. The bright makeup effects are well displayed and drip with vision. When hit, the hitchhiker is when it is crocheting, stocking and overlaying in its execution. From there we endlessly hear our repeated dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat ?? and repeat the line, "Thank you for the lady!" It happens every time she decides to run over him. Be a little polite for the dead treasure. <br /> <br /> Overall, the second short story "The Raft" and the unpleasant, well-found effects, is what highlights this inferior successor.
