To know Enki Bilal's comics for some time, I had to watch this movie. I thought it would be a great way for the artist like Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I'd enjoy it. I was wrong! The movie was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but film leaves too much to be desired, and basically everyone who watches this movie is having the impression that it can do better. I will not imagine whether to watch this movie or not. Chances are you'll read these pages you've already seen, or you'll see them - but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes.
