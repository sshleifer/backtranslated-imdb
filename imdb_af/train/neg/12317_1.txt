I'm sorry for fans of this movie, but it's the worst I've ever seen. Slowly, badly cast and acted heavily. It's a movie that has been trying to escape and fail the deadly romcoms over the past few years! McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey real emotions and are lifeless. They seem to be in this one for any payment control they get for it and not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! I love big chick movies as much as the next girl and it's not one !! If you avoid one year this year .... let it be
