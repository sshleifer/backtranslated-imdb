I like many of the actors / actresses involved in this project, so they are harassed by the movie even worse than when they use an unknown one. The main problem was that this movie was just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers. In 20 or 30 years, Nbc will probably do such a movie in the early 90's. I can now see it as a black family where the children are involved in the la riot and the white family rebels and listens to grunge rock music. The soundtrack will include bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. Contains. The movie like this will be as cheesy as the 60's and I assure you that NBC will do it. Seeing the biggest problem with periods when you buy networks is if you live in a certain time, you don't think I live the 60's or whatever the decade is currently trendy retro. The second time someone does something like that, they have to work more weight there.
