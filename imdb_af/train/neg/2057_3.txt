Sorry to go against the flow, but I thought this movie was unrealistic, boring and too long. I got tired of seeing Gena Rowlands a very serious struggle with herself and the crisis she experienced. Perhaps the film has a movie value or represents an important step for the director, but for sheer entertainment value, I wish I would have skipped it.
