Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and he gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white man. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the animated 2005 comedy, is better. It's a good movie, but Chris Rock did better than that. This will only let you laugh the whole movie 4 times. And it's not really nice out loud. You will laugh at yourself and you can giggle, but you will definitely not roll on the floor.
