I saw this movie at the Rotary Day Festival, so presumably all the other voters. The Director was present and worked very hard and is very dedicated to the project, which I think explains the above average reception. This is most similar to an episode of Aussie children's favorite "Round the Twist", but it takes too much to even have the redeeming feature. Perhaps the movie itself is worthwhile to see if you want to visit a movie touristic world trip that visits all UN member states. I can't think of another Fiji movie, but it was common, poorly acted (though by an amateur) and prey to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story reveals that indigenous islanders will try to screw each other, but as long as there is a significant white governor, all the problems can be solved (leaving the island).
