This movie is hardly good, not good at all. Some unforgettable scenes and the unfortunate choice to connect Norma Jean with an active actress. Jane Russell works for her, Marilyn's smaller wife and / or actress. One can only wonder why it is considered one of the highlights of her lame career. 10/03
