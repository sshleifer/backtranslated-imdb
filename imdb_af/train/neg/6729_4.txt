It is clear that many people really find it, but I found it as a childless and reasonably attacking codwatch, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and some unforgettable musical numbers, especially the opener (but later there is a clear embezzlement in the invention). I'm not going to Monroe - she has to play a stupid blonde who's not that stupid, but she's just stupid. Russell can't really convince if she claims she was never in a gym, but otherwise quite wonderful. The men are shockingly uninteresting, just like the plot. In no way atrocious, but so carnal that God helps us all, if it's a classic.
