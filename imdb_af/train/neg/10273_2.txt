As far as horror movies are concerned, I'm more than willing to suspend unbelief, ignore substandard production values ​​and ignore plot holes in the interest of good terror. These movies simply have no good scares to offer. It can't even be enjoyed by camp. Bad dialogue, bad behavior, bad direction, death was predictable and poorly performed, the music was annoying, the camera work was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I really felt bad for the actors, who obviously tried, but had to deal with a terrible, confronted dialogue and a clear lack of direction. I doubt they also have any rehearsal. It is embarrassing to watch, and as boring as spending it on the confronted "surprise" ending, requires tremendous endurance. It's pretty easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but this one was so bad that I was forced to warn others. This movie is a total waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, don't miss the "Making of" feature. The author / director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was a kind of fat, brave move. (See it.) He and the player spend half an hour deconstructing this movie as if it were a new age "Citizen Kane." Is. It's like listening to a group of third-graders, behind the scenes of their Christmas tournament. They really think they have created something of substance. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities, such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny." So "American Nightmare" is not the WORST movie I have ever seen, but I will have to say that it is fifty somewhere in the bottom.
