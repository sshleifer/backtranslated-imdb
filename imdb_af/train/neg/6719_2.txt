It's a good idea for a movie, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be a good movie. What starts out as a lovely and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control, in a bizarre combination of genres and a real piece of plots, with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE , SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a remarkable "dash" of 400 BLOWS thrown in the end. (At least the director did his research!) The rash isn't necessarily boring, but in the end it's not that good at all. But the actors all do a piece of work with the material and there are some good laughs in the back scene of gay porn. <br /> <br />
