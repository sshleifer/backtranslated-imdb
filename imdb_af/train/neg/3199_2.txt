Joe Don Baker. He was wonderful in "Walking Tall" and had a good deal in Goldeneye, but here in "Final Justice" all hope is gone. The dark side won. <br /> <br /> As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's generous meat and completely skew this movie. It's obvious they just started with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don kick and here they are continuing on a theme. <br /> <br /> It makes for a funny experience, but there are many choice riffs. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "This is" Meatloaf: Texas Ranger "", "None of them are spongy", "Why did she wear her prom dress asleep" and my favorite - Son of a ... 'What was he the son of a PREACHER MAN? <br /> <br /> In itself, "Final Justice", as Joe Don puts it in the movie, is a big fat nada. But here it actually has some entertainment value. You get a chance, catch this version of "Final Justice" <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice." Ten for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try to visit Malta when Joe Don is not in town.
