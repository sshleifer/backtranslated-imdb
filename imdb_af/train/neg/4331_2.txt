Soon after watching this movie you will realize why it didn't even come to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the prequel tag. Instead, it's a common theme in Hollywood, previously rolling out good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, and so on. <br /> <br /> This movie's plot was everywhere in the place like a table tennis ball, and character development was not there. I felt that on some points I watched a comedy in the movie because the play was so bad. P Diddy must stop filming with his horrible acting, letting me laugh daily. <br /> <br /> The only good thing coming out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, which looks great in this movie and actually If you are a great Carlito's Way fan, I advise you not to see it . If you decide to consider it anyway, then treat this movie as if it had torn the original, because that's exactly what it did.
