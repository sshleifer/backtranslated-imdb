OK, let me first say I'm still amazed at how the plot sucks, <br /> <br /> but again it's a movie that just follows a Steven-sail movie without Steven digging around !!! /> Just random low budget action scenes really no point, I'm still surprised that I burned 90 minutes on this crap !! !! Just rent a Jacky Chan movie or see the more fun and have no and not to have! plz plz plz avoid it !! bt the best actor playing there is Bill Goldberg and it says a lot! <br /> <br /> No, he doesn't play very well as I said, I avoid it. I still can't believe I have wasted 90 minutes and don't spend 10 minutes writing it !! :)
