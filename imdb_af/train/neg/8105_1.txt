Hard, yes, but I call them as I see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the late 80's, and it was truly one of the most horrible, boring movies I ever had to watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is beautiful. The Czech institutions are truly amazing. The political background is tempting, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (eg, Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this one has failed to make politics relevant to the story, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film succeeds in making even "erotic" scenes shatter and slow. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I was sure I would read the book, the story would have made a little more sense. But life is too short to spend more on this one.
