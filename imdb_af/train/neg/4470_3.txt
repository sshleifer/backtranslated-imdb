It is meant to be a comedy, but mostly bad taste, and nothing that causes a smile in the movie. The film is about a couple trying for a child, and the real-life people in that situation are going to be depicted on the portrayals depicted. For example, scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are frankly embarrassed. The male chief who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes over as a bad excuse for a rejection of Village People. The female head is looking 20 years younger than she is. Both leaders come across as unattractive, unattractive and totally unconvincing. There are several ridiculous and totally unpleasant movies in the film, for example with an airport that has no humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one point for Shirley Maclaine, who is a class above all else in the picture, and one point for half decent (though old) music.
