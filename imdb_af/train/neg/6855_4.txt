Why is it that a woman cannot be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man? The campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading Tom Sellick to the White House. That's all she can think of. So why on earth should she have a relationship with him? It did not contribute to the plot and only served to successful women. The only value of that turn was the cute "we all slept with your husband" scene. <br /> <br /> Can't the people who made this movie look at national conventions? Flight between the two major political conventions just thought to emphasize their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
