Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear he has no real knowledge of how to make movies. He made a brilliant movie and this is scary movie. scary movie 2 was also ok, but everything Keenan made was real disasters. Avoid such titles as, do not be a threat to the south central, while drinking your juice in the hood ..... I know what a title !!! of course, this movie, anything Keenans' name had in the credits. <br /> <br /> It was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me, maybe women might like this movie a bit because of a few things happening, but on the whole this movie will never be filmed by anyone with good taste. ....... jd Seaton
