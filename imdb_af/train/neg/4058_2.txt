From the start you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clich√©s. Your typical NRA member won't even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just because of acting William Benton. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. It is so biased to a "certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born badly. They are also not well-born. They are born with a clean slate. It is the society, parents and education that they make. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere in the line, it's definitely not going to be the US punishment that gets them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than wasting it on this piece of shit. <br /> <br />
