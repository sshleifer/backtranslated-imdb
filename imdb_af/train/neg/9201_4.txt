This is the film depicting the D & D fear of the 80's (and even today). The fear is that people who play D&D (or any other role-playing game) will be "inhaled" and lose their ability to distinguish the reality of fantasy (and about killing spores, child sacrifices, suicide, etc.). ). Big movie for anyone who likes to blame society for ominous objects, but anyone who played a role-playing game, a video game, or even performed in a play would be an insult to their intelligence regard. It's for D&D that Wargames was on computers. Plus as a movie, it's just a little suck.
