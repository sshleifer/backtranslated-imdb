Oh man, it's wonderful how someone can claim global warming to be a science. Well, I think this elitist nonsense now replaces the science of eugenics! Already Gore tries to make this problem complex sound, though it only needs sound sense to see, this whole thing is a big problem for a man with his own money making agenda! How did scientists estimate estimated temperatures of this planet? By estimating the sunspot activity. Has anyone ever questioned whether this method is accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how will it not be accurate to predict future temperature with sun-spot activity if it was so accurate in the past? According to solar activity, the temperature today is completely in line with what it should be. How did the temperature in the whole universe rise (relatively) as on earth? Do our SUVs keep the temperature on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use common sense! You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out that it can be nothing but a HOAX. Please investigate this yourself. How can Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (bank family who arranged a living earthly event) benefit from it? Well, the new World Bank will be based on carbon credits, which is tax on everything CO2 emissions do. It is easier to get away with this tax if people are lured to think it is to save the world if it is just about money, central control and more power to the elitist bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Isn't it noble to pay voluntary carbon credits to save the world, especially if it's in its own company? <br /> <br /> I don't want you to believe me blindly, please do your own research and use your own common sense, and I'm sure you'll come to the right conclusion!
