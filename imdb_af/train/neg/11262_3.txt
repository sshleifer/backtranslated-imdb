Adrian just went out of the shelter, rich and no parents, his life looks empty. One day he met Gonzalo, a poor boy, whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to earn money, Gonzalo Adrian helps to search for his life and who are his parents. It is a movie by a new director, and it is quite clear in most of the movies: scenes that aren't right, dialogues are a bit forced, some indifferences in writing. Anyway, the end is done unexpectedly a little bit and it saves a bit of the movie. Actors are known and of good quality, yet they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; everyone did better documents in other films. The movie becomes boring and you will probably spend most of the time thinking about how much time will pass until it ends. Of course, there are many worse movies, but surely there is much better.
