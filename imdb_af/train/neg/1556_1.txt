I was China in this movie. I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was in Italy at the time and they couldn't print my real name correctly. That's why I choose Sheeba and add Alahani as it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I've never acted (and it shows), but it was so much fun to film. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which of course was not usable). They called my voice (thank you). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of humor and jokes. This movie was never meant to be taken seriously. It was a tax written off by domestic information. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the pleasure I had in it.
