Revolt of the Zombies has no redeeming qualities. I'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad and that in 1936 the effects had to be more of a punch. I guess that's not true: it's not like IQs have risen sharply over the past 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this junk as the average viewer today. Why? Just try to watch the first scenes, and count the pauses between things that happen, the awful choice of when to close, the slapdash editing that includes an extra two seconds on each shot to push the run time . Pay attention to the completely redundant dialogue: "I'm going to make / go outside / read my book now." "Are you?" "Yes I am." This kind of exchange happens several times. Usually, I would like it to be a BIG fan of bad movies, but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and boring lines, and all the desire to laugh, fades slowly. This kind of uninteresting, pot-boiling time warmer is much worse than energetic, imaginative mind-blowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Those who claim to be "better" than the more interesting movies have a decline in entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw is surprised: it is bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly getting bored. What's much worse.
