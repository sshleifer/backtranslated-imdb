This is a truly miserable "LOCK STOCK" clone with a star cast and a horrible script. I have no idea why so many top British actors joined this junk, they had to be bribed. A lost storyline game continues forever and if I didn't pay good money for it, I would have turned it off after 10 minutes. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, the honor goes to the truly pathetic use of the movie of a movie "(I use the term loosely)` GUMMO '(I feel like begging the so-called "director" for the lost hour and half of my life), but this rubbish is almost right there. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on real horrible movies.
