This is probably one of the worst French movies I've seen so far, including over 100 French movies I've ever seen. Terrible performance and many mediocre / unprofessional acting causes the governments to be powerless. with all that matter no matter how beautiful west west scene and fancy music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this movie is that these two characters are NOT attracting people to an audience. I don't care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> It surprised me how this movie won jury prize in cannes, man, I love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one. A great disappointment to me.
