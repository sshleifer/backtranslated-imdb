It should be the most cornest TV program on the air. It's probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent from his younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and never spoken again, except in a negative way. Jim has to retire or something. Please let them go off the air. If I'm joking out of that performance, I'll throw and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. I should rather be taken from the devil than to see a full half hour of that program. I still don't understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deeply that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. Finally, no longer please.
