The Hazing is confused mumbo jumbo who wants to be so hard to be The Evil Dead, even referring to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is, it's just not in the same league as that awesome movie. This movie is nowhere near as original. The plot was previously used by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and it was much nicer. This movie wastes too much time with complicated exposition before the kids come into the haunting mansion and start the demonic events. <br /> <br /> As usual, Brad Dourif is not given much to do here, but when he is on the screen, he puts in another top performance that Christopher Walken will envy. Regarding the behavior of the children, it is acceptable, but not at all good. The shaky camera work is more annoying than smart or atmospheric. There are a few good moments when the first man gets possession and throws about deadly one liners while sending his victims, but it never was terrifying for a second. The gore level is medium to low, but the director tries to fix it by making the actress look topless a few times. All in all, just fine if you have 87 minutes to waste.
