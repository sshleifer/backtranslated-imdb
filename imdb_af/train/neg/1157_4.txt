I finally watched the tenants with my good friends who rented the movie, based solely on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of them) on the cover. Understandable, I didn't expect much. I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behaviors and images often seen in clich√© rap videos. However, my generalization was mostly wrong. Unfortunately, it didn't make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, while describing it as a dark, seriously-eroded drama movie. The film tells a story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the movie like a wild roller coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a serious case of split personality disorder. And while the movie is a drama, the play - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and the company is more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie for those who have attention. disadvantaged because this one has a lot of dialogue and much dialogue afterwards. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are usually inundated with more dialogue. However, the end jumped to me with a sudden surprise. It was a bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to include a movie that needed to end. While I watched the final credit, I couldn't help thinking the director: "Oh God, how hell do I make this snoozer." By the way, the director laid out carefully planted tips and subtleties that led to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo, in a busy street of midgets that carry nothing but black jerseys.
