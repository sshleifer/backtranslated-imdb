DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat stupid comedy about a lot of women merging to repel each other's men. It is by no means painful like some comedies I can name, but it is never its potential. Imagine how good it could have been if we had the Farrelly brothers directly to Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Just curious because the catch phrases on Dr Elson's show are "looking after each other and keeping talking"
