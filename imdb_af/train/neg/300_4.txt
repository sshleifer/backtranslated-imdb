Robert Taylor certainly proved himself to be a good dramatic actor in his role as a gun-wielding buffalo hunter in this 1956 Western. It was one of the few times Taylor would play a hard part in a movie. Yet this photo was far from big as soon after. Taylor fled to the television with the successful series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and worked in a formidable performance as Taylor's mate. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good show here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an elderly man who is drinking old-timer who also joined the hunt for buffalo. In his early scenes, Nolan made an excellent start in 1948 with Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre. Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the movie. The next year, Tamblyn and Nolan, will participate in the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> The writing in the movie is at best tight. By the end of the movie, Taylor is the element of nature. How about the elements of writing here?
