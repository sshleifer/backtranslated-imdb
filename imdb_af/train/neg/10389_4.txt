Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action hero / romantic head Doug McClure are back in this ghost story in Japan. They were moderately successful in the 1970s, such as 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976), etc. Etc. Without plastic samples to carry the narrative, the results are inaccurate. and derivative in the most corny way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a prologue in the 19th century, with a samurai man killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide. A move to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura, who visit Japan and enter the house where the tragedy occurred. <br /> <br /> No surprises about what happens, with the spirits of the dead beginning to take over the new residents with family friend Alex (McClure) and accept the role of the woman's lover. <br /> <br /> Everything smells cowardly with the elegance and grace of an elephant who uploads, to an inevitable (but surprisingly cunning) ending. Key points are two poor decapitations ('The Omen' has much to answer for this as a standard horror piece), and love stories with do-eyed but extremely kinky Susan George. The first is a long 'Do Not Look Now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; The second a lot shorter (probably on her insistence) entanglement with McClure, both seem uncomfortable. Anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show off its fantastic clatter, so everything is not lost. Overall, I can't decide whether 'The House where Evil Dwells' is rubbish, daring, or entertaining in a masochistic type. If you're not in the genre, there's nothing here, but for horror fans there is probably enough to lure the strange rogger and the acting node of respect for effort. <br /> <br /> BEST SCENE - in any other movie the big, black, tree climb, Japanese-mumbling mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. However, they are obscured by the legendary family meal, where a ghostly head appears in the girl's soup. Asking this phenomenon, she asks what soup it is (!!!!), to tell meat and vegetables, before the immortal line "Ugh - a terrible face in my soup" is expressed. If that wasn't enough, the answer is 'C'mon, eat your soup for Dad.' Laurel & Hardy rest.
