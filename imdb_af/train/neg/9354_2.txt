There is an important aspect of film that Jobson has forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. You don't have to tell the audience what to think, because they will see it. The action here is confused with some of the most peculiar narratives expressed on the unsuspecting public - the press prose of the sensitive fifth former. And it must be unnecessary because they are a fine cast here and some beautifully crafted and shot visuals. Maybe Jobbo felt the basic story needed some support. And he could have been right, it has a basic credibility: 70s Edinburgh wasn't exactly full of pretty beautiful girls with a love for the Velvet Underground and a gentle place for a passing sociopath. Of the neat and newly-watched clothing that carries the character of the cod intellectualism that tries to connect everything, everything is to my liking.
