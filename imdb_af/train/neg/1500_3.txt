Oh, it's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain such a thing is a porn festival with drugs that led to the decision to just make a movie. I mean: you get porn actresses topless, have sex, then killed by human mutants. There are many gores, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, it is half the person she was earlier" and caused the accidental murder by panic. But you can also find funny things like guts drawn by someone's ass, and a man walking in the forest finds himself tied by a wire tied between two trees. It then makes a metal sound, as in cartoons. Somehow there is a market for people who go outside pornography, they really need to know what is in an actress, but only genitals are not enough. That is why you get many summarizing options on bimbos. There is NO dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have very small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when they took a role here. I think it's a movie one has to watch with the button on a fast forward and just look at the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old school C horror movies.
