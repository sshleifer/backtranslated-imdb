The assumption of the movie is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was cruel - and he got a chance to take revenge when he rightly comes to a posttraumatic stress disorder. He was tied in a room with a man to a chair and said it was the culprit. He gets a large table of tools that offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, sledge hammers, torches, whatever you might think, someone could possibly use to physically hurt another person. <br /> <br /> We'll find too many scenes of torture before we find out that The Man Archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime. The two then create an awkward alliance; who has them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we really don't care ...
