"Scary Movie 2" is a departure from the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this one was so boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they chose their daily action and made two more big Scary Movies. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teenagers criticized by their professor for going to a haunted house for a night. Things start going wrong and then they realize they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible, but they could have improved a lot. It's a little fun and if you like the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise, give it a watch - but I don't think you'll love it so much.
