The more I think about it, there was nothing about this <br /> <br /> movie. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory might have made it worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as a 4 out <br /> <br /> 10. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I met the director. he was so clueless <br /> <br /> about what he did or what he did, and as far as I could <br /> <br />, he didn't care for the movie. even he agreed that he did not really know <br /> <br /> what he had done and he had to do certain things <br /> <br /> because it was digitally filmed. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was trying hard to fit the formula it built <br /> itself for itself: "9 people must all be connected in one way or another <br /> <br /> We can come from point 'A' to show 'B', so we get from the <br /> <br /> prostitute, we see in the beginning and back to her at the end 10 <br /> <br /> minutes about each character's relationship with another person <br /> <br /> make one feel choked by the 2 demeanor, poorly drawn <br /> <br /> characters. <br /> <br /> I just remember the one redeeming part of the movie .. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi there is one scene where he is wonderful. /> <br /> say ... 4 out of 10.
