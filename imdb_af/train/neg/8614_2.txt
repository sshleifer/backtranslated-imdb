I must admit that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, he has no respect for me. I just watched it because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without any real humor. It's full of lame, rude jokes and a completely ridiculous plot that goes around a developer's (Dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in Utah that didn't catch my attention at all. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield, the film played a poor role, including the likes of Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (I didn't even know he was still around until I left seen the name in the credits for this. <br /> <br /> It's really a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
