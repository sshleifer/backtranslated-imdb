It's one of the worst B-slashers I've ever seen in my life. The end is something you should see to believe. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their dad come into the chimney while wearing a Santa suit. He puts the gifts under the tree, eats the biscuits and milk and then returns to the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry just gets off to get his dad dressed up in a Santa suit that his mother enjoys sexually. Then Harry climbs up stairs, strikes a snowball, grabs a glass of glass and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then you continue on the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa suit and sees little children through a binoculars. He has two books. One book for good children and the other for bad children. He writes down everything he does in these books. The man is a creep. He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful home. <br /> <br /> When Harry finds out that his boss is just looking for profit, he goes and collects all the toys and supplies them to a few children. . Then he traveled to a church and killed 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts gifts under the tree. The children catch him, but they go back. So, Harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he walked to a house, a lot of children came to him and ran to him. The parents are nervous and try to get their children back so they don't get hurt. How do they know Harry is the killer? Sure, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it can be. Harry gives the children gifts and the father pulls out a switch to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs away, the village lights light up and follow him to kill him. They don't even know he's the killer. When Harry reached his brother's house, his brother and he talked a little and Phillip strangled him. He only loses consciousness. Phillip put Harry back in his van. When Harry wakes up, he goes off. <br /> <br /> The end is something I couldn't believe. Again you have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bent me was the black Santa. That's right, the man in the Santa suit they saw was a white man. So why did they bring in a black man? <br /> <br /> Skip it and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Kill. You get your money worth seeing the two movies. They are better than this stack of garbage! I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what this movie deserves.
