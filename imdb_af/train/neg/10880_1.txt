It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have quite an appetite for horrible (and good) movies. It could have (just) managed some sort of adolescent humor if it was consistently in the cheek - la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really funny. Other movies, like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, are really funny while (apparently) trying seriously. As far as the acting is concerned, they seem to have finished brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad lib the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - that of the older ghoul breaker on the motorcycle.
