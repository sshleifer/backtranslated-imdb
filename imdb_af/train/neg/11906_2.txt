As a teenager in the late 80's, there was a "Er Himmel über Berlin", it was a great experience for me - "that's what the movies can be". Along with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the end of the world" it still has a special place in my heart and mind - a proof of the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, years later saw a steady decline in the quality of his work with the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" which hit a terribly low point. Away is the fascinating pictures or music. No search for or display of good insight. All that remains is characters and thinly secure political statements, which are nothing but clichés and make the honesty of an adult audience honest. <br /> <br /> Did the well run dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to stop or stop them completely.
