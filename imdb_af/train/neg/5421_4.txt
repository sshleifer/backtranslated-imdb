This is one of the topics I can relate to a little more than most people, as I have been in a hurry and have no idea how those in big cities, New York, especially sleep people! It amazes me that people can stand the noise all day long. The basic plot of the movie is that it makes an interesting subject. It's too bad, it's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent, although it wasn't for a few scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel that Margarita Leiveva looks at), he didn't look right there. My biggest hope for this movie is that the decisive agents will see the absolutely stunning and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She doesn't have much to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. Even when they try to look at her next girl. It makes me sad that there could be people like Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world without relentless skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I don't care about this movie, because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I got new talent. I hope that producers and directors about Margarita think if they need a beautiful new actress to be big budget movie. If they can make Megan Fox a star, she's not that hot, and her acting talent is worse than it's made for Disney channel TV shows. From one movie, it must be easy for her, because she is beautiful and has talent! I would recommend that she change her name so we can pronounce it and make it marketable. Here's hoping it'll make her career, and if that's right, she may appear on some great summer movies or two the next few years.
