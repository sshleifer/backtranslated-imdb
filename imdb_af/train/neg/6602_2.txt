For my life I can't figure out why someone would make such a movie. The plot is tired, the acting is tense, the language is consistently dirty and sometimes the use of the "F" word was generally as if a lack of dialogue was common, so let's put another pair of "F's" throw good measure. that's what the American public wants to hear '. Gossett was especially dirty and enjoyed his part. Forget this c__p, rent 'Shrek' and enjoy a good laugh.
