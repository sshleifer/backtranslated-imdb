Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just makes the mind fall asleep. This show isn't funny, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a steamy pile of bull bulls. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that sound like a fingernail on a blackboard. The tuner could have been better. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just to see it. Everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy-covered. Then there's the humor, or the lack thereof. It's totally idiotic! They just take those B jokes that aren't even funny, and then repeat them to death. They also throw in a little senseless pot of humor that makes me sick. And lastly, the last and least, the music. It's just annoying. It sounds like it is composed on a child's computer and does not cause emotion. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This view must be canceled seriously. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. When I hear the theme song, I immediately turn off the TV. If you've never watched this show, don't do it. Watch quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
