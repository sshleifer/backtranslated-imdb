It's about the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie is similar to the quality of such movies as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even those had names where this one fell short. The "eye candy" of this movie looks like a 50-woman with a bad face. (just an example of the quality). I would have classified this movie as negative. Ladies, I have to tell you that the men were not bad at looking at, but not much at all. If you were planning to watch this movie, I would highly recommend saving you money.
