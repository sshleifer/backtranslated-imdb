"SherryBaby" is a painful and sordid melodrama in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is fighting and fighting for a drug-related belief to stay clean, find a place for herself in life and especially for win back the love of her daughter who is cared for by her brother's family. The only reason to watch the movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress who fits her career. It fits very well into the roll and carries the whole movie on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, as the story line is too simplistic and expected and the emotional emphasis is placed in the wrong place. I have already asked about the picture whether I should be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addict as the director and writer wanted, or about the innocent child in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's play couldn't convince me that I no longer care about the child.
