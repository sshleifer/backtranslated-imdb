Half past Dead, starring Steven Seagal starring was a big B hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, losing an action movie with nothing, but with no ability to win anything. It's less entertaining than the first one: in all respects. But it is worth a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; If you also want to watch former WWE stars on the screen or even if you like watching sequels, even if they are live or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he was not working. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the work, but nothing wonderful, nothing far from good. <br /> <br /> Technical details, though, a production made by Sony cannot be good. Cinematography was a disaster, but overall direction was acceptable. Whatever, just watch it if you want. If you look, you won't lose anything. But if you don't, you won't lose it either.
