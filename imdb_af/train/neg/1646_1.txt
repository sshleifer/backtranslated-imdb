I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but it was too much. The acting wasn't great, but it wasn't the real problem. The problem was the sinking feeling I got in the film about 20 minutes in the pit. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and what little they had was devoted to the cruelty they had in the face of friendship to each other. Exploring the dark sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters real personalities, or they are just cardboard cuttings. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
