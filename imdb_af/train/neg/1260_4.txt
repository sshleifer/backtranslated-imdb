Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname Donna Reeds's romantic head played by Tom Drake's brand! So we can immediately make it clear. From her first role in the GET-AWAY (1941) to her last, DALLAS (1984-1985), Mrs. Reed, could never be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and smart actress. Who's roles at M.G.M. seldom lived to her talents. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Reed is supported by role-players of skillful character characters, who unfortunately have to run through this alleged 'screw ball' comedy. It is clear that M.G.M. was out of their depth to make this type of film. A type better manufactured at COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the "touch" of Ernst Lubitsch or the white of Preston Sturges can save this film. A little conventional romantic comedy that had all the marking of a pre-war (WWII) effort. <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg was still alive, the screenplay would already have been significantly rewritten or never seen. light of day. It has just been in Louis B. Mayer's 'safe zone' of no challenging family entertainment. A form that cannot lead to the post-war challenges of the DeHavilland decision, the loss of their theater chains, television and will contribute to the decline of M.G.M. Fortunetly for Donna Reed is her best days in front of her apart from HERE TO HONORY (1953) and her Oscar tournament as Best Supporting Actress.
