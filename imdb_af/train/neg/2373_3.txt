WARNING: OVERVIEW CONFIRM MILD SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and planned to review the entire Elm St. series to make. But just two years and I find I can't remember enough of them to do this ?? I think they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I remember, some of the persecutors ?? Dreamwriters in particular? was not as bad as often made up, although even the original was not classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep, they are murdered in their dreams) does not lend itself to narrative tension. But while I can't recall much of the first five movies, I know they're never the depths of Freddy's Dead. <br /> <br /> An indication of how sick of Freddy was the public can be judged at this stage. the fact that the film was only promoted on the character's demise. The fact that the film's conclusion is not even hidden, but in reality is the purpose of the film to illustrate how empty, soulless and cynical this business was. <br /> <br /> With the morally questionable idea of ​​a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less targeted at the characters than at the teenage audience who could ever see this time. It's like Englund's cry: "We know it's garbage, but you pay to see it, so, who's laughing at one?" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be discouraged from seeing such an insensitive portrayal of their fate. Was Freddy's appearance in the movies always so rudimentary? All he does here is a few "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr har har har" and that is it. If it was the only Elm St. movie you've ever seen, you wouldn't know the character at all. Even if the character before-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-lift pantomime villain, with a snake Transatlantic (ie over-emphasized, wrong and not funny) irony. <br /> <br /> The action is almost universal poor. Just look at how often Breckin Meyer hands over with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper go up, you can almost see the film sinking further into the ant. The writing is also absolutely common, virtually without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) makes a road map, on which the Noel Coward-like Freddy wrote a writer, "you're f ** ked". When asked for the card, Carlos responds: "Well, the card says we're f ** ked". Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> How about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, raising his audience to painful levels? So Freddy hurt him by threatening to drop a pen? a potentially lethal sound as all sounds are enlarged. Oddly enough, the fact that Carlos screamed on top of his voice for him not to drop, seems to have no effect. "Nice to hear from you, Carlos," Freddy sniffs, hoping there will be some better lines. It is also noteworthy that dream beats do not take place immediately, so it is unconsciously beaten, will not allow direct access to Freddy's world. Although part of the story contains a human computer game and a 3-D final plot logic is not as high on the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenagers at the head are really the most unpleasant, unfair group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who greets Freddy with "the f ** k, the man" and a kick in the scapegoat. And was unceasing pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughter. No terrorists. No interest. No fun. <br /> <br />
