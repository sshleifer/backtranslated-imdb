I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this one is horrible. Death is so trendy. If you had to look this 20 years later, the whole nintendo scene is outdated. I had the flashbacks. I think they just had to make a prequel when he was still alive. It would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. Depends on how much savings you have.
