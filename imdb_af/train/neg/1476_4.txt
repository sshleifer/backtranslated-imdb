This rather formal sword and flying fist movie is a decent early performance of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and some of the swords are really remarkable. Unfortunately, the movie works under the burden of a dull story and a sudden low budget (see some of the selected battle scenes if you doubt me). Nevertheless, it is worth seeing, especially if you can catch in mailboxes.
