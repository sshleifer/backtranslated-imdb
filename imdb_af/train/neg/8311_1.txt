What this movie doesn't answer is how wrong this war is (and most American wars have just made a little oil recently). There were many innocent civilian casualties, how many lives had perished and how blatantly the perpetrators were. <br /> <br /> So, let me ask you - if American soldiers kill women and children other than the enemy, it's OK, but if government accidentally kills their own powers by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians than Well , that's not? Your logic fails, sir. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 5 for solid performance and 1 for everything, 3 in total.
