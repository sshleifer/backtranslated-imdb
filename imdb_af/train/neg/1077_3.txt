Have you ever heard the saying that people are telegraphing their intentions? Well, in this movie, the characters' actions do more than telegraph plans for future plans - they appear drunk at your home and hold you over the head. It can be forgiven if the environment is better used, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wood, and Kenneth Branagh fails to wear the brash charm. His character is probably written to have. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, indifferent characters, and grotesque "southern" accent serving British actors.
