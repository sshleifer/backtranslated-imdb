Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It starts out interesting but loses a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help much that none of the normally good actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc) deliver a very good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be due to the fact that I saw a dual version (German), but Dennis Quaid's character was especially wood and annoying, and Danny Glover didn't really make a credible villain. In addition, Jared Leto's character doesn't really add to the story (except to save one main character's life at one point, but the scene is in the first place as needed as a submarine windshield wiper ;-) < br /> <br /> About the unnecessary scenes, the main complaint speaks the real and clich√©-famous storyline: The detective (of course!) needs to fix a personal case with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official license of his personal entanglement. The killer (of course!) * Want * to be tracked and play a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I don't know how many movies on a similar plot build - most of them are better, but. <br /> <br /> The plot has many holes and very completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline (eg the truck stop or the car at the rock edge etc.) <br /> <br /> To try it out, the end is trying to be original and exciting, but it is quite successful in this regard. We've seen a lot * better final with a similar kind of eventual battle-on-a-train-in-a-lost-winter-landscape setup ... In the end, there is the supposedly moving reunification of parent and child ... Hokey, at least.
