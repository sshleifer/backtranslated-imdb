Like many other pop culture franchise series, this line just didn't know when to stop. Instead of leaving things off when they were finished, they continued; the first installment of this franchise falls short of the point. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have happened. It wasn't meant to be a fourth movie in that line, and it certainly shows. The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same. <br /> <br /> After the wonderful experience of The Omen, it was a great disappointment that has stench of 70's cheese and horrible acting. It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects, and left a terrible, prolonged stench, long after it was over. <br /> <br /> It's a 1.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
