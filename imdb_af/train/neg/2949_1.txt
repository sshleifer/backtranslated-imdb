Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? Let me give you a choice; you can either a) blink it and rinse it in the toilet or b) make a movie based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a futuristic policeman with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like "I have not rushed trumpet "and blowing raspberries on the basis that it's funny. That's right, you will choose the option that has more earnings - the end of the toilet. <br /> <br /> It should be seen as believed. I can't even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It doesn't even fit in the "so bad - it's good" category. I actually have it on television as I write - and while I was watching, I had the need to get on IMDb and register my horror. <br /> <br /> Considering Jurassic Park was made a few years earlier, how on earth did it? they think audiences will endure a man wearing a rubber suit? WG simply had to walk and condemn the consequences. Everyone involved will go to hell for this criminal waste of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm imploding.
