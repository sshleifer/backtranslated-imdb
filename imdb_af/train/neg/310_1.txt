I have never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on Blockbuster's wall. If I was a Adam Sandler fan, I rented it. FIRST I could only watch about 30 minutes. from that. It was awful. Do what it takes to keep it out of the public. I honestly hope this movie will soon open, and I hope it will be so!
