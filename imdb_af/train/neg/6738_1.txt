There are so many movies based on the same theme. single cute girl needs a handsome boy to impress ex, pays him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there is a little cut, followed by a row before everyone ends up before the happy ending .. .... has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The thing is, I knew it before I started looking. But in spite of this I still looked forward to it. In the right hands, with a good throw and a clear writing, it can be another pleasant way to pass a few hours. <br /> <br /> it wasn't one of these. <br /> <br /> This was rare. <br /> <br /> A female head is missing in charm or white that has failed to lift even the slightest spark in me. I didn't really care if she got her husband, or stayed alone and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male head who, after some of his infinite words of wisdom, wanted to kill. Just to remove the alley look. I had no idea that leading a man of a male whore was the way to see all-enlightening relief. <br /> <br /> A totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. None of them had work, everyone had more money than sentence, a groom still going ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend .... plus "I'll miss you as if we never met "!!!!! I can go on, but I just realized I was wasting more time on this foam ..... I can rant to have a character just to have a very cheap laugh by the name "woody" but in truth the Net remotely humorous thing that happened in the movie.
