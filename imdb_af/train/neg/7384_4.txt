STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a resonance mission with three new youngsters strike teams recruited after they did not hear a direct command from above. But the night before they go on strike, they are all seriously killed by a killer with seemingly inhuman power. With the French police wandering with their own investigation, he is looking for those who are responsible for exposing only a corrupt fraction of the army dealing in a deadly new drug that changes a person's DNA and they give new strength. <Br /> <br /> Bad coverage. Bad title. Bad post production toddlers. And bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But I have to say, I don't think Attack Force is quite the worst. I know it will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think many of the criticisms have come from all the bad news that went before the movie, rather than its real quality. br /> <br /> I have to say there was so much duplicate or rumbling editing anywhere I was running. The dubbing was there (which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) Was pretty awful and very frequent, but not in use for as much a segment of the movie as I thought. The plot also flowed slightly smoothly, and that was also the consideration of all the mess with the original completed film Harvester going on. Also, as another reviewer noticed, the movie has a pretty Gothic look, a new touch for a Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute killer low point was the complete and total lack of exciting action, with just a few poorly filmed fighting scenes for any pleasure. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, though, I'd rather see it as Flight of Anger, today you're going to die or die for a kill. **
