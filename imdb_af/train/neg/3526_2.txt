(Spoiler included, some will say) <br /> <br /> This movie is not possible to take seriously. In some parts, it's so terribly silly that I can't help it. Try me for the order where Stallone's character jumps about 20 meters with a full climber or (and it's really my favorite) sniffing a bad man by sticking him on a stalactite. Yes, what wicked power has he created to achieve such feats? I don't know, but he certainly gives the reality a run for the money.
