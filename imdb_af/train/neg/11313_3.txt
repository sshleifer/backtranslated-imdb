and it doesn't help Rohmer's case that a few years later Syberberg came together and made a surprisingly large piece of work on the same subject (with some help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie is not does not seem as good as it came out without the syberberg film comparing it, probably was shot on an even smaller sound stage with few resources. Actually, I can't remember if there are horses in the syberberg movie at the moment. All I know is the German version is pure magic, while this one looks like a college production documented on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> The music ... la musique ... is not even credited here on IMDb ... but somebody based it on "airs of the 12th-14th century" or something ... well , it's not a good help for the movie. It comes down as uncomfortable and cheesy !!! <br /> <br /> Rohmer is one of those French authors who keep their prominent men generally unattractive and helpful. Syberberg's Parsifal was rich and can be seen on German television today. I am selling a special bike that he invented. <br /> <br /> I am thinking to watch what the syberberg is watching on video. I remember the last time I saw the movie in a theater, the pressure was so bad that the experience was a huge 5-hour transvest, but even then it would have to surpass what this version offers. I am scared. <br /> <br /> points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but ... this movie simply needs more beau-coup. it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript, it looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! Oh yes, it ends up randomly with Parsifal going to church, and this cheese-like passion game is being used ... blah!
