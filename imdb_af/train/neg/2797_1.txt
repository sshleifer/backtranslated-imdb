I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really "good" bad horror flicks. But these movies have nothing to justify! I'm not going to spend much time on everything that's wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The writing is terrible. The acting is terrible. The FX is not even worth discussing. The "set" is an absolute JACK !! The sad thing is that I think there may be some potential players in some of the actors, but this vehicle left them nothing to work with. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say I've seen it as "free" and feel I'm robbed !! The time you want to waste will be better spent washing your cat.
