Hello there, <br /> <br /> This is my first placement in IMDb, although I've been using it for some time. So I want to greet you all. The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably influence my judgment. I hope not for your annoyance. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (everything our Greeks actually did), Omirus email (and not Homers like you see anywhere), rhyme with rhyme. If I remember well, it was Iliada (Iliad) on 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) on 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a huge disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus (I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad email is one of the best literature works ever made. It has been compiled by a Greek poet Omirus for 400 years after the actual war. Historians have placed Trojans war around 1200 BC, and the real reason for the war is not Helen's beauty, but Troy's strategic critical position. It is said that one can now understand that Omirus email does not present the real events (as it is not historically correct), but it was never the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> To read this great poem, one can find himself for the definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational were also these long-standing talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these were revealed in 'Troy' <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectuals, English Finnish and German colleagues from me. It's a pity to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, perfect storm was a bad and stupid (computer graphics did the whole job), and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> I conclude that you'd rather look at something else. I'll give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a very expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
