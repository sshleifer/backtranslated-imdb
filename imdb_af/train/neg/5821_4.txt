As others have noted, it had to be an excellent Hammer style movie, and it seems to me that most actors have commissioned it to play ... but the script is so loaded, weak and filled with a very dull solo movie. (weak Timothy Dalton is anointed with most of them) that it is all too overblown and self-evident. This is an uncharacteristically poor performance of Dalton, although he quietly left the climate scene where Dr. Rock finally realized what he did. The only actor who comes down very well is Patrick Stewart, who is a welcome view. Freddie Francis may have been a wonderful filmmaker, but he was a foolish director.
