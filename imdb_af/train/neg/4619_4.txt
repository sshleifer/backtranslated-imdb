Let me first declare that I love the stories of the Western and Civil War. I also see John Ford as an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne and William Holden's acting ability. <br /> <br /> I can't remember seeing this movie when it only came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I've seen it since then. <br /> <br /> As per my 4 rating, one might say I didn't have the movie. <br /> <br /> I will now try to tell some of its shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Mahin, who wrote the script of Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote many fine scripts. This writing was poorly written and badly investigated. They mention the terrible conditions of the Andersonville prison. By the time of the film Andersonville was not in use. They also use guns not used at the time. <br /> <br /> For 40 years, John Ford has been director and won 4 Oscars. He had to be sick while making this. His usual style was missing. It could be that it was film in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually had a stock company of players he used in almost all his films. This time, only small cowboy stars have role playing Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except the 3 stars. (see below) Fords's stock company has made most of its films the classic people; unfortunately missed here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The Duke also had to be sick. He stood out of the place here. This kind of role usually fits his style perfectly, he was just enough here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he normally was. <br /> <br /> There was a need for an actress in this kind of movie. Here in her first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress. She still has roles on television. Let me be kind and say she had a long career, more based on her appearance and acting talent. Also in Mrs. Towers servant is Tennisster Althea Gibson. I'm glad she held on to tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford movies. There were some military-type songs that were supposedly done by the marching cavalry, is not good at all. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
