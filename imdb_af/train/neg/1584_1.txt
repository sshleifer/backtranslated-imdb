I read the running man of the Kings books as Bachman and I felt for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been so much more. The trouble? It was during the big action movie madness. I watched the movie and was painful throughout the thing. I felt nothing for the character and less for his case. Yes, it had funny scenes (or ridiculous) though I think it didn't save the film in my eyes. When you read the book, you can feel the climax and the fire in John's heart when he gets his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a low number. It might not be as low as I didn't read the book.
