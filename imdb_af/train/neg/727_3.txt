I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started making the incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I didn't even laugh at this short story, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, this short seems to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a dim cartoon is always no gag payout. Good Night Elmer was boring because it played forever with two forwards. This cartoon, on the other hand, is hit by the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The cartoon has at least two gags on its sleeve, but most look longer than they are due to the massive stuffing of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer ends with dinner and says: "It was very disgusting way from wamb," possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters read out loud in the Woody Woodpecker cartoons don't count in not my book). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to an unnecessary dialogue. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit wasn't a fun cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck. Jones and can't admit that he had a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it.
