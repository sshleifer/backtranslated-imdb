I'm shocked that there were people who like this movie. I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed at the scene, which wasn't meant to be funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but frankly the plot was needed for this movie. Review. It didn't even make sense, one second asked the characters how exactly they were snoring. scene they are hopelessly addicted and find out how to make it ?? The end also took the cake. I'm not going to spoil the wonderful conclusion. But it almost combined with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... see this movie for comedy if you have to ..
