Scary Movie 2 was a great disappointment. Simple reference to movies, such as Mission Impossible 2, does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny whites-rapping scene and excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie unfortunately comes from there. The acting is terrible. Tori Spelling looks completely out of place. The movie looks kinked and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer gags in this snake-active movie, which includes joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, are funny to anyone in my theater. The movie unfortunately comes in 83 minutes in a shocking end. (I say shockingly because the end doesn't even end with humor). I don't know what else to say, except that it is a sloppy, fast-track sequel to Miramax making more money on dumb teenagers. Overall, a very poorly-formed film.
