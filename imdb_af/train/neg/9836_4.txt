John Scott (John Wayne) and partner Charlie Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are trailmen who make their way to the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a fairly fair participant, but finds that unless he is willing to accept twenty-five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crown promoter, he has to pick up his profits at rifle point. Coincidentally, Bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they want the rest of the rodeo; they shoot the promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall) and make it like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a running gag in the movie where they want to use their fists over different trivialities. Every time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne bumps him and knocks him stupid. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, there is a neat Lipton's Tea ad in one of the scenes in which Scott's love interest Anne (Mary Kornman) appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, the girlfriends are again being over a stage robbery. With a heartbreak and seeing the error of his ways, bad man Jim wants to clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him off. While he is being lifted, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne marched right in the middle of a gunfire between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff. <br /> <br /> The Desert Trail is one of the milder John Wayne Westerns of Lone Star. Productions during this era. Remarkably absent is George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt. One or both are usually seen in these oats. However, if you are a John Wayne fan, you should see it once, but it will probably be enough.
