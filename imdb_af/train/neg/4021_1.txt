It's probably the worst movie ever made, it's just too bad, Roger Corman's name is associated with it. I could understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets, but nowadays there are no excuses to give this birth! I am a B-movie heater and from some people's point of view, all the movie I love is set aside by "regular viewers", but take my word on this one. Vampire Club makes the best of my list of the best of the worst. It's hard to imagine, vampires with no fangs, the music score is completely out of place, the sound effects are just not effective, and finally, S.avage didn't know he was in a vampire movie. Witch is too bad. because he had a "not too bad" career. Let me know I'm too hard on this one cause if I don't like a movie, I tend to forget about his good side.
