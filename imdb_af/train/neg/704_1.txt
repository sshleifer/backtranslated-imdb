A smooth romanticization of the sexual exploitation of New Orleans black women by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does it affect your appetite? Well, then, stomach up a VHS or DVD and divide this gratuitous troll by a seamy segment of history. For a good friend, it is adapted from the book by the famous hack Anne Rice. The direction is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheese dialogue. Most plays are amateurish. The production's only worth is that it has practically employed a dozen black actors. Everyone has hardly been employed in the contemporary market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that have not been seen at all. (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It is also, despite itself, an excellent showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is also on hand. So, late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent who owes his success, is joined by the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be considered 'T' for the test.
