What kind of documentary about a musician fails to include a single cut by the artist himself? Unlike Ray, or many other music artist films, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is the big song itself. Here are all the songs covered by uninteresting characters, and these versions fail to capture Cohen's slow, jazz-like style. More often, the cover is badly sung. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The interviews are so much more or less with other musicians and figures rather than with Cohen himself. Only the film function Cohen seldom reads his own work (never sings) - such as letters, poems, etc. The film didn't catch much on the artist's life story, nor on his development over the years. A big disappointment for a great Cohen fan.
