There is almost nothing to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice to watch and actually act, even though her role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre. In many movies like this one will shine through the material and make a note of them for future reference. No such luck here. Creation Unknown clicked monster-on-the-loose movie with kids beaten one after another. The monster is a man in a rubber suit who returns to Paul Blaisdell's days. The show is just as bad it is bad. A bit of humor can make it more palatable, but everyone plays the deadly dull material upright. There is a twist or two at the end, but then you will not care anymore.
