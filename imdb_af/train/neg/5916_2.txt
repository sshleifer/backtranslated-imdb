The turbulent slow rate of this movie was probably the director's explicit intention to tell how life was to grow up like a teenager in China. However, I found the combination of the glacier 'plot' and the general filming type is so impersonal that it is totally alienated, especially for a western audience. Sometimes I actually had trouble telling characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was completely over. As someone who is not only interested in music, but also much in China's history and culture (and thus is not a stranger to Chinese cinema), I could not engage with a single character and found nothing got to get my teeth. It asks the question: If I didn't like it, who on earth would have liked it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This unfortunate effort doesn't stop at all. I'm sorry to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.
