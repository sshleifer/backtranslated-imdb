Too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise it would get an easy zero. Actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, Peckenpah's name wasn't on the thing I'd never guess, he did it. Actually, one of the people in San Francisco I know a lot on the set and from almost to sunrise he said Sam just struggled. It shows in the kicks. The laugh in the early part of the movie is the only thing in this whole mess that is a second look. Not even Gig Young is viewable. It is a true test of masochism. If I was forced into a theater's boundary to see it, I would have jumped. And now I feel really guilty because I saw it all from a very comfortable sofa that was just too nice to go. What a mess, it seems less written than they did. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob spins backwards. Yikes !!!!!
