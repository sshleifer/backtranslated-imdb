We all asked ourselves, "Why don't they do the slasher movies that were just OK, instead of recalling those who were both good, so they could just make it better?" Well with Prom Night they made the average but trashy fun 80's Jamie Lee Curtis movie and even made it WORSE. It is a paint by numbers treasure film that clearly tries to attract the young teens (so no violence etc). The knife in this bumper is blunt. The director spends so much time trying to make the pretty attractive killer slightly creepy. that something else goes out of the window. The role players that include Britney Snow (which was excellent in Hairspray) are trying their hardest, but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and scare. Very annoying is how the dead scenes are handled (we'll hear the attack but don't see it). It also seems as if the only place where the knife worked in this movie was in the editing device, as the movie seems to have been slaughtered (I suspect anything that landed on the cutroom floor not to scare the kids) money from Americans sending this movie to number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are great fun, but in Prom Nights it dropped me the original. I've seen scary OC and Dawsons Creek episodes
