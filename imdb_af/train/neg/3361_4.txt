This movie was one of the best films ever made, "everything had to make a movie. Incredibly acting, wonderful special effects ..... oh wait to think of a good movie. Well, that was not one of them, it just sucked. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what kind of leg head would think this movie was a 10. When I threw my voice, there was 206 there Outside, God knows what's going on in them. Now, like any other voice, an 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10? Come on, what made this movie so good to give it a 10? I know it's the same 206 who thought Jean Claude Van Damme was a great dramatic actor.
