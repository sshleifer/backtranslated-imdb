I'll start it by saying I couldn't get through it all the time. I chose it on a rainy day from WalMart as the rest of the judges on this site. I thought there was no way I could regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only appropriate punishment I can think of to put something so bad. The shoot reminds me of the movies I made for class projects on a big old VHS camera. The acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some cool cameos. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. It's about as much of the plot as I understand. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Everyone came back and laughed and said, "Wow I didn't think I'd ever say I had an Adam Sandler movie in 15 minutes." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well now you can" <br /> <br />
