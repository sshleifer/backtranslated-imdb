My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Certainly in the top ten of those I looked through. At least, "Plan 9" was nice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other movies. I don't care much about "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad on versions I saw and I often couldn't say what people were saying) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in all possible ways. The "creatures" themselves are designed by a 9-year-old. (No offense to 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even the one-liners made us sound and were not just amusing.
