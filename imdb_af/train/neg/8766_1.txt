I have to say a warning all over and say the movie shouldn't be watched. It fails to be an appropriate tribute in such a wonderful way that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect was terrible, I didn't expect the director's total failure to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun that normally burns at the speed of 600 laps per minute burn at 1/10 speed? How can soldiers advance as a grenade before they explode? How can people survive when artillery shells fall as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells just on either side of the road and not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only did this lack of armor inspire me, it was the cleavage and the indifference of the dialogues that screamed me. There were the standard dialogues such as Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, the low math maro and Pakistan's jouaada musal moon after Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye m. Stupid to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote is true. The director worked without a script and showed it. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progress from one fight to another. It's just one shot after the next without any connection with the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are terrible. The head of the army personnel seems unconvincing. To make matters worse, the theater people cut impressive cut material to fit the four-hour movie in 3 hours.
