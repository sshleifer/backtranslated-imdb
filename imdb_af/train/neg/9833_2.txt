Falsely accused, John Wayne (like John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change identities to become Alias ​​Smith and Jones. Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler's supposed to be "Rev. Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". At no time is one of them as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; Although Wayne is considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career ways can be considered. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (like Anne), raised from her days in "Our Gang", is a great interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have some nice scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of low-budget John Wayne movies of the 1930s, this movie won't make you.
