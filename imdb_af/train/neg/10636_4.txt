I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately my hope was poured out! Nevertheless, we are led to believe that the KGB is a group of indecent morons who have no idea what they are doing. At one point there is a ridiculous scene where 4 KGB agents cannot handle one CIA agent. I get tired of this bias, one-sided and totally inaccurate depiction of the Spy game that took place during the Cold War. I find it nice that the US is unable to make objective films about their involvement in World War II and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we led to believe that the US got the Enigma machine, again, completely untrue. <br /> <br /> To his credit, "The Company" was very well filmed and performed. The localities are also well realized. Alfred Molina is a good show, just like Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to watch this show and I would definitely try the other 2 episodes, but I really hope that American productions will stop their spies, soldiers, and so on. Try to portray as super-men who are very intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet. It quickly and severely detracts from the likelihood of being a 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
