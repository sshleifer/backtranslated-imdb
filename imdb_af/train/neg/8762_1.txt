A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) finds out how to bring the dead back. But they come back with faces of marble. Eventually, they all lead to disaster. <br /> <br /> Drilling, totally predictable 1940 outing. It made me scary when I was a kid, but just bored me. I had to struggle to stay awake! With one exception, the play is terrible. Such expressionless boring actors! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things about this: Carradine, despite the writing, actually gives a very good performance. And there are some light, spectacular moments that include a ghost of great dune with walls. There is also one of the worst knockouts in movie history. Yet nothing of this is fun to put through. Avoid.
