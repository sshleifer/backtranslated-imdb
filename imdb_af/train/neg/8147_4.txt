This movie was a confusing piece of garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and for the most part they were completely uncontrollable except Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this movie, but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) it had to be an academic award. It was especially sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and tough movie. Life sank to new layers. Someone should make sure that this director never works in movies again. It was also supposed to be a horror movie because it was much more funny than scary. For Shame Life, For Shame.
