I do not recommend this movie because it is inaccurate and misleading. This story would be in the Algerian Berber area. This one was shot in the southern Tunisian desert. (I think I'm from Tunisia and Algeria). The other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt, speaking in the film with a very eloquent French academic academic academic academy while the character his play was supposed to be disturbed, never left her mountain kind of personality. Bedouin with that kind of education, I'm in that context impossible. The most scandalous and disrespectful scene, especially for the people of the region, is the "femme repudie" segment which is purely inventor / director's invention. Such things will never happen. An Algerian association ever !!!
