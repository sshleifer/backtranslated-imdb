"Washington Square" is a flat, detached adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James's masterpieces. In addition, it seems that its simple, uneventful story is indifferent to making it into a movie (although William Wyler, with his "The Heiress", in 1949 gave a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> In any case, the film forfeits the spirit of this great American author's work. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is ashamed, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, yet she is a good, intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as it may seem. Her attachment to her father is dignified and respectful, with no morphic sides in it. Along with three quarters of the movie, it seems that Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is mentally disabled, poor thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly becomes (and incredibly) intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman and everything. <br /> <br /> The director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nerve child, Catherine, does have problems with her vesica. The second scene, if we see in the background some kind of opencast, with prostitutes taking their clients behind tents, and so on. Nothing can conflict with Henry James' spiritual and artistic ideals. It is notorious that the author was extremely decent and demure, even for the standards of Victorian age. I testify to anyone to find any roughness in the thousands of pages of James's great literary production. I was really annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know a director needs some freedom in the screen customization of a novel. But if a director completely ignores or misunderstands the art of a writer (here Henry James), I don't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is enough for the movie: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a non-recommended movie.
