It's a very bad movie. But not as bad as its reputation. The production values ​​are not too bad and there is the odd effective scene. And it does have an 80-year-old fine profile which means it's always so nice. Also look out for Jimmy Nail's short look. His attempt at an American accent is so surprising that it is fantastic. Sybil Danning's breasts also have a short appearance, but the scene is repeated repeatedly in the final credits. It can only be described as the 12 "remix of Sybil Danning's boobs. It must be seen as believed. As a horror movie, it's not terrible, the consequences are stupid and Christopher Lee seems to be sleeping through his performance. He buys a new home and needs cash for the deposit The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so insignificant that I almost forgot all about them and I watched this movie earlier this evening. The werewolves are noticeably less impressive as in the original movie, actually, bizarre, they sometimes look more like badly burned monkeys.The European environment is pretty good and the music provided by the new wave group Babel is pretty terrible, but gives the movie at least a little cheese. <br /> <br /> Overall, good for a laugh, did you work, expecting it to be? And at least, you always had Sybil's whip.
