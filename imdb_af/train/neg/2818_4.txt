Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical, biblical-quoting archaeologist (William Finley) and draws the attention of a group of cults led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays the Sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. Genius is deceived by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), riding naked on a horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoke, leading to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman who oral sex simulates on a snake, an orgy and her father preaching in the background! Meanwhile, black cat cultures dissolve, sneak out eyeballs and slits. When Genie drugs slipped into her tea, she thought of the seeds hanging from a cross, a gold-colored woman in a leaf g-string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes. This is all because she is the revival of the lost love of the Seed. <br /> <br /> This typically thin Harry Alan Towers production is superfluous, seedy and reasonably senseless, but sets, costumes, cinematography, and place work are excellent and at least there's always something going on. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
