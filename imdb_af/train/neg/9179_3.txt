It's cheese. If all you want is a video game complete with what looks like straight-to-computer cutaway action sequences the movie is too cheap to actually make special effects, that's it. My friend and I actually had a nice time seeing it, as the theater was mostly empty and we could get a little. This movie actually requires hiccups. <br /> <br /> Plot? There was a plot? OK, some stupid colleagues or later types are invited to "the raven of the year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If they first stayed in Seattle they would have survived." - Direct quote, or almost .) to attend. They come there and everybody is gone, and the yard is somewhat ruined (but hey, the keg is still full!). With the help of a crunchy old captain and a coast guard (who just ran a little less - and slightly less good than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight many zombies (some spit), get an abundance of freaky legends and become mostly killed. That's about it. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad as Demonicus, but not much, and even better than Severed (it's kind of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun too heckle, and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a video game movie as good as Resident Evil, run! Now run! <br /> <br /> OK, some big questions (without too many spoilers): Since then, Spanish ships from the 18th century ventured northwards in the Pacific? Why is someone in the North West North West smuggling guns, and to whom - CANADA, crying out loud ??? Why is a raven on an unnamed (oh excuse, it is known as "isla del muerto", Shya, right) San Juan Island - and outside, still in mind, is the PACIFIC NORTHWET. And the ravens attended about 30 people - "the raven of the year," my shoots. <br /> <br /> Lucky thing there are many shutters about. Many of them. Everyone has them. Must be a greenhouse sale close by. <br /> <br /> Finally, while the movie started with a little "parody" (with nudges at I Know What You Did and Jaws), it didn't behave well enough. <br /> <br /> OK, really finally - when the introductory remarks (in a voice-over, no less) undoubtedly mention that one of the characters "gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fence" Be sure that there will be a few fences at the end of the movie. Not a good fence, but a few people who are bursting with swords anyway.
