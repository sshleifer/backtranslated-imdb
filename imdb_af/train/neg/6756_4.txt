Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival at this independent studio took place at a time when the budget and production values ​​were at their lowest in years. However, in his short career, Hamilton has established himself as a creative director who manages to make inventive and original stories. Now, it doesn't mean his movies are good, but at least it's different from the usual in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed", Hamilton offers a creative twist on the slasher sub genre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who eventually gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but she also seems to have found a boyfriend in Shaun (Danny Wolske). It seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after very sad events. Until a festival with Shaun's friends, they tell her that they have created a "club" where members should kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Obviously, they're joking, but Maddy desperately wants to kill someone. After that event, someone starts killing one of the members of the "club" one by one. it is up to Maddy to find out if someone can be the killer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character, played wonderfully by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is a very interesting turn on the genre to have the lead role as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little better. The movie sometimes feels pretty slow and overall the feeling is one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is strange in that all the female throws are very good. while the male throws painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wood and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. There is also a lot of nudity (both male and female) and the cast is very nice, so it's really a plus. <br /> <br /> The low budget hurt the movie in the effects section, as there are very few gory scenes and is not really graphical (probably because they would look bad); Nevertheless, seeing the budget, the movie looks at least good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's more recent effort, the Delta Delta Die!, is a better-crafted and overall fun movie. While this one is not as bad as other better-known movies, it's still a lot of mistakes and may just be interesting for fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent, non-budget movies. 10/04
