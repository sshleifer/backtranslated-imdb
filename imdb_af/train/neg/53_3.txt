I study Catalan and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art shop. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not so happy to see it. br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is well made and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it is well behaved and convincing. (For the most part, it is ... Will the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for the grave in the middle of the town square, in the full view of the 10-year-old son of the dead?) Oh, well .. small detail. Up to this point it had a sense of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, which was also in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident came from age. Francisca is a nun who works at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are both patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, like with so many Spanish movies (apology for Almodovar fans), is that the characters with one exception (Francisca) are just as * strange *. Their motivation, personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> What's more, it descends into a horrible miserable surplus. Be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood. The reviewer who called it a "pot boiler" is quite on the right track. If it was made 40 years ago, the poster would have said: see forbidden love !! RAPE !! MOORD !! Mutilation !! Fanaticism !! ANIMAL UNIT! Betrayal !! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence isn't nearly enough to make the characters' personalities and relationships credible. To work, it had to have several flashes to blot out the characters. As it is, it seems to be a bizarre and oppressive cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If it sounds like something you should see, enjoy it. I think I'm going with something that doesn't make me feel like I have to shower, to wash off the gore and darkness. <br /> <br /> As far as Catalan is concerned, it is the Mallorqui dialect, quite different from the Barcelona dialect, although I was surprised by the comments that even Barcelonaers believe require Catalan captions to understand it.
