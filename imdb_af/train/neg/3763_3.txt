A group of bushveld keepers and scientists enter the forest to find the fossils. They eventually hit a Bigfoot cemetery (it didn't see it in the dark). The scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are awful, but better than the endless scenes to speak that they seldom sign. I thought that only a good Bigfoot movie could be made. But now, after so many sad movies about the legend, I have serious doubts. To throw salt into the wound to watch this movie, the ONE pretty girl doesn't get naked once. And while this one might be better than Boggy Creek 2, it's still sad that the best non-documentary movie on Bigfoot "Harry and the Henriksons" remains. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
