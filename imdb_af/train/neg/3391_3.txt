I wonder who, more importantly, why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to manage the most simple sensation to hit Broadway in many years? He is an Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won Ghandi your moron! Jeremy Irons is an academy actor, do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musical. Really? "Oh, what a beautiful war you have forgotten?" To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not a us of the living energy survived the heavy handiness of the proceedings. Every character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their projection was theater. I didn't feel anything. But when I saw it on stage, I felt everything. The film must have been star, unknown, newcomers, but stars with compelling memorable faces, even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who can dance beautifully. Well, Michael Douglas was in it. True I forgot I was completely wrong and you were completely right. Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical.
