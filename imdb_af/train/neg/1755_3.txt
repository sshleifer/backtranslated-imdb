This film is not without charm and also shows some warmth, but ultimately this effort is in vain and too focused on the lead. There is no doubt Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time, but she takes too much of the spotlight away from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the overload of clich√©s writing. The daughter who secretly falls from college, an elderly woman who finds it difficult to get a good job (and ends up with rather humiliating work), the messy network executive with his executive toys shining over go, the journalist who sticks to her beliefs, etc. There is nothing really wrong with any of these, ie they are all really rooted, but in combination they are just too much and we leave too many deja-vu and too few surprises.
