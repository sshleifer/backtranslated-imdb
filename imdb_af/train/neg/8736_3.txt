The movie had a good concept, but the performance just didn't succeed. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, story-wise, it's "Dirty Harry", meets "M". A child killer started terrorizing a city. The chief detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never handled a series of murderers. The mayor and the police chief, in despair, secretly hire the local gang to speed things up ... to go places and do things that the police will not be able to do to end this mess as soon as possible no. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie really has good things to offer. <br /> <br /> Apart from the concept, I kept the look of the murderer's hiding place. Norman Bates has his cellar. This man has a terrible sewer. In some of the shots, the light jumps off the water and creates wrinkling reflection on the walls; These screens often give a creepy, dream-like quality. <br /> <br /> The play was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of the actors who get better with age. <br /> <br /> However, as soon as you are over, it will decrease more or less. <br /> <br /> The movie is playing too fast. The real investigation process of both teams feels very rushed, rather than feeling complicated and fascinating. It can be determined in two ways: make the movie longer or cut some of the many subplots. One of these would have allowed the crew to spend more time on the real riddle. <br /> <br /> For an example of how bad it is, one of the key clues that help them zero is just the right suspect: at one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop. ... that's right ... I'm here really serious. This is as they went from point A (the first clue) to show the Z (the suspect) and beat all the intervening steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only thing I actually liked was two pickpockets that you met halfway through the movie. Since they are small characters, I call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the shoe corner. This is the one that gets me the most, which is why I bought the $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! In the last 10-15 years there has been an absolute flute of serial killers. The gang angle was a gimmick that could help it, but it didn't. <br /> <br /> I thought the gangsters' methods would be brutal, but fun and exciting at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they'll even throw some heist movie elements. After all, we're talking about criminals. Instead, we are given the most repulsive protagonists dedicated to celluloid. The detectives are asking witnesses. What do the crowd do? They questioned and killed them. It's not even like these witnesses are really even so bad. I actually found the criminals that are less enjoyable than the murderers they hunt. <br /> <br /> Unless the good points I've mentioned are enough to get your interest, I want to say, give this one a miss. Maybe someday, they will reuse the same story idea and do it right. I hope so. I hate to see such a good concept going to waste.
