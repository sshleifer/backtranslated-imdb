The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old distorted witch who lures children to her home to get a prize for their loose tooth and then take their lives. The first few minutes announce you at the beginning of the 1949 Dental Feast and then switch to the current day. The worn horror plot is reasonably saved by the solid acting. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and some other scenes, but overall the gore screens were bloody but fast which had a minimizing effect. The eye cake is pretty good for both sexes. Camera work is good. Dialogue is fair, but cheesy. I expected the movie to be a bare butter, a low budget, a shoemaker with very few redeeming factors. I was amazed at the quality of the film.
