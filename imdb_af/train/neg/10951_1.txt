I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was horrible! I actually looked at the whole thing, just because I couldn't believe someone would make such a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are without depth and there is no attempt to give any kind of atmosphere with music or sound effects. If you also decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this movie, make sure you throw something, because cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand camera and half the time you can't even do not. see the majors. This style is much more successful in using movies like "Blair Witch" because it creates tension. In Rosetta there is no plot and no tension that the style will lend to. I should have known better if it happened at 2am in the morning that it would be terrible.
