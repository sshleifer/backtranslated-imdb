Almost a two-player game, and the dialogue and the actions of the leaders will be important. Not very good either. It might have been stronger if it was first produced as a two-game game, and then worked in a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a winding vampire that looks slightly autistic becomes confused with a stripper (because of too much porn in his crappy home). He wants her to tell him about the daylight. He would have been better off finding someone with a day job, or someone who would like to paint a picture with words like a poet, but they might not have a warm bid. <br /> <br /> After getting her, doing what he wants (and he's not very good at it), he plans to feed her at six o'clock, at what point the sun rises. Much of the deadline is made, despite the fact that he also says he can go without nutrition, it will only make him hungry. In addition, he claims he can't let the stripper go because she knows about him, but he does let some other people learn what he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why this vampire prefers to live in a home so poorly piled up that street light and neighboring buildings light up as if it were day, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, you'd think he'd done a better job or fix the place a bit. He is clearly not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of this Dance of the Lost. Though directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II), it was pretty bad.
