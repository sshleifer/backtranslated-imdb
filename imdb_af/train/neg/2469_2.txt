I think if you like the endless dialogue that doesn't surrender the story and flashing camera effects like the theatrical passage in the television program _Angel_, you'll enjoy the movie. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it wasn't there. The pacing was virtually backward, plots were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear or tension, or anything. <br /> <br /> Is this the redneck? Is this the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman at speed. It's not scary. It does not generate a single tension or atmosphere unless you are afraid of MTV. Like the judges in front of me, I also noticed that the film, in the end, watched the audience. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie.
