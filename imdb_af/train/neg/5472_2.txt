All day long, I watch dinosaurs, and all day they had the same fundamental problem. <br /> <br /> They don't believe in firearms. They just don't look at them or anything. Bullets _bounce_ off dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they died millions of years before the outbreak of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different from ... Aah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to operate chemically today, they must be vulnerable to rapid (even subsonic) main projectiles. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> Look, the toughest honed reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are totally vulnerable to basic gunfire. They are nothing magic. You can shoot a gun round through the heavy scales on their back. They do not take weapon arrows or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them. Something (but not really) big bullets is preferred because the challenge (like most games) kills the animal with one shot, so it doesn't. (Hunters consider it immoral to run down and die.) <br /> <br /> Most animals, including predators, are easily driven by gun fire. Between the noise, and the pain of even a non-lethal wound, most will run away. An exception is great bears, which are so fearless that they just get angry with mortal wounds. Cape buffalo are considered highly dangerous because they are known to lift when wounded. We watched video of the big bulls of a herd of cape-buffalo who rescue a calf from a whole lion's lion. A big cat will run if it can, but if it can't, it will be a final act of despair. Where a T.Rex fits in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior has simply not been met. With these larger animals, safe hunting is used to apply an appropriate large and powerful projectile, and / or to bring several of them fast enough to prevent the charge. Of course, with a T.Rex it can be a serious problem. I saw a T.Rex skull (they have one in the center of the museum) and have a gun big enough to bust that may be impractical. Chewing off his neck with much smaller fire could be a more viable approach. Small bullets will still penetrate them, they will not only bounce, just because the animal is too big to kill easily! <br /> <br /> Here we have Cortez and his men (that is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign, apparently) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. It seems that all those human sacrifices about the blood of the few T.Rexes who terrorize the continent in that day have been proclaimed. Rather than just cutting out their hearts and feeding on the lizards, Cortez et al talks to the Aztecs to have them hunt and kill. OK, maybe they don't have M-16s like the guys in the Carnosaur series, but they have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big, trees) and swords. Perhaps it is a bit less unequal than groups of soldiers with full cars, but they have several guys and I will quickly cross them over a dinosaur. Oh, wait, there's an _annon, over a 4-ink. It's just the ticket to break a Tyrannosaurus skull! So they lie in a trap, with a group of men, cannons, nails in a gorge and attracting the first T.Rex in it, with a nice brown girl as bait. Cortez points out that they will NOT have time to recharge, so they must close the series until they can be sure of their goal. T.Rex completely ignores their volley flintlock fire, and we both see a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannonball _bounce_ off! Forget about it. End credibility. A crossbow bolt will defeat Cortez's torso armor, and a 4-gun ball can penetrate the trunk of a wooden boat! It will surely go through the shelter, rib cage or skull of any animal to run this planet. think an _whale_ can withstand a 4 "cannon ball?) And here is still T.Rex, not even bleeding, so Cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls on the pointed sticks, which guess) it penetrates and kills. Yaaay, pointed sticks! <br /> <br /> The dinos aren't quite indisputable for gunfire - they manage to catch the second one with a pistol. off, so it's not as common as a bear or buffalo, at least in the movies. <br /> <br /> They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd full of gunpowder and Gems: My money will still be on the cannon, it's manipulated is to concentrate all the powder's energy in one direction - to the target. A bomb is a much more diffuse application of force. NOT a gourd bomb) has a steel casing that contains the explosion to extremely high pressure (think: pipe bomb vs fireworks.) A stack of gunpowder fired simply goes up. Trust me on that one.)
