This movie is weak. The box cover says east LA's toughest gang and it's really Santa Ana's. James Cahill acts like a cash queen who takes down all the tough guys in the tough Chlo gang. It's fake, boring, senseless and limp, I tried to get my money back from the video store. This movie was so bad. It was also at the homo-erotic point far from what the video box proclaims. James Cahill must be in Gay Porn. James is in every scene, he can't act to save his life. The movie contains Eva Longoria who is hot, but James can't agree with her score !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt I watched Gay Porn and turned off the whole movie. James clearly wants to be with men, but rather submits to his gay desires, and he goes back and forth on gangsters. His martial arts skills are at best minimal. Some real gangsters will take him and his poor skills and drive him a new one.
