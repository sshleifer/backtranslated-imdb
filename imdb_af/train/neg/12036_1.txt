I wasn't sure I had to laugh or cry. Porretta was looking well, but looked like a Mexican pornstar, not an English ban. costumes? what costumes? A T-shirt with stripes of black leather on it. It was Marion's clothes - or lack of them - that really got me. really do the "fans" of this stinker really believe women dressed in medieval England. The Mongols and Vikings were inaccurate and stupid, but the episode with a stranger was the worst of all. Especially because his makeup consisted mainly of oatmeal on his face - an old trick. The hedgehog sample was pretty funny, like climbing the side of a castle on an arrow, as if. The American accents sharpened like the initial screaming voice over 'RAW-bin Hood and LIDDLE John'.
