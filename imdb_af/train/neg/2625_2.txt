This film was terribly performed, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. This is SEMI viewable. <br /> <br /> The storyline (which is few) makes almost no sense. The Barney Drum character is the only true comic relief in the movie and it gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many Canadian supporting role-players can be found in TV ads. None of them have any other way I am aware. And of course, Sly Stallone's even less talented brother, well ..... = <br /> <br /> Trivia: It's almost completely filmed in and around the village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles north of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks / crossings / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed at the newly demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was demolished.
