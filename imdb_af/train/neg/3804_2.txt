It is a poor movie by any standard. The story in Match Point had a certain plot, and the direction and writing of a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixes his own culture with that of the classic English murder and investigation that can be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, has none of this. It's poorly written, the two leads are hopeless wood and the story itself doesn't matter at all. The genre that spoils it requires at least some subplot with a spectacular explanation and bindings (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in closed rooms?). <br /> <br /> Allen's beautiful and witty versions of several Hollywood genres (curse of the Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us great pleasure this year. Even Hollywood Ending had a good central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
