If you haven't lived in the 90's, or don't listen to rapper ever !! This movie might be good for you, but any fan or anybody who ever listened to this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said it was interesting or I didn't know. Another thing that made me bow down like anything in his life he did, was very easy, there was no fight he made, made jail easy, sold drugs, and even that was not realistic. I think if the movie where it was released in about 15 years might have more of an impact! good rap movies print and flow, get rich or die, try not to be infamous
