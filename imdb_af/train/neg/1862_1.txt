It's not just the plot alone, which makes this movie an immediate turn off for bored audiences. This is the terrible direction with a terrible writing and mistakes left and right, which also makes it too painful to watch. I'm sorry, but I don't see the 'fun' in it. Just the excitement to show the many bugs and stupid one-liners. Well, I wonder how stupid the directors of their manufacturer think when this movie was first introduced. Probably as stupid as the sheriff who dives into the bowl full of freezing with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to call this sheriff not only a poor actor, but can also take an impalement with a load of antifreeze watering the exposed flesh? I think he forgot a lot when he won a non-exciting victory over the snowman.
