This Italian semi-horror movie begins much like a soft-core porn movie and becomes a mystery that has some to many loose points to be good. This and the fact that it's pretty boring makes this movie rather unpleasant for my taste. . The only thing worth watching is the many boobs that are being distributed by the movie. The story has a man who, at the beginning of the movie, attracts girls to his castle where he continues to take them to his dungeon, go to bed and seem to kill them. They show the nudity, but they never show the murders at this stage in the movie. Then the man finds a nice red head at a party and continues to make out with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads you see, as his beloved former wife, Evelyn, was also one. She also died under circumstances that should not have been the viewer's business. After many scenes, murders begin with snakes, dragons and so on. At this point it is easy enough to find out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is, then you have a nonsense end where everything doesn't look so good. This movie just didn't work for me, it left me many questions and the last third of the movie just didn't have the boobs of the first two thirds of the movie. Explanation of Evelyn's death would have helped the film, because it would be a kind of end where Evelyn had risen from the grave. Granted the title is not entirely misleading, because she left the kind of grave, but not under her own power. The gore is for the most part very light, as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood. I just thought the movie was a bit dull.
