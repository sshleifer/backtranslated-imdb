I hung all the way through this movie. First, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood was trying to create a kind of comedy car hunt movie. Imagine, "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Don't take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and stealing of his body is only used as a springboard for a low budget hunting movie, a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the Parsons legacy and his fans base. Gram's father died long ago in 1973, the other world characters are fictitious. None of this has nothing to do with Gram's life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I encourage you not to see this movie. I wish I didn't. It is sad to see that something special is treated as such shameful food. I swear I could turn Gram into his grave while the movie was playing. If you don't know Gram's life and legacy, nothing in this movie should be representative of Gram. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram was alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. Then again, maybe he would be scared if he knew this movie would be.
