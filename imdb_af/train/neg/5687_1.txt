Although it's not as bad as its game-to-movie adaptations, this time doesn't go much better. <br /> <br /> Boll has a pathological inability to assume he doesn't make good movies. One of these days he runs out of money and stops to cause the world with his bombs. <br /> <br /> The play was sublime, the dialogue sounded like they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll's special little "touch", <br /> <br /> Like all of your Boll movies, this one should not exist. <br /> <br /> Simply and simply. <br /> <br /> Like Uwe Boll himself shouldn't exist. > _>
