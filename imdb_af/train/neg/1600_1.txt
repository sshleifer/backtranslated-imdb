The biggest National Lampoon hit remains "Animal House", and rightly so. It was funny, raucous and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of every other National Lampoon movie. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or because John Hughes wrote this mess. This reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> One star and generous. Then I always thought most of my old classmates were also demons, vampires and serial killers.
