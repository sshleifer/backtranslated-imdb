I'm the director's cousin. It took me years to get my hands on a copy of this movie and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle no longer has a copy of it (I asked). I look forward to bringing him a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently, the movie's average rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, it should place somewhere in the mid 30's in the IMDb "bottom 100", but with only 206 votes, it's not yet posted. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the movie doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this year I give copies of the movie to family members for holiday pay. Best / Worst Gift Ever?
