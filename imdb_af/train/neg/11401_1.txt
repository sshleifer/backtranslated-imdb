The script was very poor without enough character bows to give you a little bit of characters or what happened to them. The writing is far too talky and not enough gore or action to call it even slow. The story comes to the point that you just want everyone to shut down and die as fast as possible so you don't have to listen, talk this very muted, tight dialogue. On a technical note, the music mix is ​​too high and makes it difficult to understand what is being said the most. Then it can be called a blessing again. Overall, the same story could be better said in a short movie with a running time under 30 minutes. The obvious "in your face" is a joy to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good if they were more subtle, but here they look more like a bare-faced rip. C'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and that's the best that can be done? However, cinematography, lighting design and shots are indeed well done.
