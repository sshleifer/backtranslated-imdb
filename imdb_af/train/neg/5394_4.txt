I get annoyed with the modern shakespeare adjustments when the director can't imagine whether the original should be used or updated. If it uses the original words in an updated environment, it is particularly difficult if it is set in the 20th or 21st century, although it can work well in periods, eg. The Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night, which is late Victorian very effective. It can work with the 30-year-old institution if there was just a lot less of the song and dance and much more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it just ends a pretty trivial but very pleasant performance. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I think he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is such an experienced Shakespeare actor who, despite all his efforts to be just another student, shows his play all the time. Of course, he had to have played the King - no problem surrounding a mature student with King by younger students. Instead, we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the king, so a so-called King without royal attributes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the amount of song and dance I found, despite the beautiful songs and dancing well enough, meant that the huge Shakespeare dialogue had to be drastically reduced. So the whole thing ends up a trivial and soft steak, and I got very bored, including the comic twists, and was happy when it ended. Branagh did not do the Shakespeare justice in this production. <br /> <br /> Again, to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely beautiful as the older couple.
