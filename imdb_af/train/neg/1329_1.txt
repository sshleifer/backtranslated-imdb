This movie is AWFUL. I didn't laugh so much for a movie that was inadvertently funny in a long time. Leno should have held on to stand up and leave night television. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie in itself is the stupid movie I've ever seen. It's pathetic, the acting is terrible, and the plot can be written by a 4-year-old. don't understand me, jay leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
