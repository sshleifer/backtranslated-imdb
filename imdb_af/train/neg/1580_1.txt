It has become a cult film in Chinese students, but I didn't see it until it was broadcast in Channel4, the UK. <br /> <br /> Full of artistic predictions, the plot is mediocre and unreal; The "spirit" it wants to convey is how independent artists resist the commercialization of the music industry and maintain their "purity of an artistic soul" and not sell it for dirty money. it is really sloppy and superficial; The diologist is mainly pathetic. acting is poor. Sceenplay is full of art pretense. It's a fantasy movie for kids and that's all <br /> <br />
