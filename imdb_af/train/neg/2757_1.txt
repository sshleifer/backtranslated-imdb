I'm a man who loves parenting movies ... I'm looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with a cool special effect. All these things happened, but this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the depiction of the story was terrible. The scene passage was the worst I have ever seen. Why run out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The snake dragon's actions themselves were very poorly written ... and the snake dragon's attack abilities varied widely in the film, several times the main characters had to be dead. <br /> <br /> The director tried to fill in a love story. Of course, the center of the movie during the most stressful times was not watched after it was made. I love movies, but had to force myself to watch it. Thanks, I didn't buy it, I borrowed it from a friend. . <br /> <br /> Don't buy it, don't rent, just watch discovery channel ... much more exciting.
