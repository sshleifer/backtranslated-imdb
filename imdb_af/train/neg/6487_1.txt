Well, thank you so much Disney for unleashing the good memories I used of my former favorite movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember watching. So, now I'm 16, and I feel masochistically enough, I decided to rent this movie. So I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie. In this movie, Ariel and Eric take the birth of their daughter, Melody, and show her to look at her. everyone in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the music number ends, within minutes, the sea witch Morgana appears and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. So, he gives it without a fight. Eric is yawning there, though Ariel finds out how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea before Morgana is caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... nothing, nothing really happens. Eric is a total wuss. He never really manages anything. Ariel kind of something. Melody controls things to screw. Plus, the animation is a new low point for Disney. The computer graphics clash with the backgrounds. Any opportunity for character development has been wasted. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, don't waste your time. I'm pretty sure even the little ones will get bored with them right away, since nothing even happens to be exciting. They will not want to sing the songs. If you manage to grab a copy of it, throw it out into the sea and hope that no one ever finds it. Ever.
