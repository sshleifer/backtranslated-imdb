Germans think smirking is funny (just as Americans think mumbling is sexy and women are acting with English accents). I had to cross my eyes when the screen was filled with a huge close-up of a face. One of those housewives runs a corporate corporate headquarters where she cheats a bank by typing a few random keys on her home computer, which only connects to a power outlet. The director obviously loves the rather big front lady. Can't say I share his feelings. There is quite a funny bit when the whole family is sitting in front of the television, in vain with the ads. Apparently this review should be one line longer, so here it is.
