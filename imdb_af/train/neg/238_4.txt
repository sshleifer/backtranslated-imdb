A Cinderella story made for adults living in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, it's definitely your movie, but for the rest of our real world people, I encourage you to save your three-hour waiting time. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who watched the movie with me will not recommend the movie. We had a good time to prevent the majority of unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something. I just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!
