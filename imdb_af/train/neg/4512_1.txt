After a few years in Japan, this movie does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come closer to explaining what a Geisha is about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity was missed to bring the Japanese culture closer to the broader Western audience and to help demystify the country where Zen, Samurai, the Kyoto Geisha world comes from. Some of the most beautiful moments of the movie are when Americans are shown in the Japanese environment. The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was way too much use of Chinese music. A small but essential detail: the correct use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscure kitschy! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
