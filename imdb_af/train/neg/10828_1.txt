It's not just my judgment on this movie, but also the bulk of what has been written about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like "police academy 9" or whatever I enjoy more than my fair share of the high forehead or artificial things, I swear. <br /> <br /> 'Magnolia' is poor, and I'm honestly concerned about why it seems to have been so. Long winds, self-indulgent, turbulent nonsense from start to finish, there is just as little credibility that people love so much for the movie. There are some high caliber actors fair enough, and no one turns into an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self-confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me this is his best performance by far. But the plot is so completely inconsistent, among the stories of several snapped-up characters with such a snail's pace that even when meaningful life-changing events are portrayed, it seems to be useless and uninteresting, you find yourself crying out for someone who inflated or something. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that any of the characters is very easy to identify or empathize. Well, I didn't think so, but I don't like most people. They all play their unconditional life stories on a large scale and show their character errors and emotions in so many intricate details and play their deep and meaningful relationships to the ninth grade with lots of waffle soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also so bad, with the marrow-sucking annoying quality I have so far thought to be unique to Alanis Morisette's music. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was so nice to be forced to be forced three hours. Repeatedly look at an episode of "Friends" as they are constantly torn in the ribs by a disgruntled nannybok. The little with the frogs is good.
