In a way, it is the disaster that Fellini has worked for his entire life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and the free association bullshit is very small, and which category a movie will eventually fit will often only depend on personal feelings. It said, "Casanova" left me in the cold admiration for his sets and still little that can no longer be summed up by Bukowski. <br /> <br /> "Casanova died, just an old man with a big cock and a long tongue and no intestines. To say he lived well is true, to say that I Spit on his grave without feeling is also true, the ladies usually go to the biggest fool they can find where it happens today: we have the clever and lasting Casanova, all hollow, like the Easter bunnies we promoting our poor children, breeding them. "<br /> <br /> As far as I can tell, this is the position Fellini has about his subject; desired, with more empathy, but nevertheless confused. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made of decay and turbulent behavior, themes that Fellini has dealt with in the "Satyricon". The sequence of plot is characteristic of soft porn, just without the context; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> However, there may be just a point to portray Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge someone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini couldn't. More than ever, he looks like a dirty old man - a maestro, but the one whose impulses satisfy him more than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine an audience enjoying this movie. It wasn't worth telling.
