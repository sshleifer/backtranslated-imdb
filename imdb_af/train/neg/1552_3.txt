This film is very well advertised. I am a keen filmmaker and have been watching previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat skeptical about how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it would be great and make me think about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sinking in my seat, and almost fell asleep until I remembered paying for this movie. I laughed at most of the things in the movie, just like, I didn't want to feel bad and the good mood I was destroying, plus I wanted to make my money out of the movie! I always go in a movie with an open mind, and try not to expect too many expectations, but this movie wasn't that funny. Now it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you haven't seen a lot of movies for the movie, or you like very slow and funny comedies, you can enjoy it but for real comedy fancies, say Id, succeed. Maybe even look at the Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to see. Meet the parents earlier!
