Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie, but prom night is much better and this movies about how the prom Queen Mary Lou was murdered by her boyfriend in 1957 and returned 30 years later for revenge. The best actor in this movie is Micheal Ironside and movie stars other OK actors and actresses such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good gore scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl trying to hide in her locker room. the safes collapse and how one of the students is on the computer and Mary Lou shoots him. All this is an OK / good horror movie and my score is 4 out of 10.
