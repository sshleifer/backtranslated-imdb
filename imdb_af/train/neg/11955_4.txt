"Visitor Q" is a failed black comedy attempt that focuses on what the world's most dysfunctional family can be, including physical abuse of abuse to give necrophilic murder of blood scans to a lactating mother who nurses her husband and adult daughter . film is so outrageous that it deserves critical acclaim and follows a small cult. But with home video quality and a slapdash production, "Visitor Q" doesn't just like curiosity. Gender targets are blurred and sanitary devices are clearly visible, makeup is awful and everything is amateurish at its best. Wasting time. (C-)
