I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I love almost every British sitcom (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them I didn't understand.) But this Lord's League is just something good for you sick. This show was somehow good; it helped me lose some weight because I watched this piece of garbage, let me feel I'm not hungry anymore. It's actually just disgusting, sick and not even funny TV program and I wonder who actually laughs at these things. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting, watching men wearing the yellow teeth in the woman climbing on the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about it? It makes me falter. No humor, just photos and cheap disturbances, toilet laughs ... I don't know ... if you like these things ... you go ahead ... watch it ... but to be honest, people are watching and enjoy it should have emotional problems. Garbage.
