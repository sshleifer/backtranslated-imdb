Editor in chief: Back to minors (1998) Â½ * <br /> <br /> With: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes PG-13 (for language and some violence) <br /> <br /> At Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, in the new John Warren comedy "GREAT LEAGUE: BACK TO LESS" is there a funny scene. It consists of a sequence in which an angry coach just throws a baseball hard in the wall behind him to hit the cement and jump back and face him. It's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, it's all this movie to offer. Enough said. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only structured, typically undeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but also bad. Even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with everything they got. It's so well known that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times should the same movie be made about sports? Last year we saw the same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver", and as bad as the movie was, it's even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major League Back to Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to see together on a Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Teenagers? Elderly? People who are so desperate for entertainment will they rent something like that? <br /> <br /> The movie, like many others like this one, has one basic point that tries to make it: teamwork takes everyone. Yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove. Too bad we have seen so many times and singled out so many times so much talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. Where the silly announcers form their own "buddy comedy routine," they mumble one linen for themselves like "They suck," "These kids' quick ball is thrown with an hour glass." "This man went out of the ball for a while to find something lost - maybe it was his thought," "Someone needs a nap," and "see another sunset as beautiful as that play." Where the characters so little interest in each other that we never know them by name. And where the only sad lecture about teamwork is so ignorant that it's almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Major League Back to Minors" is so bad; this stall ends its trite right in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is returning, they are winning and - the power goes out. For a moment I thought that this piece of garbage came to a conclusion, but in reality, its fake final scene just exists minutes after the current time. The movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw so many pests jokes it's not funny. There is another kind of funny dialogue that a coach and player have that talk to each other about why a long timer is no longer required in that position. The coach's answer: "You are too old, too slow, and too fat." The player's response is to die. But that scene definitely doesn't make this movie worthy of your time and is definitely not worth a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> So here is another terrible predecessor in this genre of movie, another that is doomed with its own writing, which has previously failed, and another that is so familiar looks like the deja vu again. <br /> <br />
