The original book was set in the 1950s, but it won't do for the TV series, as most people look at the 1930s style. Ironically, the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train, so the Underground can also play at that game. The story of a plot over the Jarrow March depends, but the 50 version had students who started thinking about the world around them, so I think they are thinking about the poverty of the marchers, is very similar. All the things Japp had to take care of for himself were also weak, but they had to put something in place to fill the time. It would have made a decent half-hour show, or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long shot. Obviously this episode is a victim of style over content.
