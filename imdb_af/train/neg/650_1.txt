Why Hollywood feels it is necessary to refine such brilliant movies is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, but is much worse why Hollywood has the need to remember those horror movies that are not brilliant. was not. Night, The Amityville Horror). Much like their originals, these remakes fail to create atmosphere, character or any real scares. Prom Night is so flat and uninteresting, it's hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It is a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately boring outing that fails to do everything she designed. Clearly, Hollywood Horror is dead. Even The Hills Has Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's likes to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. Prom night is virtually bloodless and I'm not even going to say how bad the plot is. The inability to seal the killers seal makes it the least exciting horror movie ever since erm ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s is returning to terrorize moviegoers with these remakes that just show how frightening high school dances can be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) survived a terrible tragedy, but now is the time to leave the past and celebrate her senior prom in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school star by educating and dawning. But while Donna is willing to look at her nightmares and in a better future, the man she thought had escaped forever returned for one last dance. An obsession killer is asleep, and he will kill someone who is trying to prevent him from reaching his only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see graduation day, and what will Donna do if she's forced to confront her biggest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis co-star in the abrasive repairman who will wear tuxedo-dressed teens all over their shoulders while pouring on the dance floor. A plot that you will probably leave is going to see it. Witch if you ask me is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much to work with, McCormick tries to gamely gamble out the most banal situations. At one point, a girl goes back into a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump it into a jump-start moment. Desperate times are really desperate measures. There have not been so many shots since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and a Predator, there is probably a terrible and horrible movie to be exploited from the commoditization of shine and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty. . It's not that movie. <br /> <br /> My Final Judgment? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will love Prom Night, it's even a disappointment to those who usually enjoy hack-job remakes. Considering his absolute lack of blood or fear. You'll be in a hurry to forget a night.
