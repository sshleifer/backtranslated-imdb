I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most reasoning factor to own the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My voice for this movie is a big fat NEWS. Don't misunderstand me, I'm a horror girl. but I want a little meat behind the story, not to mention, I prefer the evil to happen to people, not to deceive to look at, that looks forever, cuts of snuff. Acts of cruelty interrupt laboriously long silence and poor acting. If I was forced to make a comparison with another movie, the only one who heads up is the Canonical Holocaust. Bad, boring, useless and a totally uncomfortable watch.
