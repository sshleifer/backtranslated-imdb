This redesign of Tim Burton from the original "Planet of the Apes" of 1968 (starring Charleton Heston) is far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but did not write. The characters were boring and the dialogue was terrible. Throughout the film I sat with a friend (who thankfully just rented it) and completely understood why, before Christmas, all the "Planet of the Apes" toys at Target were in the sink. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Don't post it on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone: look at the original 1968 Planet of the Apes movie.
