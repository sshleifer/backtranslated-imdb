Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will be as easy as Goodfellas in Miss. Congeniality sucked ... but this movie? It does not make sense !! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of unbelief not to make sense. Why does her family live in England? Or, at least, why doesn't she have a British accent? She is probably happy with her father and he surprisingly surprised that she hasn't been around for the past two years. (No one ever made much of an agreement that she was away so long). And what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to come to the fact that the accompaniment she paid fell in love with her - it could be overcome by better movies. I'm just saying that the characters, the environment and the plot aren't enough to make an equally coherent story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unobtrusive corners on Debora Brass's nose. I argued the filmmakers if I was her! I mean honestly, I'm all because women are who they are, but why have I never noticed how incredibly strange she and Will are in seven loyal years of Will and Grace? Oh! Because those producers are friendly to her! This movie, like my least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> It gets my voice easy as one of the worst movies I've ever missed. I'm just glad a friend borrowed me her DVD, so I've lost time. If there was a way to make this review, I'd do it.
