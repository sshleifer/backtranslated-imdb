This is surely one comedy that I probably won't forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Normally, it wouldn't bother to comment on this movie: it's so small that no one will see it anyway, but as it does, it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks like Kazaa, and so this seed production must be exposed to what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it? Well, of course it's not a comedy; Instead, it is meant as a horror flick - "meant" a lot to be the keyword here. The script is a completely disjointed and unbalanced mess, the special effects are only special because they are especially pathetic. And as for the acting, let's just say that if it were my primary school, my teachers would have erupted from our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I realize it's a very low budget film and that in such cases, one should lower one's expectations, especially in terms of special effects. Even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these movies are rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top acting. <br /> <br /> But still. /> <br /> B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding, such as humor. The only laugh in Cradle to Fear lies in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humor through it - and then I can dip the first 20 minutes right away - then it will be the only thing that offers the movie. Oh, it and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it does not even mean that it does not attempt to convey anything: The victims also use drugs and / or are involved in serious crime. The lesson: Be out, naughty boys and girls, because someday you'll be paid for what you did. <br /> <br /> I rest my case. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a little sex, a good amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock'n roll. <br /> <br /> I rate this one out of 10, but will go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I don't want: it deserves to play the names of the actors correctly in the titles. I mean, that's something?
