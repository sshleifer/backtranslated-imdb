I just came back from "El Otro" here in Buenos Aires and I have to say I was very disappointed. The movie is moving very slowly (don't get me wrong, I enjoy slow moving movies!), Slow to the point of making you crazy. All you hear is Julio Chavez's breathing heavy through the whole movie. It's a bad movie, but more importantly, it's a film without inspiration, I didn't feel anything for the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" is made only for the sake of making a movie ... make it forgetful. I would recommend passing this one on if you want to see good Argentine movies, watch movies by Sorin.
