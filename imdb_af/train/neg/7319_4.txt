When you get to the scenes that Albert Brooks takes without his shirt ... try not to knock on a fur ball. <br /> <br /> I love Albert Brooks. I saw the most, if not all of his movies, but that was the first time I saw it. Modern Romance is an interesting approach to the subject of love. There are few movies that deal with the despair of love, as well as openly as Modern Romance, though 1979's Chilly Scenes or Winter come close. They both essentially have obsessed men who are too psychologically attracted / obsessed with their respective women. <br /> <br /> Where-like Cold Scenes Winter Borders stalking on the subject, this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and out of the relationship .. and back in this weather. <br /> <br /> And being a movie released in 1981, it is of its time in terms of styles and so on. That's the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is: "If it sucks, it may have historical relevance." You know timepieces. <br /> <br /> What leads me to the terrible scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt. <br /> <br /> The man is hair. Many hair. As he wears a black curly furry jersey. And what's worse is that he almost looks, victim-hairy. It's not a pleasant sight and the screens with him without a shirt go on and on. Back in the early 80's, hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, the appearance of such a thing is just rebellious. Sorry, Albert! I wish someone at some point said, "Hello, let's try this scene, but wearing a simple t-shirt means you can scare people." It's just really bad and I feel sorry for the poor, beautiful actress who had to go with Albert Brooks naked body on top of her. She probably pulled his hair out of her teeth a few days later. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an OK movie. It might have been better if I didn't see Albert Brooks without his shirt, because what looks like 10 long consecutive minutes, because it will forever hide my performance from this movie.
