Why else would he do it for me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expected Dean Cain to produce hit flags. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how ... "good" dean Cain is. Obviously it will be a cheese spot, and each cheese spot has its own special way of making you scratch your head. I won't call these spoilers, because you can no longer spoil this movie any more than it already is. <br /> <br /> To start with ... why is it a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How did that one scientist from Chicago and the other scientist be from LA and no one could be more Eastern European if they tried? How difficult would it have been to either get an American actor or just change the lame state sheet that made the film tell us that people aren't Americans? <br /> <br /> Why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a snail line? We get helipad day and waste later in the day. And then it's the one who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cares, even when they mentioned it, but I think this is next to the point. <br /> <br /> Is a movie really better if you can see it through various diverts? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> Surely, the dragon can pass that hall ... and over ... and over ... and over ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst end in film history? This was straight out of Scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now, say, do you want supper? Sure, but not in a Chinese place .... with Dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HA HA HA !! HAHA HA! I was Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> Blur to black <br /> <br /> My god, it hurt me. It was so stupid. <br /> <br /> Don't be scared though the whole building explodes ... and no one is alive. For some reason there is a second untouched, unmanned lab that has survived quite well, so they can make a successor. Hurray to us all. <br /> <br />
