Slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and honestly irreversible. I'm a horror movie fan, but this movie was just as poor, words failed me. The script is badly lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the play is surprisingly bad. Just an overall stinker, that I wasted the time of my life. It has all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a movie that was really bad. <br /> <br /> Who dyed this mess? <br /> <br /> I just loved two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask - which was nice. The second was the Austrailian affinity with humorous curse. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this boring mess.
