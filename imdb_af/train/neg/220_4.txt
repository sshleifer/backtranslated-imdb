"The Crush" is a pleasant enough 40-something-friends romantic chick wing for the first two thirds or so, as it tries to be a Briton, "Sex and the City." <br /> <br /> I especially had the turn of the trophy's young hunger, whose character didn't fall out much (think about it, we didn't see so much physical flesh from him and Kenny Doughty is also worth seeing). <br /> <br /> They definitely make much more young / older women than the opposite in some or other version of Sabrina (not a movie I like) or with the Douglas / Zeta Jones or Dion / Svengali nuptials. <br /> <br /> Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex-pat is also welcome family of Brit dramas and comedies, such as the Tartan Anna chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot turns at the end, feeling very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came to an end that I realized what might be really wrong. As with "Sex and the City", the author / director is male, firstly author John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out with regard to their loved ones. and at work (the characters are a principal, a police officer and a doctor), who would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club" which would make its parallels with the gay Broken Hearts Club even more evident. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/6/2002)
