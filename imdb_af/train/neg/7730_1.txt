Despite much style, flash and brilliance, this French musical fails to speak. The songs are repetitive, predictable and boring. The story is uninteresting, just like the many characters. <br /> <br /> People break song and dance, without motivation or reason. Most of the role players wear sleeping wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio-bound. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so negative an effect it had on me. Certainly a shame, such a multifunctional role in such a <br /> <br /> show, I think, where successes (in this case, to the great classic "Umbrella") often go wrong. One cannot repeat, just recreate.
