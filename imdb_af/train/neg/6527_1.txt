Certainly, no Saturday morning TV children's show was ever done so badly. After all, the producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well, in this terrible offer they could count at least the money they saved on sets. The writing could have been a rejection of a long-forgotten space-opera series, with a few choking lines added to cooler Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such an ugly story, so the action is just boring. The spaceship props are absurd - for example, a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, but planet sets should be the worst in movie history. Most are rough drawings, and all are bathed in an often incorrect red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a strut. And it's a bad one - like rib-thin like the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and will probably agree!
