SPOILERS: I'm always amazed at how many people this game gave good reviews. It was awful. The writing and the voice acting alone destroyed it. Gabriel and Grace are the most untouchable characters in the game. You almost pray for their death. And worst of all, there are fewer vampires in this game than there are revolvers in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The lack of true vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you expect a kind of Anne Rice style vampire story, forget about it. This game's story has very little to do with vampires. You won't even see to the end, and even then you won't be able to fight them. <br /> <br /> The story has radical, and pretty much blasphemous, views of Christianity. I'm surprised it comes from the drawing board. I'm not even Christian and I found it offensive. Mostly, the story is about a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure. The kidnapping of a royal baby, which had to be the focus, is really pushed aside. There is no speed from Gabriel to find the baby. In fact, he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few blocks. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty bad. The characters move on a snail's pace, even on the best of systems. They are thick and outdated. And it is hard to go from the FMV of The Beast Within this Terrible Blood Blood Game Engine. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace also takes a terrible turn. I really don't know why it was so rushing, but they sleep together. And it's not nice. Gabriel spends most of the game, telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he doesn't think she's the one for him. And he really looked like they'd slept together. But he is so untouchable throughout the game that you hardly even care. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he constantly made sexual intercourse with anything the woman's whole game. By the end of the game, Grace left him with what seemed to be a Dear John letter. I think she was as fond of most of the players. <br /> <br /> I found the story annoying and boring. I expected to play a story of a royal baby kidnapped by vampires. And I expected to see and fight vampires, maybe Gabriel or Grace even became one. But no. Instead, the story focused on the writer's distorted vision of Christianity. What a pity. Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we have it. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were actually the end. At the end we get some action puzzle puzzles. But it wasn't worth getting the whole game to suffer. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend this game. I got it back when it came out years ago, and I hated the game engine so much I had been laying it for years. I only recently dropped it off to see what I was missing. And now I'm very sorry that I did. My favorite characters are ruined. I hope there will be a fourth game just to release the series. And I hope they get it right next time. It would be a terrible shame to end this series with this installment.
