I was very disappointed in this 1970 movie based on a Bernard Malamud story. It is basically a story of possible salvation, racial prejudice and the failure of life based on distrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling toddler and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in the angel (Belafonte), his wife, Fanny (Ida Kaminska), will recover. The problem is that Morris basically gave up on life and refuses to believe Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believes this, Fanny improves, but in the end he doubts and Fanny suffers. It would be great if there was an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny spoke to Morris. <br /> <br /> Successful Jan Kadar. Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's "The Store on Main Street" director also leads this movie. Mostly Kaminska is reduced to the film, and mostly bed cats and her friendliness in her speech do not really bear the desperate situation she is facing. She continues to support Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying Jewish religion. For most of the movies she didn't realize the Angel's appearance in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is clogged and the scene confronting the Angel's girlfriend Belafonte in their flat is unforgettable, but all too short. <br /> <br /> We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why it's dead. <br /> <br /> Those watching this movie should leave the theater in a state of depression and desperation.
