Yes, the only thing this film is memorable is that it was a young Tom Hanks who would be a relevant star in Hollywood just a few years later. However, here is not a movie that shows his talent very late and the only other thing that can be seen about this movie is the scene where he thinks he sees a monster and runs an old door. Yes, this movie is about the ills of playing a game that a group of people use to make their imagination and start with interesting scenarios. Basically, an aftercare special for the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons, played smartly like Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this movie thought that nerds would not be of any kind unless they were going out and drinking, drinking drugs, having many unprotected sex and harassing other weaker children like all the popular kids do. No, these bad people have played a game that actually needed one to use brain, heaven's no! Not, if they have a brain, they can actually think themselves and not be burned out by certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. Admittedly, this could be a movie against addiction, but there are far fewer people who died Dungeons and Dragons to their very existence than to say what drunk driving demands are like a month.
