This show is boring, crippled and basically eats all sorts of different things to make it "original". First, the animation is so ugly ... Johnny's horrible ... and everyone's annoying. The twins look like teen-female Dexters of "Dexter's Lab" and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee (also from Dexter's Lab.) Secondly: The plots ... are painfully lame and make them difficult to follow. The gags are weird, and nothing really compels me to laugh a bit ... especially when trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but that alone turned me off. <br /> <br /> Third: The whole theme song begins with the completion of Green Day's "American Idiot." And while I'm not a big fan of the band, I find it really stupid that they will take the same opening melody, and then subtly change, to make it themselves. <br /> <br /> Case in point ... it's a big fat ugly drill. 10/01
