This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who are eventually in trouble due to red dye in one of their schoolmate shampoos, and after reprimanding this act, they decide to go to Florida for a holiday. On their way there, they meet a few guys in a local dinner and decide they will meet at a different place later. The girls come on a path beside the forest and stop for a while and while one of the girls decides to walk around a little, she sees a murder where the local sheriff herself is involved. She scared and ran to tell the others what had happened. The other girls decided to go with her and two were killed by the murderer. Then the two remaining girls are captured by the killer and placed in the local prison cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff watches over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer, he both ignores them and acts as ignorant and everyone else in this movie who can only make two and two not much less is it maybe a little detective at that. The best part was the rape scene between the murderer and one of the girls where he decided to rape her in her prison cell and it seemed as if the girl really wanted to be raped and the bare bust I recognized was good, but before that . their lips meet he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon staring at it, the same motive, just sharing a different character. It's not a movie worth renting, even for an 80-year-old low-budget movie, and the end was the worst end I've ever seen in a movie. It made me return my money!
