The worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this terribly painful rotten rubble. Scorsese is completely out of his element in this movie, with the horror clicked suddenly aloud phone ringing and by crackers who look nice and embarrassing comes from such a master craftsman. The cast is completely messed up here and the southern accent is very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest attorney in history who will ever believe he can defend anyone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90-year-old movie psycho killer. The scene with De Niro and Lewis early is very uncomfortable and the climax goes on and on and we must all be more than tired of the psycho stalker who never dies. One of my most horrible movie experiences. Rent the original it is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
