This movie was extremely depressed. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is his main character, is anything but "motherly". Well, she was unhappy in her marriage and put her husband and children first. Her husband died. She then visits her son and meets this hunger that sleeps with her daughter and ends with her sleep. To this part the movie is good. Not great, but it can be looked at. The man is beautiful and who can blame her? Okay, it's not very maternal to sleep with your daughter's lover, but let's blame it for the shock to lose her husband. <br /> <br /> She gets totally obsessed with the man. I think it's the part where I start to dislike the movie. She is always there to enjoy him in an "old-fashioned" way with snacks while working on her son's house (I think this is the only thing she has ever learned to do), as if it were the only way to get her attention. Of course, the man is not very interested (actually, he seems to have considered sleeping with her) and instead of being insulted, she continues to go to bed with her when he become very abusive. "I want to please you," she says in a desperate way, insulting her very badly. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me in this movie is the total lack of self-respect the mother has for herself. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless bunch" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to women. If that were me, I would have bought myself a small object that would bring me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
