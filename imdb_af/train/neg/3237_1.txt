Not that I cut myself into the eyes of a realistic bloodshed, but if I expect a DVD in a massacre, and what I get is one bloody scene (the eyeball) at the tail end of asinine false bang , and turning into a desk chair, I think finally "Well, it's 43 minutes of my life forever." I will not see whether Flower of Meat and Blood as much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of flesh and blood has some difficult places to look at. The devil's experiment didn't. It was at its best, stupid and in the worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectation was too high. I thought the DVD: "Oh man, it's going to be sick." After watching their fake, the girl slammed about a thousand times, I watched it fast ahead. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People who search F'd up movies just to see how F'd up it really is, or 2) horror completest. I searched this and the other Guinea movies for the latter reason, but even if I fell in the former category, this movie wouldn't drive my boat. In fact, I can imagine that this film increases your blood demand ... as in "YOU ALWAYS CAN ADD THE B * T ALWAYS!" So finally, the only reason to own this movie is for collection purposes. If you want blood expectation not provided by traditional horror, get Spore from Death. Sure, it also sucks, but at least you get the blood and intestines you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see someone price this crap is because they feel they should do it. No artistic merit I can understand, no reason for his fame, nothing. Just a lame effort to be shocking.
