The start of this movie was good. It really got stupid after he told the people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I come from a small town, I would be offended after seeing this movie. They made many of these people silly and crazy. How can these people do so little to follow him all day? Many times these people tell him how to kill himself, as they urge him to do so. How can so many people have little respect for others? I also think they could have made a much better end to this movie. There were also good parts of this movie. Some people might like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
