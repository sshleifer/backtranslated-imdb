This movie has been trying too many things at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood stick, juicy romantic comedy, family values ​​promo ... the list goes on and on. It had failed at all, but there was enough interest to stop me from turning it off to the end. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit behind OVER WAR, INC, it makes me such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets for the lack of a reflect serious criticism rather than merely the poor writing, direction and production of this particular film. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism about the corporatisation of war. But that way, it's fun to reduce the real atrocity of what's happening. Remind me a few THREE kings, who are also a real concern.
