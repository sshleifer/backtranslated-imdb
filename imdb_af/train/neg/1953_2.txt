The first episode of this new show was today, and it was terrible. Not only did Shaggy have a wheezing new voice that listened to his lines torture, but it is so far from the original concept and animation style that it is barely recognizable as a 'Scooby-Doo' show. <br /> <br /> Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were away and Scooby's cousin Scrappy was there, the team still solved mysteries. Instead, this new show offers Shaggy and Scooby a James Bond-type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a home. There's not even a so-called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser for the next episode that promised a robot of a transformer type doesn't reassure me). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and do it? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points for two scenes with the entire Scooby Doo gang, all talking to the right voices except Shaggy, and even then I'm too generous.
