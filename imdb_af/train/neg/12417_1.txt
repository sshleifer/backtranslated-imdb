Any movie that starts with a cow hand moving a female calf can't promise much. As for the stereotyping of kibbutz, as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it just wasn't. OK, every kibbutz has just a tiny piece of something shown in the movie (like young people guessing the night in the kitchen), but you can't show the whole kibbutz as full of everyone - we'll say - naughty features . Every kibbutz had its own problems, but almost no kibbutz had them all. The opinions of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in the Garden of Eden called the Emek. Yes, and the acting was also good, so you see it was not all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably also deliberately.
