This 1997 film-blanc classic story of smoldering passion has earned its well-deserved legendary status as one of the screen's greatest saga of a doomed and hopeless love. The continuous, continuous and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and her name is sure that many of a viewer's heart set a flutter of memories of your own first loved one. The brilliant script disappears this embryonic relationship to sit in front of the enchanting audience, sitting as the abstract, almost expressionistic cinematography, focusing on the just-below-the-surface desires that flow between the principals. You can cut the sexual tension with a dull band of iron. <br /> <br /> A small drop of sweat at the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine, leaving no doubt about its meaning. Scenes like this are abundant and carry again and again. As with Jane Eyre and Rebecca (after which this masterpiece is so often compared), the close-ups of the actors' faces like them will experience the slow explosion of the great love that will not be forever. <br /> <br /> The classic RC soundtrack score, with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer, highlights the emotion that drips like a leaking crankshaft. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism by mentioning what I consider to be a minor mistake (and dare to dare the anger of the millions of fans who love this classic for their hearts), I would say that the feature of "Runaway Car" tension is briefly broken down by the highway scene, which now stays a little over repeated views (and probably even unnecessarily?) until the everlasting, bittersweet story of Love interrupts. considered the smallest of the flaws in this critically-acclaimed modern cinema? 'Citizen Kane' she had 'Rosebud'. . . 'Runaway Car' must also have its heading. Perhaps the movie, with a close-up of Judge Reinhold, may have opened, like something like a car is an extension of its owner! And the rest of the storyline can then be dedicated to analyzing each syllable, subtle and nuance of that phrase. If that plot line was done, this movie might have convinced "Titanic" at the Golden Globes that year. <br /> <br /> Sorry? That I didn't even read the novel.
