With an unknown role that probably remains so, this "movie" is another cheap treasure trove that amazes me how it was released. I have no problem with especially horror and slasher movie, and actually it's my favorites. But when they do this bath, it really takes the monkey and it's no wonder the genre is so difficult. The story is so clich√© and unimaginable as possible with a lot of people in a cabin, in the woods herded by this zombie / ghost man. It's not the most sucking story, it's the horrific play, the home-made directing quality and the awful soundtrack. Not to mention smiling effects and making an incredibly lazy movie - these morons are out in bright daylight, but we are meant to believe it's night? What the hell did the director think of this move? What had he had one day to make it all the movie? He was afraid of the dark? (Is hilarious to see a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting like she is black) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side for the actors is that they look like people in the local supermarket works. so they can at least escape from this movie without ever being noticed. I'm sure one of the "teenagers" bingo plays in the local bar, but she is 40-45. <br /> <br /> Anyway, good for a laugh, but just a waste of movie and time.
