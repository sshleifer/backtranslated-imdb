As much as I like Japanese movies, this one has not just cut it. A movie about rebels and the survival of a royal bloodline apparently has to be a very slow movie with a dubious plot. <<br /> Photography is good, although I have seen much better swordfire scenes in other Japanese movies, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn't convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you don't even see its presence. But worst of all was the way the plot developed. I have to admit that I sometimes had a difficult time understanding who was who and what was going on. But the platonic love between the main character and the other one was completely unnecessary and was evident from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for an action-Japanese movie, it's not. It is very slow, with very little swordfire scenes and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
