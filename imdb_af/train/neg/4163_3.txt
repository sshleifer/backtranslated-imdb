I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their story, and I thought what they wrote was useful to understand. The fact that they actually came up with excuses - rewrites, budget constraints, production forms, etc. - simply underline how bad this movie is. And my panning criticism is not personal, but merely a warning that this one does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> It's viewable, but hardly so. There are plot holes in each corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the end becomes a mile telegraph. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram that interacts with a recreation team is drowned in a stupid dialogue, such as making a meal in the middle of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy to be. Want to devour us a Hamburger Helper Sally, murdered among us by these automatic carpet firefighters? Apparently, this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tube mirrors has no access to MREs. As they enter the last rooms, they treat the place more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting zone. <br /> <br /> The rationale for meeting the scary smoke is that it cannot be killed by one hand. . But just one scene ago, the hero dropped the king to do it exactly. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands on the best activated character in the movie. But it doesn't say much.
