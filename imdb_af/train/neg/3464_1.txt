It seems that several of the people who reviewed this movie first looked at it because it was filmed close to where they live. How about a lazy endorsement? If this movie was filmed where I lived, I wouldn't call it in my review. It's terrible! Several reviews say that this movie is a ghost or a tongue-in-the-cheek horror movie, it's not. It is sad to see this film as a comedy as it not only makes a bad attempt at a horror movie, but also as a comedy. I've laughed, how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie has 2 good things for it, the mask and the weapon of choice, but unfortunately it would be more interesting to watch an hour and half of the mask and weapon lie on a table and then look at this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also laughable, young and stupid. Don't be bothered with this movie, you've already lost time to read this review, don't waste any more on this movie. Arrggghhh! It's astonishing that movies like this are even made. I expected the entire team to get a crew to be credited to Alan Smithee, namely when a person, usually a director, doesn't want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie has been sold out, I spent $ 1.19 on the rent and feel I was ripped off. Avoid. 1 out of 10
