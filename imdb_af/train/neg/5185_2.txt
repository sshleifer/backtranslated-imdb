A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a total waste of time. The writing and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is slim and the acting boundaries on hammy. This movie was clear to the Rang De Basanti crowd, but it is very short of point because it doesn't even have one of the elements that made it. RDB connects with its obedient writing, tremendous acting, good direction and a powerful social message that has never been proclaimed. <br /> <br /> Compared to the near masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero getting a leak on the villain's Persian carpet and pushing the hero's mentor dots in a truck no less! All this could have been acceptable in the 80's when there was a downturn in movie quality, and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but movie making became. It had to be. More subtle and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes, but maybe he just doesn't know how to do it! He persuaded to preach without taking care of the audience's intelligence to understand what he was trying to say. Perhaps he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the show you will think that Rang De Basanti was much better, and Santoshi had to leave Om Shanti Om's operating hurdle. -Industry bashing? That's right! Santoshi portrayed the industry as a place of rugby, tapping and portraying the decisive bank, which fortunately enjoyed the hero with a star called Sania. There are some people who would think these passages show the real face of the industry. Don't believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> All in all, increase your vote against movies like this and don't spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * from ****.
