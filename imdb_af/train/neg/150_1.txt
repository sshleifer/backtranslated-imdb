Dude, really !!!! where were you guys for the past 20 years, is it shocking in all sorts of ways, horror? It's a joke. There's nothing wrong with a low budget, but it's a laugh. If you watch the classic artists, Freaks by Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can't compare it, it gives it ' bad name, bad acting, bad script etc. Total means of money and leisure, watched many movies, like horror my whole time favorite, I'm really speechless, have nothing more to say, don't bother looking at something, please understand.
