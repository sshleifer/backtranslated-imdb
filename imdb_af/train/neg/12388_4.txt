** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can get through the extremely unpleasant topic, this movie offers a lot of helping out of exorbitant champion melodrama. Surprisingly, this movie has been copied and torn over the years, but it's hard to admit that any filmmaker is inspired by this trashy drama. Another one of the Hemingway women can act here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft is the only touch of the class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is in turn pathetic and inadvertently hilarious as smirking, smarmy bad man of the piece. <br /> <br /> The director of veteran Lamont Johnson cannot make his wallet out of this sow's head of a screenplay, filled to burst with bad bad dialogue and exorbitant situations . For example, the last series, where Margaux grabs her shotgun and pursues Sarandon after his latest shocking act, is meant to be exciting, but instead he is being warmly sought. Add a notorious, rogue and musical play by Michel Polnareff and you have a real guilty pleasure, though you probably feel lean and need a hot shower after watching it. Don't say you're not warned.
