Spooks are fun trash, with some well-targeted ranges, ridiculous sites and dialogue, and a few third values. <br /> <br /> Many have described it, a British version of 24, and one can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the poor dome, but the performance is so much slicker, sexier and I suspect, expensive. Some people describe poor comedy as 'soft comedy'. <br /> <br /> It's a gentle spy story hour, exactly the opposite of anything John Le Carre created. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley some day.
