Horror movie ?? really ???? I can't believe how bad this movie was, what's the point of this movie ??? The movie almost 1h and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of it, is just Lena who walks around on her face with this stupid look after she had an accident. Not much talk, not even much action. i have to say it, the last 20 minutes it had little small action .. and was still stupid ....... and the end o my God, i don't know where to start, it also ends with this dumb look at lena face lol .. don't get me wrong, i love Lena Headey, i think she's a great actress, but i don't know what took her in the movie. Don't waste your time and don't watch It, because this movie has no story, has no acting .. and has no sense ... not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you've watched it forever has.
