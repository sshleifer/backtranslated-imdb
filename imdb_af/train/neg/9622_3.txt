When I saw this movie being shown on TV, I looked very much forward. I grew up in the 1980s and as everyone who grew up in that era saw every 80's teenage and summer camp movie out there. So I couldn't wait to see this movie that completely spoiled the movie genre. What a disappointment !! The movie was nothing but a lot of bad jokes and gags over and over, with virtually no plot and no dust. And the filmmakers endeavor to completely fail dark humor. Some of these so-called jokes have become nothing but cruel and offensive. The only good thing about this movie was the wardrobe, music and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgic journey and see all the styles of the summer clothes from the 80's, and that also goes for the music. And the acting was all right: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were present. Badly they have no better material to work with.
