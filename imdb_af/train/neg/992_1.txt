This movie was disgusting. They should be warned that some sadistic nasty writers are trying to make a name for themselves before being held hostage for an hour and a half to look at garbage. What is rubbish? The abuse of people's time, the abuse of energy and the waste of any kind of education system that she has learned to read and write. Talia you are a sick dementia loser. Your psychiatrist should prescribe stronger medication for your problem. <br /> <br /> The acting and plot have no choice but to move forward through the center of the garbage. I ended up on a scene for which I had nothing. If you want to learn how to shock people, watch a Larry Clark movie. I have lost all respect for the entire movie of this movie "No support from me." How can actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross portrayals of human behavior manifest themselves from the mind of a psycho? I feel sorry for all the actors who participated in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the author of this movie is; Congratulations on your attention.
