Despite the praise on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war films of the era to portray the mud, boredom and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately it is all that it is in this movie. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie should have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best World War II movies, "Twelve O'Clock High," has very little action. But it compensates with creaking dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of G.I. Joe" is a short battle segment (titled "city under siege" on the DVD) that takes place in Italy. It is one of the fastest and most convincing fights of any war movie. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't worth looking at just for this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, intended to be a "romo", but comes from a perversion. By contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, if flawed, man. Like Capt. Walker (Mitchum) says when he wants to release another patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer to home." But the last step? a patrol too much ?? drives him over the mental point. Sorry, the rest of the movie doesn't matter to anything else. As far as Meredith's portrayal of Pyle is concerned, it is almost comatose.
