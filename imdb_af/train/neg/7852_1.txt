I'm not a horror movie buff, but my wife's cousins ​​and cousins ​​are. So, I saw the first movie. It was horrible and tense, but not my taste. Still good. For similar reasons, I am currently being subjected to a prosecution. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is beyond absurd. I can buy disasters in the desert. I can buy that mutant exists. I can even buy the events so strange and strange that the army may decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am willing to suspend my beliefs. <br /> <br /> But under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the army team dedicated to setting up such an area cannot fend off the mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that new recruits may not have the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers. Such recruits will be built into a skilled team. <br /> <br /> A group of armed soldiers will not be pulled out by a few mutants with knives. That's just how it works. Team movements, much better firepower, and of course, radio support, will ensure nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying you won't have victims, but once the area is hostile, military training would take precedence, no one will go to the bathroom alone. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the area was so busy with the hostility that the team couldn't handle the danger, they would kick in the radio for the backup. And believe me, their radios will not be trapped, if there is a chance that normal radios would not, the team would have a military issue satellite phone. Chances are they can search every hour. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you must assume that our soldiers are incompetent fools, incompetent leaders, and an incompetent chain of command. Although it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained, capable soldiers. Mutants with knives are far below our ability to handle. <br /> <br /> The whole movie performance depends on the impossible to think, the film fails to deliver. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors and pilots are unable to handle even the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the film insulting.
