Don't spend your money or your time on this spicy movie in the cover of filmography. When every third word is devoted to false language and there is no real plot, as well as having a role play of old actors who still have the same dated past performances and did not develop in their careers, leave a lot to say . I expected something better from the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision of other Puerto Ricos will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores. A fake word at a given moment in a movie can be used to emphasize a given point of view and can even be funny or sad, depending on the context (see, for example, the movie Elsa and Fred), but it shouldn't be the plot does not penetrate. The film is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this movie.
