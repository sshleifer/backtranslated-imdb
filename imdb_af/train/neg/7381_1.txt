Okay, first, Seagal's voice is called 50% of the movie. Why? Because the author and the story apparently wrote while shooting and they need to change its story-continuity dialogue, as they have multiple versions. From the beginning you just scratch your head because the overbubbles aren't just distracting, but they don't make sense. <br /> <br /> It says, the story still sucks and doesn't make sense at all. When I got to the end, I just scratched my head because the movie was so useless and the end didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the pest. This movie has stopped me looking at Seagal straight to video because they just get worse and worse.
