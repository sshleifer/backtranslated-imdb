The acting is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are attractive, so if you are looking for good active soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise you waste your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the unambiguous head, is often a mystery. She could only have told the truth - the truth presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he had not committed. Was she the protection of her father, who walked off half, as it was when he persistently prosecuted a malicious lawsuit? Was she busy herself, with her reputation suddenly worrying when she only looked her art? During the trial, this brave woman grows before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, who begins as a narcissistic jerk, becomes an unselfish hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Of course, since no good deed should go unpunished, we are told she never sees him again.
