I have a high level of tolerance for the stranger, but frankly, some movies are over, so far they've hurt your brain. It's such a movie. Understanding or even explaining this is impossible and I think the movie is best understood when using drugs. It is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some very cute Japanese animations that include a cat. But out of the blue there are many twisted and sometimes disturbing things - it makes me wonder if I lose something in the translation. Though this is the case, why should we be treated to images of a magic that burns a lady with a clever, defecating, gagging, burning animal, etc. It was actually random and very terrible. Strange, and I don't know why, some see it as a work of genius. I just can't get it.
