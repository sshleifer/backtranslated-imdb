I tried to keep this slasher as I try to enjoy all slasher movies. I mean manslaughter mingled with a little nudity and some tension, how can you go wrong. But Unhinged I think is an example of the formula going wrong. The main problem is the terrible act of the main three girls who have landed in the house. It was as if they were under sedation, and that has prevented me from ever being interested in them. The movie is in search of tension and creepiness, but the direction of the sap is one of them, leaving the movie tough. This is a pity, because if the movie were to be performed better, it would have been bait. The story and characters are pretty dirty and there are a few dark and bizarre humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There are some good nudity, and sometimes brittle blood loss, just not enough to give the film the kick it needs. The final is pretty distorted and terrifying, and gives the movie a big lift, but unfortunately it is too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure slasher movies. There is a good potential, but the film does not deliver enough value.
