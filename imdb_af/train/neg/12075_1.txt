This Hamlet has ever made one of the most boring MST3000 episodes. I'm not a Shakespear fan, but I don't think he ever planned his work to be so slow. It's also one of the most difficult movies to find because there are so many Hamlets. As I said, this one is very boring. It's in black and white, the pace is slow, and there is minimal scenery. The actors are also mentioned, so it doesn't help. It's the one MST 3000 I can't see in one seat, because the man Hamlet plays says his lines can make someone sleep.
