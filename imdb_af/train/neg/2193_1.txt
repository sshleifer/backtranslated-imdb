A demented scientific friend is beheaded so he brings her head back to life. Honestly, this is the plot of the movie. He tries to get her another body that he is looking for through the sleaze area of ​​the village for that perfect body. For some reason, he had a nasty monster in a closet at his cabin. The sleaze style of the movie is laughing. No one in the movie can really include the head. The cupboard sample is a man with a mask strap and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the end is done so badly. View the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe my people I won't see this movie on its own.
