There are many very nice people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Maybe it's even worth looking at. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who will make his point on the world. He is the son of a good family with a good reputation, and he is on his way to the law school. But like so many such settings, things aren't quite as perfect as they are. The expectations in this family are much greater than love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely let him leave the house. It seems to be the result of a previous traumatic event that shook the family, which is partly revealed by flashbacks, but not spelled out until the end of the game. Tristan's claustrophobic environment leaves him in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends took him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows a few strippers back to a beach house party, and from there Tristan befriended Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into a drug-trafficking underworld. <br /> <br /> While technically well-crafted, this movie is suffering from a slim writing and a storyline that isn't very pleasant. Also against this movie are some constant camera tricks that generally look annoying and out-of-place, such as slow motion, fast motion, freezing frames and echoes. These are the types of effects that a director can normally use to show a character perspective during drugs, except in this case they appear to have been randomly thrown into random points, in some inexpensive style attempts. <br /> <br /> Despite the movie of relative unknowns, appearances were all around, especially with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we will see at least some of these people in bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when I call the actors, I have to call their appearance. Review based on warmth, these movies score a 11. The women in this movie are incredibly-looking and almost divert you from what a boring movie you are watching. I'm sure the male characters are also very attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not for sale, rent, or even free viewing. Unfortunately, it's just not worth doing.
