This movie begins with the execution of a witchcraft practitioner and his mistress. His head was cut off and buried separately from his body ... sounds like "The thing that wouldn't die"? Well, it does play out a bit, but once the body is reunited, all the interesting and horrific deaths are done and the film moves very slowly. I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I thought "When will it end?" The characters in the movie are mostly idiots and they deserve a lot to die because it's really stupid. The villain is also very bad because he is moving slowly and you really wonder how he manages to do something when he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing to keep you awake after the head is trapped is the fact that there are so many breasts that are flashing that you really lose track. Yet I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core, and as a horror movie it's a way to move slowly along the path to very slow regions to be even a bit enjoyable. And don't read the back of the box, as it found out there was meat eating zombies that attacked the town. There is no ... just a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and repel it so easily. is not a factor in the movie and their scene is rather pointless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you really find it cheap.
