Yeah, well, I really regretted giving up on Saturday night to watch this strange, but very long, movie. Apparently the main character didn't have to steal two hours of my life. Here is the symbol of the antihero in "No Regrets." We got this jerk, so messed up, so erratic, so selfish, aimless and unlikely to be very difficult to get a highly-favored businessman's emerging son, Jaemin, unless it was just that: physical attraction. He claims otherwise that it is love. But after watching it, it's like loving Charles Manson because you're digging the beard. (Alright, he's not that bad, but still no real redeeming features.) I could never get past the reason Jaemin endless stems Sumin. It was never shown, just said that Jaemin van Sumin loves. Maybe it's a culture thing that has flown over my head: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It must be because a little over half of the movie is one that bumps the other and the last part bumps back and forth to the point I thought it was a screw ball comedy. I waited for a tiger called "baby" to make an appearance. Good, so Sumin works two jobs while going to school, so far so good at someone trying to improve themselves. But after his first taste of his stalker's appeal, he gives his day work for a kind of prostitution ring. What? Well, as mentioned earlier, the obsession with work / career change stops and if you throw a lot of other very angry characters, you get one ruined movie where incredible events just happen without buildup. Basic movie, not 100% horrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
