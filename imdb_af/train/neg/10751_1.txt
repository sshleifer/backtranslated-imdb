Why did I squander my money on Sundance's last day? I want a refund ... Can I have $ 16 back? While watching this movie, I waited for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be was to read the plot, which wasn't really like the movie. Why did the director fit in with their handy camera and then zoom out? It wasn't very artistic. Why did the director for Lulu drop her nails for fifteen minutes? Why was it when the actors tried to talk, they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt that Phantom Love had nothing at all, and to be honest, I felt that my friends had holiday videos a much higher level of entertainment than this movie.
