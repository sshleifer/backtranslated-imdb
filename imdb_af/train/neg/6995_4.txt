Funny how many of those who say it is much better than Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a 2-hour MTV video featuring a movie, action pay, gory and "Whoopee". Strange editing, pop video camera work, cool music blah blah blah. Actually, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes. (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster) ... Pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in "who will die next" and a total cash on the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate a lot of income alone fans of the original who are going to see it out of curiosity ... <br /> Don't get classic remake on your nerves? Can't they really get something original? Why revive Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think so boring, are supposed to slowly show you how to get everything you ever wanted you to be). It's an action movie, simple and simple. The faster the better. If you're in action lenses (and like this, the 2004 version is well done) just enough, but for anyone who likes a little dust on their movies, get ready to sigh again. <br /> <br /> Watch the theater over the next few years, as we get the Godfather series made by the latest Pop director and Star Wars again. All the kids said how the new version miles are better, as the old version is slow and sowing and shoots a camera for over 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but over 10 year they will still discuss the Romero version, not this pap
