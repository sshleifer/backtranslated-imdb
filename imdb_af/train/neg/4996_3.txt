I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, it got stuck or should I say, "just stupid." It's just another example of outdated humor. It might have been funny in 1940, but not now. Not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially loved him as he began to change his boy's body and the loud voice of the Busby Berkeley musical where he grew up and sounds. <br /> <br /> He was good like Jimmy MacDonald, but the rest Of the players only played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing, but screaming all the time. He was brutal to hear and was a major drawback to the movie.
