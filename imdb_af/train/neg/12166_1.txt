Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes she is related to Bruce), the killer of the first movie, is back on her old tricks. She is one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at the camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing are good. But a few steps across the line and Angela kill them. Bad jokes totally at stake. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a nasty and nasty squatter, but has good points. It is also harsh and nasty but has no good points. The plot was killed and it does NOT add new to the formula. There are many gory murders in it (people are burned alive, heads are cut off, throat cut), but all the gore is so fake it is actually comic. It also has the smallest number of campers I have ever seen and virtually everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is the free female nudity (provided here by the incredibly undisputed Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the only exception to Springsteen and Higgins, the play is uncomfortable - even by shooting film standards. There is also a brutal rand for this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Drilling and sick with a stupid plot, useless nudity and bad gore. Skip it.
