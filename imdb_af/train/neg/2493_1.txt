A really horrible movie. At first I didn't know it was a Kiwi effort - but soon I realized that all the characters are talking to scarce disguised kiwi accents among the fake Americans. Why does it need America anyway? - it could have been in NZ and then the actors could use their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team can hear the terrible efforts to speak with American accents? A bad bad movie. I'm surprised it took so long - how did it get out of the tin? It just looked like a very poor effort for a Segal / Willis-type action man. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there was any taxpayer money in this scrap of waste, I would revolutionize all the money in the Treasury. I'm still arranging (get it? Word, arranging!) At the absolute rubbish I just saw. Why did I continue to watch? Well, I'm a movie fanatic and can't help!
