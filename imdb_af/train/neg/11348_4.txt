Coming soon, six GI's are being fired, being drunk and sneaking into a cult meeting in Asia. Surrounded by captains, two male dancers make a fight. Behind them, on an altar, opens a woven basket and a painted figure appears and begins to imitate a snake and ends one of the dancers on the neck. The mimic snake is dressed in a few scaled body garments. (This is definitely a female counterfeit snake.) The cult member who sneaked into the secret meeting repeatedly warned the six men that the ceremonies should not be interrupted and certainly no photos should be taken, otherwise they would be hunted. off and killed. Of course, the CIs take a flash photo, send the cult members into an evil hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and run it in the Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the guys, the most offensive and snarky, dies of a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake entered his hospital room. Back in New York it all looks pretty old news as the dismissal Men establish their civilian lives, and maintain their bond with each other. Their work ranges from manager of a building line (David Janssen) to studying the research student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a pretty blonde girl friend. Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. But they all come together well enough, and everyone looks happy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark, cunning, mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) appears and Marshall Thompson likes her and hints at her in the group. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens. Eerste Janssen is shocked by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue. Something scared him so much, he fell through the window and died in the fall to the pavement. Long and Dobson suspected what the viewer already knew - that Domergue had something to do with death. They also reckon she might change into a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronts her with his suspicion and she proves his point. <br /> <br /> By now, Long and Thompson are upset, especially Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is also attracted. , although he has to explain to her what "love" is. Does not matter. A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Long's girl friend - none of the six original offenders - and Thompson has to throw the snake out of the window. On the pavement below, the body changes like that of Domergue. The end. <br /> <br /> I think I will skip most of the questions the plot has. I'll just mention one of the more prosaic in passing. Who paid Domergue's price from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who pays her bills in the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? How is she going to speak American so well? What is hell going on? The authors and directors have seen some of Val Lewton's modest horror movies, and although there was not much effort in this production, they stole Lewton's unmarried gimmicks. For example, in Lewton's "The Cat People", the woman is transformed into a black leopard, but with a slight exception, the threat is always kept in the shade and is more creepy. Most of the transformations here also use shadows, but unlike Lewton's, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, Lewton used what he called "buses". Lewton's first "bus" was a literal one. A potential victim gets through the dark tunnels of Central Park alone with the sound of footprints. Something or someone follows her. She froze with fear under a street lamp. Something touches the branches of the shrubs above her. She looked up. There is a loud, whistling scream that is pointing to your hair. It's a bus that uses its air brakes to stop her. The producers used at least two "buses" in this movie and that is nothing. For example, a man is distracted by a crossing, and there is the sudden rumbling of a truck that almost hits him. There is no set-up for the shot. It's trapped with a horn. <br /> <br /> I don't care much about movies that endure the stereotype of snakes as clever, ugly, poisonous and phony. In fact, no snakes are slim, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful. Furthermore, they are more feminine than masculine in their sensory movements and snake-like approach to goals. You want a reptile symbol for masculinity? Try a six-lined racing runner. It is a very fast lizard. When it sees something to eat, pick it up and grind it down. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to see some fine, low budget scary movies, don't bother it. Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other minor masterpieces, of which it's a clear copy.
