I went to see this one with great expectation. Unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid and overall the film is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic after character's behavior. Today's kids need creative stories that would inspire them, which would make them 'daydreaming' about the events. That's exactly what movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children thought they were becoming Jedi knights and exploding their own lights?) Save your time and not apply to this one.
