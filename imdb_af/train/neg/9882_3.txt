There are exactly two good things to say about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> A) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she even runs Catherine Zeta-Jones for her money, and it is indeed a high compliment. Her nakedness is short and discreet, but she only looks at her face. <br /> <br /> b) The Greek island environment, with its sun and crystal clear blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other then there is no story, the dialogue is uncomfortable and sometimes unintentionally funny ("He touched you where you are a woman!"), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy jerk . Above shows the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue, it is unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she called the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a big irritation) . Oh, and although the film is on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from children to old people, speaking English all the time. (*)
