This movie is a great example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes. Except for the names of the characters, the film has very little resemblance to the book. A book full of strong Latino characters and they usually represent non-Latinos. There is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And removing a full generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende wrote a powerful book and the book is to be read!
