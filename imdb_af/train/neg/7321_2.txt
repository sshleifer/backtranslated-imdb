Maybe my genre is, but the plot is not as terrible as Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas was also uncomfortable to deceive here (while it was on marijuana? Why should it be included? This weakened plot is significant). Farentino's character too. would have been better if she had more respect for a relationship. Will the movie try to say? not much.
