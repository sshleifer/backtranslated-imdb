In short, this movie is totally worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a movie from the perspective of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our unbelief, so the idea flops. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the whole movie is done with actors in front of green screens and we're supposed to be impressed. But as a graphic person, the overcrowding was a clear crunch to hide the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening. The color is mainly flushed to no relevant effect except to reduce the visual quality. And I don't understand why anyone would consider breaking something in this movie anyway. As something, the ridiculous retrographics have lowered the bad graphics bar - they don't even measure up to the old Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple, simple and very indescribable. There were a lot of strange prehistoric animals on the island, but it is by no means explained. <br /> <br /> The story is terribly out of faith. In fact, I can't believe I just walked out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated, and throughout the film it's based on mistrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We were in no way convinced that Joe was heroic - I mean he was flying a plane and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why should we care that Joe wants to save him? Who was the Nepalease who locked Joe and Polly in the safe, and why would they do it (remember the entire Totenkopf operation was robot)? Plotgate: (1) Why did Bai Ling's character (a huge fall of her excellent character in "The Crow") stop the robots that Joe had captured? They were looking for the bottles and didn't find them. (2) Why would Dex be captured in hell but not murdered (he did not know or know the vials, and the bad parents did not know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly points out that "they" know nothing of Totenkopf, but she has a secret source about him containing a fairly complete FBI file on him. (4) The empty space on the map as described by the Nepalese - if they know everything about this mysterious area, why is the map empty in that place? (5) Polly and Joe should give up their clothes at one stage (they are burned). Joe is given new clothes that are identical to his old clothes, but Polly is forced to wear a very strange, attractive dress. In the same line of continuity, Polly suddenly returned her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * Suck *. How far should I switch my brain to see this shit? <br /> <br /> We are supposed to be excited about the over-produced music, even if nothing happens on the screen that is nothing interesting or exciting. <Br /> <br /> And the acting? We're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents? What character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she didn't have a single line). The dialogue was not camp and did not even rise to the level of cheese. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not heroic or compelling; they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the accident of meeting them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie gets an above average rating here IMDb. IMHO must compete in the bottom 100 of all time with "Batman Forever".
