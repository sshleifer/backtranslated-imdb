What an empty and lack of gloss distribution of the classic novel. I wish people would stop talking to classical artists when they clearly have no idea of ​​the actual intent or point of the original. This version is no different. I felt the Ralph Fiennes version was much worse, though the decisive Juliette brioche as Kathy had to be the worst decision decision. FIRST ... anyway back to this version. It aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary environment and musical style. It succeeds in both but high art it is. Throw away for a rainy day maybe ... The direction was average and the editing was uncomfortable. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma does a good job as Hindley and is actually one of Britains wasted talents. The part of Heath was played with great charm and faith and I think the casting is the strongest point of this project. Although a more talented director could make better use of the facilities he had. Obviously he was a director to hire and did not stimulate the project with the passion it deserved.
