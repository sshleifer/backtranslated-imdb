This ridiculous movie sets the standard of the hippie mentality of the 1970s in a nutshell and drills us in the process. It is an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with age-sex and expectant sexes. A naive, young hippie played by the wavy (Kay Lenz) gate raises and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and one day she meets the ludicrous (Holden), who is already old-fashioned, drunk as an actor. , and she decides that she is in love with him. If you think it's superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She still tells how much she loves him and she just met him, it carries thin and really fast. I can't help but laugh throughout the film. Of course, she only uses him as a meal card, but the director is immature enough to think we're going to buy some love. A weird scene is where the two are naked and have sex, I had to make it forward because it almost inspired me to vomit. A filmy presentation of music from the 70's is also distributed by the film. Avoid it if you can. Grade D.
