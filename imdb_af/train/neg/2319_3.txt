Very dull plot holes in the movie. First we see him look at his kung-fu master's practice, and die in the middle of his exercise. It's good with me. And then at the end of the movie we see the kung-fu he just learned by watching his master while he was still a child. Is it even possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show is purely for Jay Chou fans, and the film has a depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles and plot deployment. <br /> <br /> Anyone notice that the captain of the basket team (his name forgot) and the rejected player Li Xiao look so similar to each other, to the extent that you think they were one and the same person ? Long hair, sunshine boy, tall and strong. The two seemed to have emerged from a mass-production factory designed to eradicate products that make teenage girls shout into orgasm. Not that the two actors had any value to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were lame and not funny. <br /> <br /> The scene of the 4 masters of Jay Chou comes back to help him in the basketball court, degenerating into a senseless plot as they began to base their opponents ala Royal Rumble style. Worse of all, when the 4 masters won the battle, the crowd began to cheer and the game continued. It was really a WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the game, everyone thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he gained these kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows that he is gaining the skills just by considering his master. <br /> <br /> And then his lost father comes out of the woodwork to recognize Jay. Chou as his lost son was just a little too quick from the director to turn the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a Jay Chou movie (instead of the usual "chick flick"). . Don't look if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose taste in movies is very similar to that in the list of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time, then this movie is not for you.
