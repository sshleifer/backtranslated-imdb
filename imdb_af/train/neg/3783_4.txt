It was not the most sensible animation movie experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired so much, as it tries to be good. The combination of Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later called Spirit (Matt Damon, who tells the first person) and she travels through the boundaries of the Old West. Basically he was released among all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he was kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse. He manages all those who try to drive him. But when he escapes his loft, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, and of course he has something for Little Creek's female horse. In the end, after a few more escaping, being rushed by Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap over a ravine, Little Creek leaves the Spirit, and he also sets his wife horse free, and they run home to their countryside and co-horses. Also with Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected the horses to talk in this movie, but it seems to be more than a Dumbo thing throughout, and the songs by Bryan Adams aren't the best, but it's not a horrible movie. This is nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it is nominated the Golden Globe for the best song for Bryan Adams's "Here I am". Okay!
