What a stinkeroo it seems to be !!! At one time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no big shake as an actress, but very nice and pleasant (especially in movies like The Mark of Zorro and Blood and Sand) I have this seen monstrosity, the memories of her golden days quickly disappeared. The story is incredible and fiery, the acting two-day, the supportive role that is unbearable. I can't think of an immature performance by anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have chosen. In addition, the terrible photography (and I'm not just referring to the color!) Was all shaken when it was shown.
