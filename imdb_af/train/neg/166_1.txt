Well first, I didn't sit down to see the premier of a Star Trek series watching a cowboy flying in space. That's how a normal Enterprise episode works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a mist or something that looks and wants to look at, but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 He sends a shuttle in the mist and and the shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes I saw, all the problems happen because Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh, and did you see the preview of one episode watching Archer and T'pol kiss?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode, but after that I completely spent on Enterprise and went straight to TV. Come on !!!! This is a star draw !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> What was with the banana snail too? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana shooter, but had to remain there for some stupid reason. Good, stupid to bring your pet into space, but whatever. Well, that was what I thought until they left it on a desert board !!!!! A BANANA SLUG can't leave in a desert !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these writers <br /> <br /> Any way, just to say if Enterprise is on, DO NOT !!!!!
