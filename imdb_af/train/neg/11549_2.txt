Although there were some entertaining moments, I thought the movie was pretty lame. The longer it ran, the worse it got. After entering the action in Monument Valley, I saw myself the wonderful outcroppings as the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters. <br /> <br /> The character of the girl was especially incoherent. First, she's on the deal, then she discovers the truth and his bail. Then she's back again, then they ruin again. Then she's back again. There is no clear motivation for any of her decisions. There were interesting characters, interesting screens, and many missed possibilities. I should say the pictures were much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently, the people who loved Repo Man tended to keep this one. Searchers 2.0 is not a match for The Searchers.
