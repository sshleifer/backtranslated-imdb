First, anyone who sees this successor of William Friedkin's "The French Connection" is superior, is definitely totally insane or moronous or both. The problem with reviewing this movie is it, a.) It is a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes it objectively difficult to watch, and b.) It is by John Frankenhimer, one of the best US directors ever, directed, so i wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film on drug traffic in the destruction of the city in New York. Because of his documentary approach to action and story, Frankenhimer, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful directors ever, ie "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds", and with his "French Connection 2", it feels like someone is eager and does not have the true understanding to pull it off. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to lead the successor of Gene Hackman himself tells much about Hackman's understanding of the original film. It is well known that Hackman Friedkin hated the set and promised never to work with him again. It is also known that he plans the character to be more one-dimensional, lose weight and try to play him straight. It shows you Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who would make the movie and the story. Doyle's plot to become an addict is interesting, but does not guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
