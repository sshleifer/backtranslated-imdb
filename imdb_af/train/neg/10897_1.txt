It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life !! It was stupid, there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous !! And I've never seen such a bad play in my life! The only good part of the movie was all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people think when they made this movie !! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you came to this point in the movie where the guys all got to bed. I mean it was like a kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would recommend someone who heard about this movie and was interested in seeing it just forget about it and get another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole movie was, according to me, a total waste of time.
