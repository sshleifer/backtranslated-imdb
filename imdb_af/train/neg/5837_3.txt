I can't say I loved this movie very much. It has some entertaining moments, but it doesn't seem like a comedy or a drama. It doesn't really work either. light in tone to be a drama, and the amusing moments are few and far between. It doesn't make much sense either. It does not seem to happen for any reason. And this is also extremely complicated. I feel they have just made things when they go. If they just took a little time to explain things, it might be a better movie. I would say the end was anti-climate, but that would mean that the rest of the movie was actually built up. to something that didn't. It's just like that. I didn't find it boring, but as I said, there was no point. I'll give Winter Kills a reluctance. and poor 3/10
