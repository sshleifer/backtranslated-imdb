High heels are tricky things. They can elevate women (or cross-embracing men) to new found heights, add a sharp style of style and a touch of brittle elegance. Alternatively, they can be a dangerous footache that necessarily leads to travel, fall and eventual tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointing journey than an attractive high riser. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is definitely stylish, but in terms of plot it is a tongue-bound and boring affair full of confusing, complex characters that never make full sense or sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos is just not interesting. The best bit comes at the beginning in a wonderful macabre case of childhood orchestration. From this brilliant little black comedy, things look up, but then the film comes to an end. <br /> <br /> There are solid enough performances and there is an attractive, artistic direction you'd expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise, Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish theater. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, broken mother-daughter relationship and a character alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police information officer, it could have been a melodramatic power station. Instead, it is poor. High heels stumble for sure.
