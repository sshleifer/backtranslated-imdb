I don't know what they think. I mean anyone who is even connected to this disaster. I saw such bad movies, I saw so many bad movies and then it is. But I will say one thing. Whoever wrote the script can put much on the screen that might be the most appropriate dialogue about. There is nothing good about this movie, either from a technical point of view or from any other point of view. Who allowed it to be released and then released immediately. There are some fairly well-known names in this movie. I hesitate to use the word movie.it. It's more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and makes less than 0 sense. , I can't see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this. I really got it cheap and I still tore it. If I got this movie for free, I would still be ripped off. This is an absolute 0/10
