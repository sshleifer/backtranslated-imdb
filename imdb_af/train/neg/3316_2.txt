It was the first Ewan McGregor movie I've ever seen from Star Wars. Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan, but I still can't bring myself to forgive this movie's existence. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a great Jane Austen fan and so I have been subject to several of the classics, Emma is one of them. I always considered them annoying, stupid and boring. But after seeing this terrible version, I had to admit that the original Emma was lovely and charming. Ewan McGregor hardly serves a purpose in this movie after hacking and mutilating Frank Churchill's part. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is imperceptible and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone remotely interested in English drama is to look at the original. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor, believe me, by hitting the movie, you've missed nothing but five minutes of him in a stupid hat and a bad haircut.
