This is undoubtedly Rajnikanth's worst movie ever. The first part is held with a solid comedy from Goundamani, but is getting worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also takes a dig at the Saints of the same name (Baba) through a crowny and totally lame one-liner. In the first half, Rajni took out his regular range of onliners and style and in the second half he became a quasi-saint after a beggar took him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas where Babaji (not the well-known Saints he earlier do not give him special powers for no apparent reason (except karma). It really gets interesting, isn't it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about him and wasting his magic beans and powers and fighting politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh, and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just had a Param Vir ... there .... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the ordinary politicians villains are split, overworked, and ultimately insignificant for the plot itself. <br /> <br /> But despite all the mistakes, it was nice to kill time with and scream Baby related one-liners during public events. It is also nice to see others curse about this movie. AR Rehman said he had composed the songs for his movie through the phone. That's how important he considered it. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop watching Rajni movies after they see it. This film was probably promotional material for Rajni who entered politics, but the results of the movie itself would have killed any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun if you switch off your brain though.
