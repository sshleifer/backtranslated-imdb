This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. The acting was bad. The area was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that once appeared in centuries is one night. Most of the world's people have decided to look at this comet. Then, the next morning, all but a few of the comet's people were radiated. People's clothes are still intact, plants are still alive, but people have turned to dust. No legs, nothing. It's ridiculous. How can radiation burn people, but they leave clothes and other biological substances? <br /> <br /> Better still, the comet has some people moderately into zombie meat that eats monsters. Their makeup would not even look scary to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and they're supposed to look stupid. <br /> <br /> There were the survivors. People surrounded by the steel when the comet passed, were spared from zombie stupid and dead. How can steel block a comet's radiation that burns people in their tracks? <br /> <br /> Just as abusive is the 60's horror music played in the background by parts of the movie, or the 80's hair that doesn't serve the movie and opens your television. <br /> <br /> However, the stupid part of the movie is the characters it focuses on: Two Valley Girls and Chakotay by Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who will plunder the day after an apocalypse with meat running mutants? There were four 5 minute horror scenes throughout the movie, and most of them were dreams. Meanwhile, these scenes are unsophisticated dialogue that makes South Park look intelligent. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don't see this movie ever.
