There is an excellent reason why Edison went straight to the video: it would end up in the theaters with a crumbling death. The film is far too long and was dangerously boring. Just a notch above lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, which of course had an extra two weeks before their next movies), the bad guys are so lazy and acting almost non-existent as Justin Timberlake's play. I hate to beat the man, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad ... just mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J is given what seems to be a shot as chief. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is also almost always enjoyable (you can see him several times, as he chews the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to raise this movie to three stars (out of ten ... he's not that good). /> <br /> When all is said and done, the ultimate mistake with this movie is that it is an everyday and tiring piece of pseudo-action puppet who fails to keep anyone awake. It also fails to allow anyone to give a good car over any of the characters. All in all, it's just boring. It is said, rent it if you suffer from insomnia.
