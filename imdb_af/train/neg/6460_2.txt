* Can anyone tell me WHERE is the comedy ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very poor comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (with him!), and the whole thing is so thick! <br /> <br /> * They were trying to make a live cartoon that was extremely bloody comic nightmare and it wasn't even funny? Like the plan's scene in the bathroom; It was so good with his cinematic imagination, but there is nothing left. except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ?? <br /> <br /> * It's actually a kind of job they just made to make it and earn money from it, but it has become such a crime when this money would be robbed of us all by such a low artwork was deceived, and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment! <br /> <br /> * It would have been ugly if it was big production and Brando in its golden years with a real star. <br /> <br /> * The Sheen's family here. Just be aware of this! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or "God Forbid" lovingly! Then you should go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt someone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the movie is not! And he wasn't going to be here after reading it for sure !! But the biggest problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing, or tried to be a little or even good !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The movie's torture is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) hits her shoes (Mira Sorvino)! It was so realistic !? Maybe he saw himself in her, so he punished himself for being in such a crap! <br /> <br /> * For the billion time: this one could have been better (or less worse!). The script, right up to the train's lift, was nice and I thought they'd escape to chase like another (Smokey and the Bandit), but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, any of that chimeras was very compassionate as I watched! <br /> <br /> * Why didn't this masterpiece receive any Razzie award! You want me to believe that there was lower film than HERE? I do not think so ! This is a situation where the Razzie's supervisor has to win himself for his negligence! <br /> <br /> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ! and why is it?! Well! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate comedy movies, it wasn't as good as his ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, NO. It's an abomination! And I just hate horror movies, especially those that have been propagated as comic kids! <br /> <br /> * Name good thing about it? Hmmm! Well, this one compared to another Marlon Brando's monster movie (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what is or what is bad, the ugly and the very ugly in this movie. Just pray your last prayers and go and see. May God Help You!
