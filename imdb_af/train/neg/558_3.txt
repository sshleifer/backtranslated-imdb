It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone gave dedicated viewers a cross that turned many people's minds. And now God knows why, she's back in the game. "Basic Instinct 2" is the successor to the smash hit erotica "Basic Instinct" with a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fan of the original can't even get close to this one, as "Instinct 2" is painful movies, as mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones kills the legacy of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie starts when a car blast breaks down. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, who looks sexy) is a suspicious and apparently involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a terrible David Morrisey) is being appointed to investigate her, but eventually falls for an intimate seduction. <br /> <br /> There is, without any further explanation, the basic power of this "Instinct." Nothing much is explained and we need to put through a thin, C-class erotic movie. her first role where she is turning away most of the time, part of it because of the amateurish writing, the careless direction and the terrifying low chemistry, the film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a pet scene was cut off so that it would not be NC-17) as the first entry in the series. "Instinct" is a compelling torture. <br /> <br /> a guilty pleasure, not found anywhere in the film, the acting here is really bad, Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here she gets extremely unpleasant, David Morrisey stars in the worst role of his life, and never seems make more than two expressions in the movie, confused and awakened. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue with another original series, which has managed to put in thriller with eroticism. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you ... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and it is not. Some movies should never come out of paper, and that is the feeling you get after watching it. Now it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg fell out and why Sharon Stone was expecting a big salary watch for it ......----- 3/10
