No, I'm not joking. If they ever suggest a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their movies are exactly the same in each one, and they consist only of traveling to strange places, with a problem that they easily solve, hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie they have with another plot, contact me and tell me his name. These "movies" are bad excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is a reason that the movies never go to the theaters. I'm sure when they were very young and some O.K. movies, a studio boss has been buying their rights for 15 years, or something, so now that they are, how, 17, they can make movies in other countries when they want to use the studio's money. Let me advise you, Stay away from Mary-Kate and Ashley! It's for your own good!
