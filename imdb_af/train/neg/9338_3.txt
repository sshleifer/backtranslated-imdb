Pam Grier starred as Coffy. She is a nurse who seeks revenge, on the drug dealers who have her sister been addicted to bad heroines. Like any 70s Blaxploitation movie, you can expect the racist bad guys just get their desserts. <br /> <br /> There were scores of these films made during the 70's, and it was really for both black and white audiences. This is mainly due to the evil racial passion in these films, and the humiliating, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common threads between Coffy and other films of his kind include brutal violence, corrupt policemen, car hunters, a generous abundance of nudity and sexually beautiful women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug dealers, pimps, mobsters and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was the undisputed queen of the 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was beautiful, it was both tough-like-nails, and deadly-beautiful. As in her other films, Pam fades the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that these kind of movies are unwavering, without her being the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you're better off seeing her other movies, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films are far less empty than Coffy's doing. Pam's character in Coffy humiliates herself too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films, don't be so low to get revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> If you can't see any of Pam Grier's other movies, just look at Coffy. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Just Pam's talent as an actress, make a viewing of Coffy.
