Firstly, this movie reminded me of the old movies I had to watch in the religious class at school. It's not a good thing. Actually, it's just a prank and pretentious piece of filth, just like the horrible "Left Behind" series. I'm not offended by religious films ... but I'm insulted when these religious movies are just awful. I just want to be able to say nice things about a Christian movie, but it doesn't seem to happen soon. I don't bet you gave the bible stoppers a decent budget, but they won't come up well yet. Just avoid this one. Also, the fact that the American Family Association (basically Reverend Wildmon's lack) on this movie radiates on their website is also a reason to let me hate. In fact, after watching it, I went home and watched my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 rated "Crash". Forgive my father, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
