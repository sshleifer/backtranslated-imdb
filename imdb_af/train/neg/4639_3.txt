Eyes of the Weather Wolf (1999) is a very bad movie. The starting point was really good, but the overall performance was just awful. I asked the filmmakers to take their time with this project instead of getting it into production. Some blind dude gets new eyes, bad thing is that they belong to an average old werewolf. Nasty things start happening to the man, as he comes to a cheesy creature. Can he find a cure before finding out his hot friend? Who is that strange little trunk that helps him and what's with the female policeman? If you really want to find out, see Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> Not a bad idea for a movie. I just wished the filmmakers had to spend a lot of time in pre-production before deciding to shoot the movie.
