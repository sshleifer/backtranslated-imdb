This movie has a lot of big adult stars, but fails to interest you in a way that an adult movie needs. Amongst all the stars, you couldn't get your kicks from any of the screens. The movie is shot in a dream like middle-aged couple that is embarrassing. The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves. The sex scene is as exciting as talking to your neighbor about their child in college. The dialogue is the worst I have seen in a movie. The plot was also worse with ten folds. I like the amateur route. The audio commentary was useless as it was a good flip, but even then it was bad. Unless you're a tough Jenna Jameson fan there is little here. 10/04
