Dear friends and family, <br /> <br /> I think one teenager wants to be Bibles with another teenager, then it's their eternal damnation - just remember children, "birth control" doesn't mean "oral sex", I don't care what the first student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's help calls himself a "bit of a romantic man," he is just hitting a high school girl. If she were my sister, I would eat these guys kneepads. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, I found out that Mongolians didn't kiss the same kiss, and the baseball players called Zoo like delicate lingerie. <br /> <br /> I think I'll see Richie Rich almost once more than the greed of this slip, slap, slap. Thank you and good night.
