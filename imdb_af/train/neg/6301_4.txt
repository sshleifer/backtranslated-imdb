Despite the beautiful work of the supporting actors, and an intelligent script by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal error - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as a "little thing" and unfortunately it makes him perfect. There is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and top-class publisher / friend will spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly irritating. The part has called for an actor who can make you love him, even when he's talking - for example, an Ewan McGregor. <br /> <br /> All the witty satire on the classroom etc. this annoying and thoroughly unsuitable performance. All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to come over himself.
