What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be associated with such a thing. If you are going to make a movie that involves baseball, and show scenes of baseball, the action is at least slightly realistic. Why is the crowd always standing for no particular reason during games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie .... what was it? We somehow led to believe that DeNiro found his way on the field in a referee's uniform, and that the game was even played in an urgent spill .... one of the worst plays in " sports movies. 3 stars out of 10.
