Four Eyed Samples follow the relationship of a shy, retracted videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist, who, both in the Big Apple, developed an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site. This in itself is not so unusual, but what is, is their communication method. The text is based on the creator's own relationship (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice) who, apart from writing and directing, acts as a play. also the main characters. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and docudrama, the film spreads itself with an undefined structure that is neatly situated between narcissism and self-forgiveness. <br /> <br /> As the film carries on, a short separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication becomes obsolete because the couple faces the hardship of reality. Focus only on inner conflict, or the misery of relationship, the movie struggles with a stagnant story that is not original or offensive. It could easily be bypassed by the addition of subplot and external conflict and a third act that no one exists - just a melodrama mounting that doesn't lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> What's even more aggravating is the movie's descent from story to reality that suddenly ends with an open and unsatisfactory finish. It would have been all good and foolish, but no doubt was asked and no meaning to discover or invent. <br /> <br /> (On a synot, the movie features beautiful animation and a vibrant and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch to the movie and decide for yourself.
