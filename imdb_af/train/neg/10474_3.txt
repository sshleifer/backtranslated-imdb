The Omega Code was a model of cinematographic contradiction. There was a little (but precious little) good deed, mainly by the two prophets and Rostenberg, who first appeared and had no lines. Otherwise, the play was definitely bad. The plot line was rather poor, and only partially based on already dubious Biblical interpretation. Certainly not one of the year's best.
