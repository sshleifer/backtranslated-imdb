I acknowledge that my review, from the point of view of 2006, almost 30 years after making this movie and at the time of his conception, may have been a brilliant horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> Beginning on Halloween night 1968, 6 year old Michael connects the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a spiritual institution and escapes 15 years later and returns to his hometown to murder again. <br /> <br /> From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. . The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it will end, while the music for every scene that Michael (the killer) contains is exactly the same in the movie. Thus, the viewer is warned of the likely events that follow. <br /> <br /> For the horror / thriller enthusiast, there is a serious lack of blood / gore compared to contemporary movies, although I am not related to the amount shown in this day and age. A happier medium could be found. <br /> <br /> Half an hour in the movie, not one scene is unexpected. The play for a horror / thriller movie is quite typical of the era and therefore has a punch for today's enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> A positive for the film is its dipping camera shots and dark lighting that makes the atmosphere terrifying. A second positive will be the character of Michael's doctor, giving clues to the likelihood of where the story might lead. <br /> <br /> It is clear, however, that the star in Jamie-Lee Curtis in It is hard for me to judge this movie as it was in his day, but from other horror / thriller films of the 80's indeed And to a lesser extent the 90's, it falls far from a real big horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go ahead and find a classic from the 80's. Cheers!
