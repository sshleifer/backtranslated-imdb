Like the most violent movie ever, guaranteed to break everyone - guess what? It worked, I was offended that we had exhausted money to rent it. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if everything about the movie we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I usually avoid the mad, but sucked in this one. We've since hit the trap that predicted we were renting it, and its movie privileges were revoked. There is nothing funny about this movie. Even the "adventures of dickman" scene was at its best sophomoric. Color me p *** ed. Think maybe the production value was crazy for some important reasons. No, I just sucked. Never keep it! for whatever reason. Not even with large amounts of illegal material will this movie be funny. It says a lot. Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you enjoy your common sense - never see this movie. It's a lot of things, stupid, useless and worthless to name a few. But the main thing it was, was: very funny - it failed. Crash and fire ....
