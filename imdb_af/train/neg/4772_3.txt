Before I watched this movie, I could already tell that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the hut-like place they were in and the black guy someone wanted to break his hand from the men to come). MJH's name on a movie will usually turn me off (you can say GROSS!), But I wanted to try it again. <br /> <br /> From the start I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely horrible and I almost laughed myself at every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played Sulley). MJH was even worst, but I continued to watch. <br /> <br /> However, the end was the biggest joke of them all! I was seriously shocked and thought, "It was the end? Is this a comedy?!". <br /> <br /> I thought this pile of crazy was more funny than the "Scary Movie" spokes and it's really something!
