Comedy Central has a habit of occasionally offering great programs - Chappelle's Show, The Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then there are some who love or hate some Stella, dr. Katz. Then there are some shows that have their defenders, but it's just terribly-Mencia, and now, Sarah Silverman. <br /> <br /> This show is based on the fact that Silverman is self-centered, which can be funny (Colbert Report), but can be terrible (Mind of Mencia). It shouldn't shock anyone I believe the latter is. This show is a parody of a sitcom and society, a program that is so absurd, losing itself in its absurdity and simply not funny. A woman who is doing is often done in comedy because it is not something that is common. We don't need 25 minutes. When a criminal is disarmed by a rope, it just loses its appeal - we saw it back in Jay and Silent Bob Strike, except the women were warmer and the whole scene was more absurd and made it better. But the best comparison of this show is for Stella, except that Stella was more subtle, making the absurd comedy funny. It worked better, and I suppose, a little more of a fantastic realistic view. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that some reviews are so negative (I'm very skeptical about the critical honor but don't challenge fan reaction) to this show is the amount of ads on it, very unpleasant ads through Many apps advertise by far for other apps. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman has a career, and others are even more bitter when better performances are canceled. This show never had to make it past the unaired pilot stage. Back to Norm showed much more promise, but this performance continues. And as the critics are right, many things are universally incorporated, seeing that their status has risen steadily. Last checked, Britney Spears also gets great reviews. Take that equation you want, because somebody will undoubtedly accuse me of being psychotic on IMDb because I don't like this presentation.
