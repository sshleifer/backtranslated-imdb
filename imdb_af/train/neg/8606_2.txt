I love killer Insects movies they are great to watch, I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I met him and I wish I had listened to him if this movie was terrible as he said after saying that I was still dead to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> The plot: People die mysteriously and horribly, and no one has an idea What the cause is. <br /> <br /> Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution but his authorities on murderer slugs are laughing. <br /> <br /> Only when the body setting starts. To get up and start walking around a snail expert from England, Mike seems to have the right idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most offensive thing you ever see a movie! Snails in this movie are fast (then normal) and they seem to be sending the screens fast forward! <br /> <br /> This movie is not like the book, the book was ten times scarcer, ten times gory and had many more stories about it! <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie smoothly! Since I'm a big fan of Slugs, the book and the second book is called Teelgrond! Both books are wonderful. Read the book and then watch the movie. You may be more than I did. Give this 2 out of 10
