Terrible ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen very nice photos over the past few years. The sound sucks, so the quality of the picture, the direction, the acting, etc. Etc. The only good shoots (which mean funny because they are so bad) are the special effects. Overall there are about 5 minutes to laugh. The rest of the movie gives you brain damage.
