This movie was just hacked by MST3K and for good reason. First, because it's a "cop" movie with Joe Don Baker, who we all know, is about as good as a cop actor, as Michael Jackson is a nationwide singer. <br /> <br /> All the typical police officers behind their ugly heads, bar fights, kids hostage in shoot outs, bad acting, lame police chiefs, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless goons and of course bad acting. Don't see it without a MST3K filtering people.
