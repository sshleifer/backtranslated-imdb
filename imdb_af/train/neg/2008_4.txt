No mention was made of Ann Rivers Siddons adapting the material for "The House Next Door" of her 1970s title with the same title or anyone else. This lifetime-like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version that was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when critical moments precede the ads, which of course cannot be viewed in this version. <br /> <br /> The movie's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who curves a new look throwing this viewer through the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, me. Boyle is barely recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character in the middle of the mystery. It wasn't one of the actress's better moments in front of the camera. This applies to the rest of the Canadian actors who have earned better. <br /> <br /> The film has a cross between 'Desperate Houswives' and 'The Stepford Wives', and other well-known features combined with a light dose of creepiness. The best thing about the movie was the house that serves as the environment.
