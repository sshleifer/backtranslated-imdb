I am a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was nice to see Oskar Werner at Fahrenheit 451, but this episode has been missing. The original plot and plot twists were obvious and can be consulted in advance, even years before the modern detective of today. But it was amusing to see the crazy banking patterns and the "modern" electronic equipment and of course the compulsory suburban humor is fun to buy on modern art. The hi-tech home is a Jetson or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and it's nice to think of authors who find out-out gizmos. <br /> <br /> If it is sunny outside, will play, because there are much better Columbo episodes. Still, we should be grateful for Cable TV that these episodes are broadcast.
