I saw it for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson who think they are girlfriends policemen. They are but Busey is in the opening scene and does not appear in the movie for more than 40 minutes. Even though every scene he's in is wonderful. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind oboe. <br /> <br /> What is incredible about this movie is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who is stopping and killing the telephone sex operators. At one point I think it's his Busey. But it seems that I'm just partially right. Busey is not the killer, but he calls the women over the phone. Why? I do not know. He is in no way connected to the killer, he just does it for kicks.
