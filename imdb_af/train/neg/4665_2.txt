I wanted the The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character sets, Ewan Macgregor in the completely glorious whole. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway has become so enriched with the presentation of the movie, not for the film's benefit. I won't even be in Vivian Wu's deadly action. <br /> <br /> You are derived from the story of 4 billion teenage windows and calligraphy scrolling at the bottom of the screen, displaying the lyrics of the music playing. He seems to have lost sight of presenting the real story and developing the plot, and has become entangled with foo-foo decorations that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GROOTMA loves me!" in great sparkling letters. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like it was an accident from the director's author's ego instead of what it could be - disturbing and terribly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it is best associated with fine art classes that also take them seriously.
