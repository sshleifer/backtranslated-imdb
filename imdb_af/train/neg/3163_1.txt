Well, this is the first post ever to comment on IMDb., Get it, this movie has made me warn and warn all the good souls that will ever stop experimenting with movies. <br /> <br /> Like most of them, they commented. I thought to watch this movie because it looked like there were some decent actors (although I read the worst critics against this movie), I thought to experiment with the fact that it was a comedy movie is. Well, it started well with a few ahem. Comedies ... It all begins pathetic ... Man you can believe yourself, you feel like going and banging your head every time the pathetic search woman is called the heroine of the movie, is made helpless. Well, how good one can consume a sick, all the witches spiritual ghost, try to do everything she can to annoy you and stop you from what you do. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing about The movie is the "ZOMBIE" hero, yes, if he loses his fiance, he walks around like a goat with black dots. under his eyes. And with the hero's "terribly stupid" sister. You will bleed from head to toe as you try and manage to watch this movie completely ~!
