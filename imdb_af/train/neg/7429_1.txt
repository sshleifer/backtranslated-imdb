Who am I? No, I'm not joking. This is what it really says on the video box. <br /> <br /> Plot; short version: Beautiful woman is smiling. For some reason all men kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Look for Ariel ... Where's Ariel ... Can't Ariel find ..." She's right behind you, your idiot. . <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this horrible little Space Opera has already been said. It looks like. <br /> <br /> A lot of crazy actors who mostly condemn, come to the first selection of actors is turned off very quickly. Then they are beaten in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes from the scene. Perhaps it was a sign of straws to see which actors have the most screen time and bigger pay. The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch seems physically powerless and does nothing. Why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her "teleporting vampire" routine? (Actually, it would have been more interesting if she was a vampire or doing more than just looking at people, that's all she ever does. It's enough to kill each other's men ...) /> <br /> It's not really a speck. There are far more shots of the old western route, the 1950's Easy Rider route, Film noir's nightclub scene, even a jungle on the beach in fantasy land, with no true depth at all. The nightclub scene is, of course, black and white. Work with "The Wizard of Oz". Don't work as well here. This is probably a good thing, as the few shots they see from space are depressed. You will probably cry in those moments, especially if you see that the whirling "spacecraft" looks about three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are convicted or have personality, but because they need serious acting, except for Billy Dee Williams who looks really depressed and with loss, probably in this job ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, when seen with friends, will cause a very "silent" noise, especially when the nerd is trying to make a comic one. liners throw (including the line over the French kiss of a meteorite ...? Did I hear it right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls get "murdered", nothing does not mean since they do not even really start. Well, the other "characters" are not, but they are next to the point. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that the scene that knew the video case was a kind of skull-horror stranger thing (green filter added on top of it, to make it more of a to give ... u ... green look), which is actually the android after being killed and ultimately nothing to do with anything else. <br /> <br /> Another weird deal I noticed. When there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes pixelated. I don't mean a small pixelated, I mean big blocks about 1/16 the size of the screen. Wow.
