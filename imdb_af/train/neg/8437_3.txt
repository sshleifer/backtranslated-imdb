As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his first film House of Games, which also played with Joe Mantegna, I expected great things from this movie. Instead, I was annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Race snake is reversed without any sense or meaning behind them, hoping to set up a racial tension that has never been to me. Identity is completely revalued and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Due to his oath as a policeman, the main character refuses to do a relatively small action that no one can damage and save lives, but still performs an action that is very violent and VERY illegal but still refuses the minor action. In addition, a highly incredible subplot in which a man who killed his family has simply been set up for the sake of an air-only plot point, and the police's response to the incident extends credibility beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after I expected an exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.
