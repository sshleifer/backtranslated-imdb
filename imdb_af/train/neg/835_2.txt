Watched both the Lion King and Lion King II and both thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for income. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they lost the deal with pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just picked up a few pieces of footage left on the editor. floor (or rubbish bin) and stick them together to make a quick goat. <br /> <br /> Unlike LK I & II, both had strong story lines. <br /> <br /> This movie has almost a story. While the characters and animation are always fun to watch, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original listings. <br /> <br /> Disney - Scan on to express this garbage to make a quick buck! <br /> <br /> Next time takes the time and effort and puts a lasting job.
