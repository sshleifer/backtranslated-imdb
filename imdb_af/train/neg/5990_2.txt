I haven't got it yet to see it all; It's now on the cable, and I still seem to be in the middle of it. My main reason I'm interested in is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; He is a pretty good actor and has consistently applied good work throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that while I was never really a fan of the old series, I worked on Thunderbirds for ships and effects. Derek Meddings may have been the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Rescue Boat are wonderful. The current team did a good job of translating its work on the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a lame story. The children are asked to manage it, and while they are doing a good job, it is difficult to suspend your unbelief, especially if you are the eight-year-old Brains son, who is flying T2, a huge multitone transport with all the aerodynamics of A buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is at the top, and it is irritating. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the movie on its very narrow merit, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Don't look too closely at the machinery it manages. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I finally got it all, and it's worse than I thought. The play is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are pretty good, the story has become more and more overlooked. The exaggerated product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters stir up my remaining nerves. As with the Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is portable. But not much. Look at the original view, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. On Telemundo. Double in Spanish, with casey comedy sound effects. And yes, I almost came in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their battlefield on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I didn't think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> If it's done straight, no kids-to-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, might have been. As it is, it's just another beloved childhood that has been devastated.
