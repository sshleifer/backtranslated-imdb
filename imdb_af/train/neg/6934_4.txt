OK, of course, ppl thinks it was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the fools who still think so ... His absolute rubbish. <br /> <br /> The story is just. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to be satirized. I'm sure it's a serious drama, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say Dean is wonderful in this movie, and maybe he played his part as well as what he could possibly have. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made this film. See him agonizing and throwing tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... his pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the early scenes at the police station where she cries and cries are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the movie ... and for the rest, you feel every time one of these badly activated emotional scenes comes together. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for his time, but really, his bravery. <br /> <br /> It should just be hype about Dean's death that overheated the reputation of this movie.
