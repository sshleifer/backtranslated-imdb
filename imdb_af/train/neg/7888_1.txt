didn't know anything about the movie, or that it was based on a best-selling book. It's been guessing from the opening styles what it's all about, best advice, buried treasure and deadline. It took about 15 minutes when I suspected the sneaky movie was crazy. I won't spoil you with how bad the plot and acting were, but anyone who gave it more than two stars should work for the filmmakers. I watched until the hero jumped into his corvettes to rush around. He arrived at the hospital on his suit, shirt and tie in the jeans and shirt / shirt. Can't get the continuity right. I have the Christian theme, it's hard to miss it.
