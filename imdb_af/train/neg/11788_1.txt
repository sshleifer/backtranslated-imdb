It was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I laughed at the whole movie! The plot was so cute; especially the end. This movie comes from an end-of-the-world disaster to save-the-eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eel! And there was this terrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters separated. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mother, my sister, and I couldn't finish it, and when we finished it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and finished this time, we made MST3K-like comments in the movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: Just look here if you're a movie basher! Make hilarious remarks, watch it for a laugh, and I mean LARGE laugh. Also look for ridicule. The metaphor that explains this movie: This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and socks!
