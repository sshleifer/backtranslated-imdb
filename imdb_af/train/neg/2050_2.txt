Not that a movie by Ulli Lommel filled me with hope, but I have to admit that ZODIAC KILLER has sunk among my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to use digital video for their early projects. It's good and good to give these kids the opportunity to create a job without spending all their money on expensive movie supplies. But many of these young filmmakers also have the idea of ​​filtering the final film so that it looks more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mockumentary" style, as it never looks like anything other than video. The primary problem lies in ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like a day opera about a killer. It doesn't feel like you're watching a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that it is virtually impossible to generate horror (or even tension!) On video. For the love of God this man has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has not improved over a forty-year career in the business. And we were lucky, he also wrote the script! So you can expect confusing actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plotement that will leave you completely dissatisfied. Please, miss this movie. You will thank me later.
