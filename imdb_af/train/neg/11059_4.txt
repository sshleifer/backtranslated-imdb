"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, although I don't use "horror" or "thriller", describe it. It is more of a minor character study that seems strange to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner portrays the killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed, killed and disrupted his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney, well played by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost the more interesting character: surprised by Dahmer and escaped an attack, returning to Dahmer for sex and surviving a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is unfounded because it is not too little to portray Dahmer's formative years, how events can create the human monster we see on the screen and give no insight into Dahmer's conviction that he can create sexual zombies from his victims. <br /> <br /> The roles are played well, but the story is thin.
