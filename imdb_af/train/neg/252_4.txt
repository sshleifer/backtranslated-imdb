Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in an attractive but mere adaptation, in which dialogue is considered rather than sincere, and that the ghost curtains do not gain the sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Christmas Ghost, blows silence and looks like Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is resentful, and he never really believes in it, robbing his performance of its effect. The screens in which he showed his past have so much impact as he flickers half-heartedly through his family album. No one else seems to have any trouble except Frank Finlay, who chronically overworked.
