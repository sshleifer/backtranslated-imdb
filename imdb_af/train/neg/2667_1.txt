California is disturbing. I believe there is no reason to tell this story. It is not entertaining or social value. Technically, the movie is very good, the performances are top rate and first class. The story develops in an intriguing way of interest. But in the end, this movie is sickens and horrible to decency. I do not recommend California to anyone.
