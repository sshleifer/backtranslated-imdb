A small daughter's dead body is exposed to all possible identification methods. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is supposed to be the body of a couple's missing daughter. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to sedatives and leads to an unfortunate existence. All these changes change one day, many years later, she receives a call from her daughter! With the help of an ex-cop and a reporter, she is on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess, moving at a very slow pace and is completely unsuitable. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an excellent job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the end, but I'm not sure it's worth the rest of the movie. Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 issue - they are not very accurate.
