It's been a while since I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but he's now the husband and Jude Law, his wife's lover. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic play. <br /> <br /> During the movie I always had the feeling of watching a play. This is one of the reasons why I don't like this classic reminder. When I watch a movie, a play fits what I still need to watch a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan has done wonderful movies in the past, but this time he missed out. Another reason was the appearance of the movie. The design was modern, stylish, uncomfortable and cold. I never felt like someone ever lived in that house. Photography was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes there was blue light, dark green light, not to make it friendly for eyes. <br /> <br /> The acting was really good. Michael Caine and Jude Law's actions are at their best. I'd like to see these two guys playing on stage. But I have to confess that I was never a fan of Jude Law. The worst part was the middle part. I remember it in the original that this passage was still very secretive and just wonderfully directed. I watched it twice and always in the middle part I fell asleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems more like a movie for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth (2007).
