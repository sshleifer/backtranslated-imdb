Most movies I can easily sit on, even if I don't like the movie anymore. I'm the kind of person who recognizes big movies, even though I don't like the genre. It's the first movie I couldn't see. Cat in the hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is good (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is VERY irritating). The stupid songs the cat sang were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot goes on and on, and viewers have to suffer from poor dialogue. The "witty" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comments about how to compare it, well, a kind of person who is a ho). Although the movie is very short, it seems to be forever. Don't waste your time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If children can't do that, I don't know how adults can. I would like to find out more about this movie, but I don't even feel like wasting more time writing this review. I hated it! So, in summary, don't spend 90 minutes of your life watching it! See a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever given a movie.
