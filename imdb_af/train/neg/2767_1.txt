This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - the previous most divine movie, "Spawn of Slithis," which I saw when I was about 10. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, stilted and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, mishmashed cut scenes, even the music was annoying. Did I leave something out? Well, the special effects weren't bad, but CGI doesn't make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I actually spent money watching this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (the director), please send it to my username "at gmail," and I will contact him to personally claim a refund.
