Well, I suppose the good news about William Winckler's 2001 opus, "The Double-D Avenger" is that he succeeds in getting three of Russ Meyer's mammary wonders - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in a photo united. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were shooting this thing this week ... or else a copy of the script got ahead!) The bad news, though (and there are many of them) ), this is the movie - if it can even be said to have been shot straight to the video - it's a complete blast, a total abortion, an excessive horror, an absolute horror, and one of the worst photos I've ever seen. Look no further for the funniest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, as it is, deals with Kitten who gets superpowers after seizing the rare kazazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer and later fight a trio of megalunged bikini dancers in LA. Too bad that every lame boobs a joke that is trampled down completely (you have to forgive the expression), that there is no real nudity in the movie anywhere (except some old Kitten photos in her blossom), and that some shaving cream and a paper-mache stone the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer Gals here is a bit long in the teeth / saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as a bikini girl, Ooga Boobies (!), Manages to stand out. So why did I give this young, unfunny, failed embarrassment to a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be brief: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over comments in the special features of the DVD I just watched are absolutely hilarious, especially if he pulls out about 100 synonyms from the 1000's on his "Canonical Hooters List" from the word "breast". The man is a national treasure, and he is able to upgrade this slice of a disk to the newspaper status!
