It's never going to surprise me how you can take an excellent actor and waste him in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he can't save this movie. In fact, his character is very similar to the one he played in Cape Fear, which was pretty good, but I can't resist if actors do the same slide over more than one movie. I believe it's getting old, and it's here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this movie, but then the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player and shows his imagination in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than entertainment. <br /> <br /> But because De Niro is in this movie, it makes a sign if you are a fan who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at its best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land", or even go back and look at "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Don't waste your time with these drives. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
