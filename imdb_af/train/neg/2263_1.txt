Okay, let me say I didn't expect a movie with Jerry Springer to be the movie of gold. All I asked was that it was theater ... and it wasn't even that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. Poorly performed, written and filled to the brim with nakedness of the most unnecessary people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie's "plot" focuses on a low-class family who decide to discuss the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss various issues between a mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter's fiance. From there, the film is fizzles and developed into a unique experience: white-rubbish pornography. There is redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and humiliating. African Americans and working class America must take offense. (However, Howard Stern must be satisfied, he did not waste his attempt at movie stars. She was smart, funny and entertaining) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (the girl was hot)
