It's not one of the reviews on poor special effects or technology, or it is dated, problems with which only the drorkets can relate, but rather a review of the story we are most interested in. <Br /> <br /> The plot is about a combination of World War II Allied and German naval members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine) who are merged together into a German U-boat and into a wild land dinosaurs come. <br /> <br /> The manipulations aren't as bad by movie standards, and we know from the plot that realism won't be high. What movies like this need are credible and fun characters, along with some reason in the action. <br /> <br /> This movie misses both. For a full length movie, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are barely watched. McClure's hero is out of routine and doesn't make much sense in any era. <br /> <br /> The female looks for an answer to a mystery about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the mystery is not much of a mystery, and we can take less care. <br /> <br /> Much failure in a movie that had to be better even for its time.
