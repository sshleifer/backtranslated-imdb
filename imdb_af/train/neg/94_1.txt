THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories that include carnivorous zombies claimed to haunt the area. <br /> <br /> An ABSOLUTE waste of time has been key to Haggerty's painful amateur performance from the start. Worse still, the two stories that make up the bulk of run time are completely routine, made worse by careless actions and a thin direction by Brad Sykes, who was previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). It's not a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (at least he believed in what he did and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' homemade movies are actually aggravating, boring and almost completely without any good virtues, and most viewers will feel justified and deceived by such an unimaginable, messy mess. The 3-D format is completely wasted here.
