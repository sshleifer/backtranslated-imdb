i love horror movies, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's .. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror movie? let's compare it with titles in a similar family. the haunting, the varying, the shining. or for a similar technology based horror movie that FAAAR better (but still far from big) Demon Seed. OK, I'll be fair. Let's compare it to TV horror movies! Don't go to sleep. Awake, better and better. Salem's fate, the night-watchdog, night-gallery, even in the basement or crowhaven farm was far better. * SPOILERS * In the first place, as good as a scene like the bloody shower scene, you have a scene like the opening scene. Oh boy! the garden hose comes alive to drop some fresh teens! Awful. Also, just what we understand from home. It should apparently use its video cameras to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional home. not a spirit or devil or entity, it is a "owned" house, but by what? we are led to learn a lifeless object that has been taught to love suzie / margaret, our protagonist? now that I'm on the subject of suzie. Another scene that bothered me all the time, this poor old mad lady, telling you she's your nurse, throwing her heart out, falling into the cooking pool, struggling for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? did she risk burning her hands to save this poor elderly woman who came to warn her life? no, she's standing there watching! the acting for the most part was better than the average for a horror movie, but that is where the positive ends. For at least a more interesting, and funny horror movie about a lifeless object that kills people, look at deathbed: the bed that eats. I feel the people who have so much appreciated it or have not watched it, as it was originally broadcast, or remember that it scares them as children. this movie was pretty much less merit.
