Former brat-pack actor and Robinda star, a fine boy, has been filmed in a US American prison. I had a feeling that his character would be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series OZ, but PROXIMITY is not such a movie, it's more like a "Man on the Run" movie like DIE fugitively. It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn making a cameo as the justice spokesman for the victims of the victims, but becoming an intelligent discussion on how society should deal with criminals. totally ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car hunters
