Whoever wrote the "nice" message about this had to have been a friend of these guys. It's bad even for the backyard. In fact, it's not even the backyard struggle, it's a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Every guy is about 45 pounds wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment in it. It is just a few bored children who even give a bad name if possible. If you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestles, Backyard Wrestling picks up a pleasure for pain. It stars the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They actually went since they got it and were professionally trained as "real" pro wrestlers. They became legit and became better. I recommend checking out the 2 guys. MDogg is mad and off the hook. So don't waste your time or money on this crazy DVD, there are 'better' backyard videos out there.
