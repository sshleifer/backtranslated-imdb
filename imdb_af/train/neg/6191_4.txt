I watched this movie, along with every other adaptation, I could get my hands on - seeing plays - in preparation for academic research. The cinematography moves a lot, just like the music. Unfortunately, all life has been taken from the story. I have never had such a terrible portrayal of Mr. Rochester not seen. All his most fundamental qualities are gone. Where is she white? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester looks more like Rochester's foil, St. John, than the character of the novel. In fact, the actor who plays St.John in this adaptation has played a passionate St.John, while Scott has content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they think. I would like to give this movie a slightly higher voice based on great music and cinematography, but frankly I can't show this movie too long because of George C. Scott's performance.
