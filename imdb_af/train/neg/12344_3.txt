Extensive comedy, a sketchy revue that was initially a vehicle to show once-off radio star Jack Pearl, but is now best remembered as America's launch to The Three Stooges. Actually, Larry, Curly and Moe are billed alongside Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although supporting role-player Jimmy Durante (who has been wasted on dull material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the film these days, Stooges addicts are, and even they won't be complaining much about this. Incredibly hard and overwhelming, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
