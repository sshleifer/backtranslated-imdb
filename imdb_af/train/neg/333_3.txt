I remember when the GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986, it was universally criticized by the critics and I speak so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy, so I think this movie has something to do with it. <Br /> <br /> It is going to be a bad start where Buddhist monks kneel before a child with an empty expression on his face. Bad guys enter the monks <br /> <br /> Kids sit with blank expression <br /> <br /> <br /> <Bad guys pull out giant birdhouse and keep the kid in, who sits together ... Go guess? You get the impression that even if they tackled him for an overnight at Michael Jackson's wonderland farm, he still gives the same empty expression. This movie will be better named THE WOOD CHILD <br /> <br /> The title sequence starts and a 1980s movie a pop soundtrack is tough. It was clear that it was cool and funky at the moment, but now it looks very dated in 2004. Not only that, but it's quite with the somewhat bloody opening. In fact, this is the main problem (And the boy is a serious one) with this movie. The whole mood looks so much from scene to scene so sometimes scenes seem to be clicked from different movies. I blame the director personally, but it should also be pointed out that both the scriptwriter and producer must share equal debt. Did anyone know before shooting started, what kind of movie would it be? This is part of the fantasy, part of the martial arts, a part girl movie, part comedy and that's all the crap
