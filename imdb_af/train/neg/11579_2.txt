I have to admit, I don't remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure there was one, I was so annoyed by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it. How do you call a movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then movie in Texas? The flat desert land around Arlington (I think it was the place) doesn't look like the green rolling hills around Tulsa, and a Tulsa celebrity would have a much nicer place to live. Obviously no one in the movie ever was around Tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even looked. Didn't anyone ever see Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know it sounds picky, but I can't help it. I watched it because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors couldn't make this winding and significant story of self-confident people NOT in the country alive! I'm sorry, it can't be more expensive to film in Oklahoma. What if "shot and die in LA" was shot in Toronto? Would it suck? Well, it does.
