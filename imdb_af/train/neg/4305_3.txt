I watched this movie a while ago on a Video CD. <br /> <br /> I'll mention the good points first. <br /> <br /> At least, the movie tries to see that it's not biased, such as not displaying one character like black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and do well in a non-prosperous country and economy while not failing. Their families come together and parties and they practice their favorite sport, sports shooting, as comrades not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes, the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that these friends should hate one another for some unknown reason. It is for unknown reason that Bosnia is now heading for conflict. Certainly, the writing adds in TV recordings that the characters seem to be watching live news programs in English, but the tracks were not in 1992 when the war started. <br /> <br /> History, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film is trying to blame Karadzic, who was a presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament's 2nd Largest Party (SDP). According to the Bosnia Constitution, the SDP would have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a prominent referendum in March declaring the Bosnia law and announcing Secession. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from "STtH". He was a student of Nazism in World War II. He even wrote his own Mein Kampf in which he declared: "There is no peace or coherence between the Islamic Religion and non-Islamic social and political institutions." <br /> <In 1990, he lost the IDAP elections to Fugret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who was a former Yugoslav Muslim, who worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War, and who treated his supporters like brothers. Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election but grabbed the chair. <br /> <br /> The events above are missing from the movie, but these are the factual events that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. Serbian soldiers in the movie wore Soviet WW2 helmets, which they did not use. The one soldier also had an M-1944 WW2 gun that is not used by the USSR only Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and writers had a chance, but they chose to rewrite history.
