Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me some credit. This movie was worthy. Useless and time consuming What a waste of energy and totally useless. Well, I understand the point of departure and the idea sounds, but give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mother's remorse, guilty man! Clich√© ja ~! Get a life! Sorry, but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I'd rather cook eggs! No real explanation why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious, but why? Acting deserves What do I do here, Oscar and cinematography? Am I just for a wage? How much did this movie make? Well, this stupid fool hired a copy. Enough said
