* Can some kind of fairy tale contain? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to give a kid in the bush. His distinctive appearance in Back to the Future, as George McFly sealed his conscience forever. More recently, he tried to get back into the culture subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin made a 76-minute, inexpensive dada movie. Sometimes it reminded me of genius, while generally insulting me, but not because of its contents. Contents? What is it? is a movie in which half of the movie has all the actors Down's Syndrome, giving it a freakshow feel. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey, and a man with cerebral palsy. This made everyone feel what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living, and at the same time felt more successful and failed. <br /> <br /> Half of the Down's Syndrome actors also contain many many killed snails. It's about a man who has snails, and ends up killing one. He is also plagued by a lot of other people, and a locust. He falls in love with 2 girls, of whom he has sex in a cemetery. He also fell out with a friend who bothered him. <br /> <br /> In a strange semi-interior, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. He is something like controlling the mind of the guy, and the cerebral handicapped man is something like sexuality. Well, he is at least masturbating in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" images that made humorous, such as Nazi Swaztikas who crossed the Shirley Temple, and minstrels in the black face said they were Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the tormentor still deals with his love of killing snails and being beaten by others. They beat him with rocks, and so. Later they hit the minstrel after hearing him. <br /> <br /> Back to the interior, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set, trying to control everyone, but fails. <br /> <br /> What is it? makes less sense than dr. Caligari, and has more than a passing style stolen from it. The claustrophobic spiritual space feels very much like the way the nostrils of Dr. Caligari claustrofoob feel. They also had some dialogue that was absolutely nonsense. And it was all with an absurd cartoon for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? run out of imagery. For the next 56 minutes, we keep on the same set of images, just new images in the form of an absurd puppet show. The movie looks little more than a movie that attempts to push the envelope into offensive and taboo images. It tries to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that it only has enough different images for a 40 minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse than that, cinematography, set design and everything else are very cheap and almost unplanned. It feels like "OK, that's the way we can do it and get it out." It didn't feel interesting, and was rather boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had wonderful cinematography and framework. The difference between the two is pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> Rating: C
