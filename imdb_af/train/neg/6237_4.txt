The statistics in this movie have been well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore definitely does his job very well and it is no wonder that this movie has the praise that it got. Al Gore is definitely quite an actor. He sounds so worried. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, political jokes and references to his political career have spread throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike Al Gore, Jimmy Carter is a man of integrity who not only speaks, but also walks. When Carter thought we should save energy, he switched off the thermostat in the White House and warmed up by wearing a jersey. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and demand global warming while traveling on its own private plane. How much energy does her jet use and how much more pollution does she make? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's pool behind its home? It will be nice if we can save electricity by using smaller devices and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the power company would respond to a 50% reduction in energy by calling it a "50% loss in revenue" and recovering its losses by raising rates by 50%. So, "just to turn it off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a veiled appeal to enable Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of the saving of planet earth, that is.
