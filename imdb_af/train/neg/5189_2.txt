This series would have been much better if they just did one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Boom. Diamond Head the character needs someone who can handle the role of the sweet villain, which McShane proved he could do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond Head, is actually in the role. McShane is not really as good as the bad old man. France Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, does not seem to be the unfortunate victim or the difficult and fair woman. She eventually earned her wages when she played the role of Diamond Head's lover. After watching an episode or two, I didn't mind what happened to anyone. Boom gives us a lot to hate him, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to love him. Unfortunately, in the 1970s, the spies were not quite like the 1960s.
