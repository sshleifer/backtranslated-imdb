I watched the Malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which, in turn, was inspired by an English film of the same name) long ago. The basic story of Garam Masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way. The classic jokes are replaced by routine Hindi movie appearances (probably the director did it to suit the taste of the Hindi audience). <br /> <br /> I didn't see the English original. But really enjoyed the Malayalam movie (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a brand new comedy at the time. Of course, the acting of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the cook's role) is so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Probably, I'm defeated by the Malayalam movie I can't endure the smaller mistakes his Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham looked too much. Paresh Rawal did a decent job - but didn't reach anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But everything is fine when compared to other recent Hindi comedy films.
