There was something here with the female head to have this perfect life. She is always popular for the worst life possible, starting as a child prostitute and winding up with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and it destroys it in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position Dean Dean Cain in the end and the choice he made. He can't hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of his child. (I think the timings make it clear that it's his child and not his brother), but immediately he can't forgive her for everything she did. sleeping with his brother (who was the love and obligation he felt was actually one way) and then part of his death. In better hands it would have been a better movie, but for something I caught on the nightmare, it's not bad.
