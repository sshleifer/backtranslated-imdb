I don't know what to say about this terrible movie that hasn't been said yet. Honestly, I just have myself to be angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie, that it would be a horrible piece of shit, but I loved War Games, so I surprised my impression. I will regret the decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when the government explained that their super computer could determine who was a terrorist just by how well they played a video game, I knew I was in a ride, although the well-written country forgot . The list of many, very bad plot lines, dialogue and acting is so long that I will break into IMDb if I try to put it. For the people who said they saw the worst movies this one, please tell me. I'm actually curious to see something that this steaming pole can cross.
