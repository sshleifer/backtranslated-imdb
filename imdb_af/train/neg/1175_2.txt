Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to fill the background. Sometimes it works well, the scene where Grace and her maid witness far off the King's performance is particularly striking. At other times, it gives the film a strange amateur look that looks like a home video. The big failure, however, is that the mere artificiality of the mise and scene creates an alienation effect in the viewer. We know that what we look at is not really, how can we feel for the characters? To be honest, I did not cry at all about what happened to the Lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> The other major failure I regret to say is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead. She is based on virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film. OK she speaks a foreign language, but she is unable to express true emotion. Her emotion in the scene where she told her friend, Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by debut Helena Dubiel) who saw the head on a pole, caused an audience embarrassment in public. Also look at her hands when expressing emotion! <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disappointing movie, especially the positive reviews on this site.
