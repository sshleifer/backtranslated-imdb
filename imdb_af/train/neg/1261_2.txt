I'm a Jean Harlow fan because she's got star quality. I don't think her movies are good and I don't even think she was a good actress, but she was definitely great in comedies. Every piece of comedy in The Girl of Missouri is very good. But this movie may be more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget about the rest of the cast. Their performances bring nothing new. It always impressed me to think that Harlow's beautiful body is a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looks pretty.
