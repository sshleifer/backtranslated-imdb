Absolutely horrible movie. Ameteurish and it's not funny at all. Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Editors by E.T and star wars is not stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good thinker about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can't find an actor with his attributes. Unlike Goksal, this movie is a garbage. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this film is his worst written work to this date. <br /> <br /> The music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also has some presence. Actor playing the three boys has no talent.
