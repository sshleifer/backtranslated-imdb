I absolutely don't miss seeing what is funny in this movie. The humor seems to be destined for bodies. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not increase much sympathy, aside from some non-important characters. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers of this script think? "Oooo funny! Let's make an old old lady's tall pot! Let's make them .... giggle! Let's make them ... act like little kids! Oooo, yes, it's absolutely brilliant and original!" <br /> <br /> This film made me most annoyed by all the movies I've seen in the past five years.
