In Providence, Rhode Island, Die Massa Voer, is seeking a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, it could be applied to how the US tried to control the media during the war in Iraq, but it felt hollow. There is never real tension in the story and the play is never very good. The worst, the direction of the movie is horrible, focusing more on strange camera angles that do not convey anything. "It's not a strange way to hold the camera." Special effects are pretty bad ... at one point, the video of a blast was sifted green over the city, and it's at best ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie has some bright spots ... namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a recycling service and a party bus). But it's too much to make the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Stitch and Creep. It has the same poor production value, but there is much more humor, humor and talent for it.
