I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some are forfeit in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this movie was boring. I often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that only showed a typical day or time period that didn't really matter. Now that I've seen such a movie, I won't be thinking about the lines anymore. There are sounds about society, racism and a desire ... but South Park has it. And when I look at South Park, it's actually moving me an emotion. The closest thing I felt during this movie was the gift I experienced after the first five minutes. I classify the typical movie a seven or higher because I love most of each movie. I gave this movie a one.
