I recently saw it with my wife and discovered that it is better than Caine believes, although it is not much cop. Britain's biggest screen saver does not seem to be interested in this role, it is a pity that he raised it with more conviction in his game. Rex Harrison looks even less uncomfortable, perhaps not surprising, as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is short, and again his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but has been given very little to do, the movie can be much gained by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically plays a cartoon that is completely out of the movie's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif is one of his many useless cameos (his career has been based here for decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer must be accused of not directing it effectively, he was an unpredictable film director, and one of his weaker films.
