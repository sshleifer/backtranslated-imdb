I'm not sure if Carpenter wants questions about abortion, and makes the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should allow an abortion if Satan is the father, but it pulls on and off. Ron Perlman is laughing. The baby really looks stupid, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You can see the material on the Satan costume pretty much. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of the story and 55 minutes of the tedium. Very, very bad. And the end is not ridiculous. After learning that his baby was dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a big, bloody, turbulent riot? NO! He just stuck his head down and swallowed the room. Awful.
