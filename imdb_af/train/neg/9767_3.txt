I think if you're in the sixties sort of thing, like I am, you're bound to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this scarcely risky train track. The savvy gifts of this stranger include a surprisingly suitable social commentary in the sixties along with a number of relatively well-known actors who were captured earlier (and embarrassingly) images. It is as if the producers of Laugh-In have sat down and decide to write a full movie covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, and then put it in the hands of a few hippies and give them a $ 10,000 budget to complete it. Almost a classic, but in its own way, it goes without saying how strange that time was, the sotiness, the over-idealism and the withdrawal of the business. This is clearly not for everyone.
