I gave up trying to find out which version of this I am watching. The copyright at the end points to 1983. And although this is not the important part of my objection to this movie, I would say it is a movie made for granted in the Aquarius era (including long-haired hippie and boring station wagons), but with a 1980s soundtrack is disturbing. Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is HOW TO LIVE THE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN. HOW DARE THEM. <br /> <br /> Certainly she is like lovely things, but in the two movies I saw her - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent Legend or Hell House - kill them. <Br /> <br /> I would like to alert the movie industry. Pamela Franklin apparently retired from the business, but if she ever decided to make another movie and a little bit of a director trying to kill her, I would have to leave him. <br /> <br /> Nobody knocks on PAMELA FRANKLIN AND GET IT IT. I AM QUITE CROSS. THE FURY IS RELAXED. <br /> <br /> For B-movie fans looking for a crapfest, you can do much worse than that. On the positive side, it is not a movie involving Satanism in a peripheral and prudent way. This movie is a hardcore satanic movie. <br /> <br /> Wall-to-wall satanic ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ridiculous gear attack - what else can you ask for. <br /> <br /> These excellent things are almost ruined by the baffling-grafted-in-the-syn soundtrack, which is about as mismatched as a movie. The soundtrack reminded me of something you would hear on The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> They also squashed Pamela Franklin's charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel abomination (against the viewer) as you might find under the Universal Declaration. of human rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice. Who is with me? I could forget about this movie if they didn't abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I throw the gauntlet, sir - Someone with PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES WITH MY PENALTY. <br /> <br /> Even in a fictional context. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
