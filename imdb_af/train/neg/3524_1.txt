This is one of the worse cases of movie drift I've seen long ago. It's so terrible that I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' as he puts a decent performance on his side. But that plot ... Oh, dear oh dear. I especially like the end of the end that he can pop from the base of a mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on its way. A day or two climbs him for five minutes! I can go on: but it's not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five-year-old can predict the outcome), the rest is. Sorry, but it's about as bad as film.
