End of the world is an insignificant film, which is strange because it is about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a kind of scientist, I don't know exactly what kind. He has two jobs at a government (?) Facility guarded by four security men. His first job is to monitor transmissions to and from space (although it looks more like a hobby he does if he doesn't work at work 2). Job # 2 requires him to wear a protective suit and go into a dark room ... at least it's the best I can figure out. Apparently, the plant is not exactly top secret, as the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they are heading for a meal) while discovering a message of space: Major Earth Disruption, repeat and over. He says something of this is the first message from the space he could ever decode; his wife told him they were going for dinner. So they go away and go to the party (!?!). Moments later, he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but it really doesn't help much. Besides, Lee gives a bright performance in the line of his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements you might want to suffer from if you want Christopher Lee or Z-grade sci-fi. In addition, there is much stock of earth that is being destroyed.
