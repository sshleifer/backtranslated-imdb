It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR Trilogy. But it was one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL VIEW. I do not doubt for a second that there are people who want this sense of humor, but there are better parodies on movies by well-known directors such as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. I work in a kiosk and in a DVD store and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: In the movie it was a good (but not great) success during the first two weeks but when the reviews From those what it saw was not too good, the film dropped very quickly. In DVD sales it was good for a short time, but no one asked it anymore. In the last decade, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one is worse, but I'm glad there are so many good movies, so I don't have to think too much about this question.
