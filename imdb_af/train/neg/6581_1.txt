I hired "New Best Friend" and hoped for a movie similar to pleasant teen thrillers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd" in which there is no tension and the acting is incredibly ominous. "New best friend" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
