It is a movie that is consumed. On the one hand, we are offered a tough outward look, a story that not only distracts the Catholic Church, but it does foolishly and uninformedly. On the inside, we are presented with a story of orthodoxy over orthophax, and what happens if people blindly follow a faith they should not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it turned out it was a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang opens a dictionary because he clearly doesn't understand the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; The humor was uncomfortable and poorly rendered. In particular, Miss Keaton's performance is brief and top, much under the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of consciousness, with her noisy voice and style. All of this can be forgiven if it wasn't the last 20 minutes of this movie. It was apparently a controversial game made in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Cautious, spoilers for *** *** /> ​​<br /> It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius is, by the way, a male name, and a nun will not accept it after her vows under any circumstances merely because of that fact merely to show how much unforgivable research has begun in the project.) When they all acknowledge that they do not comply with the church's teachings , the sister went on to become irrational and abused them in a way the audience believed she had returned when she was in the weird, all-too-cliché sepia-tone flashbacks. When one of them acknowledges having two abortions, the nun becomes even more insulting until the pupil pulls out a gun. After hiding it from her, the nun killed the pupil, presumably in self-defense. She then went on a screaming rampage and killed a gay former student for his sins. The last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a Christian position, as a cross is hanging over a cross. Can you say "heavily handed"? I knew you could! <br /> <br /> I know there have been abusive nuns in the past and I know that many people are emotionally disadvantaged, but these images are fed into our throat in almost every other shot. in this train wreck a movie. I heard from the author and the director that it is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously, no pun intended. However, this explanation is difficult to swallow, simply because we are never given an authoritative stance that has not been biased in some way to Catholic faith. This movie is simply anti-Catholic trips, which are moderate and hateful in the name of equity and equality. <br /> <br /> This is a movie I recommend for a Catholic, namely to wake him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they are experiencing today. If it explains 'Rabbi Ray everything' or 'Imam Mohammed explains it all,' there will be riots in the streets and Showtime will lose all its entry. But unfortunately, because it is a film that stands out against what is considered the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same, haunting view. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope every member of the role was a practicing Catholic, so it was not just ignorance they brought to make this movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, poorly targeted and just a bad movie in general. Don't waste your time.
