The main reason for seeing Red Eye is Rachel McAdams, a star-show, and Jayma Mays, who is great as the Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy persuaded so badly that he was being cartooned. The rest of the movie is dug with plot holes. I'll expand it further. <br /> <br /> Please do not read further if you do not want to know what happens! <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the plot. Rachel McAdams' character (Lisa) manages a hotel where the new stubborn homeland security director plans to stay that night. Rachel comes back to Miami from a funeral, but pushes calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. Meanwhile, someone outside her father's home, Joe (played by Brian Cox), is ready to kill him as Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All that Lisa has to do is call the hotel and move the director's suite to one where Jackson's cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family . <br /> <br /> Here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle loses the phones the plane their connection. Lisa tries to decay that she makes the call, but coincidentally, a man over the passage of Jackson, also makes a call and starts his phone to indicate it's dead. Jackson catches and grabs Lisa's phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson's head shot, Lisa and she, of course are eliminated ... only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa a note on the mirror in the (exceptionally large) toilet, and he beats her a little. Wonderful, the only one who hears anything is an 11-year-old girl whose word is obviously discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabbed Jackson with a pin in the throat as the plane landed, stealing his cellphone and making a jab for the exit, adjusting the passage between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite the fact that there is a passenger with a pen in his throat, the refugees obligate Lisa to open the door for the jet. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all reasonable (if not highly unlikely). But here's where it really gets stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at the Miami airport, and there is no cellphone signal (every major airport in America has a large cellphone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in pursuit, and no security officers even delay them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa in the airport, while turning the train from the gates to the terminals, lost his voice from the pen in his throat, but he can still understand be. But he didn't bother calling his husband outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at the Miami airport, but the one they showed looked a lot like the Orlando airport.) <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and drives away . Of course, this time when she makes a call, the phone says "low battery" and is turned off quickly (when will it stop using this inane plotter?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone still says "low battery", Lisa reached her assistant in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the director was moved. Of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded by 3 sides of the ocean. The missile could probably be launched in the first suite, thus denying the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What's the story here? Was the Director's original 38th floor room one of the only rooms in the hotel with a common view? Still, everyone comes out just before the missile hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa drives to Joe's house to just save her dad to see the killer out. Although she is overpowered (as he shoots at her) by plugging her Jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to find or stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson joins Joe's house and knocks him out (we don't see how ... maybe another head shot). He then explained to Lisa that he had not yet killed his father because he wanted dad Lisa to first see death. (Give me a break. What is it? Saturday morning cartoons?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson Lisa rushes around the house, and she fights him fiercely. Of course, a real killer (ie one who may be played by Jason Statham) may have done with Lisa (or anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. In the course of this chase Jackson stops at least once without bothering him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jackson dominates, and he's about to kill Lisa when you guess. He was shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So, here's my suggestion ... tells Wes Craven to hold on to the horror. Or maybe he should go with Michael Bay (who controls the equally stupid "The Island") and "Red Island".
