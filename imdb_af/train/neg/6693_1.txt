Away from this movie. Even through B movie standards, this movie is terrible. It is also treacherous in the theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and respect nothing for them are cool and worthy of admiration. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised much better than this movie, see it earlier. <br /> <br /> No ordinary child will do what Trent does. State troopers don't work the way they do in this movie. To see this movie, you realize why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche. Mija is a totally unsympathetic hooker, who has, yes, had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person who cannot identify the audience with her. <br /> <br /> Usually, one movie can be recommended. There is no one in this case. It's such a ridiculous movie, it insults the person trying to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate through B movie standards and the direction does not offer anything new or interesting.
