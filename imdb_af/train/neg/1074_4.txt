I never had to start this movie and stopped watching 3/4. I missed the actual blocked end. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. It had a nice atmosphere, top position and director, good places. But a baaaaaad story line, a bad writing. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - it was better than writing. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting in unreal and unlikely ways. Nobody acts like these outside Hollywood scripts.
