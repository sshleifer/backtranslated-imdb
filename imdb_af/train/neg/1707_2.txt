He was just happy to make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What the end result is is a lazy filmmaker who likes zombie movies. It would have been great if he just had a care. The end result is endless zoom ins on poor form, and even more poorly produced metal plays on it. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine high expectations, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work and one idiot behind the camera.
