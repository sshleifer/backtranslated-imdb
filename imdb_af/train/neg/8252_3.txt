Wattt was with the sound? It sounded like it was all bought. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad. Accents = bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, Sex scenes - bad / cringeworthy. <br /> <br /> Yet, we looked at it in disbelief until the end. How can such a good role call of actors do so badly? Will they ever get proper work again? <br /> <br /> Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, we gave it 3 because we were at least impressed to see it at the end because of the bizarre plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And to the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic 1940s farce. How did it make in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a nice boat. Jennifer looked nice in a small outfit. But how did the sister get all the men?
