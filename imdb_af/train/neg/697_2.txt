The two things are good about this movie, it's two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a movie, young and flexible, with a look that still covers her body today, steals the very beginning, that's all she is in and that is it. She is apparently just in the beginning, because her play has improved with her next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the score of then famous composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what this stinker likes from a single star ... yes, I know one star is not much, but in This movie's case is a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just stupid senseless horror of some college students trying to clean a dorm. It's because it's broken down, one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where it's going. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then make it off.
