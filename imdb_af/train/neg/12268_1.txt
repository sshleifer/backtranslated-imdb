I saw about four other Japanese horror movies and they weren't too impressive. However, I can feel that there is a meaningful script that shows the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. It's about a detective trying to connect similar murders. When he finds that a suspect is questioned, the suspect scares because they see a ghost. Then the ghost begins to follow the detective FOR A REASON WHICH IS NOT EXPLAINED AND HALF OF THE FILY. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The film has perspectives on different characters that do not deal with the story much. I've seen it before in other movies where it shows a different perspective. Not the case here. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens on the screen is actually tolerant. For example, there are a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and ... then it just cuts to another scene. I am aware that this can be a dramatic effect. It's certainly not the intention here. It's just bad editing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the "ghost" who just screams in a way that is not frightened or unintentionally funny. It is irritating and it happens a lot throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All the frightening people have been doing better in the past so you can see them all. Then, after one of them, the movie is over. At that stage, a wave of confusion wiped over the audience, because I felt we had all felt like we were wasting our time. Someone followed a cartoon and laugh. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, avoid.
