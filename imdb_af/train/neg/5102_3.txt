Nicole Eggert is listed as the star of this, despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being much bigger stars than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a turn on the "Alien Land on Earth" movie. Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for a stranger being chased by the army and in the turbulent being in her very sexy disguise. A little nudity and partial nudity, a senseless sex scene, has everything along the way. <br /> <br /> The movie crashes through a few obvious pieces and runs jokes about displaying photos. I loved the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and he has a very cool screen. <br /> <br /> It was pretty clear that Stacey Keach would be taken over and the movie had a bad end, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien has passed to Eggert.
