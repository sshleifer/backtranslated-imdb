OK, I really don't have too much to say about this movie, except this: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life, and over 2,300 of them were horror movies. While I am hard to decide what is best (unlike my favorite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero's DAY OF DEATH), I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH absolute is worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is simply nothing positive I can say about this movie. The acting, the dialogue, the direction, the make-up, the music ... Every aspect of this movie is just as far below what is acceptable for it to drop my mind that it has ever been released. <br /> <br /> Even if you're a horror or a zombie movie finalist, please keep my warning and don't waste your time on this garbage. There is no pleasure getting this viewing. You won't even put an end to the outstanding dissatisfaction. Trust me. Please.
