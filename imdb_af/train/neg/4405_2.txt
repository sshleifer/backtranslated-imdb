All I can say is, before I watched the movie, I didn't give an indication of who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was. And I have to admit that the movie was hardly a help to reach this data. And even it wasn't successful in persuading me to do research by typing a few words on google's website; But all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was big with her dumb facial expression, she really played well and showed a deep depression spiritual status, as it really is. <br /> <br /> After all, based on the script, the film is in Turkey, Tehran and Afghanistan. But believe me I'm familiar with the area. It's all about an Arabian desert in Morocco. Turkish people and Persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in non-Arabic language. <br /> <br /> I'm supposed to make a movie like this-documentary type - a thorough research on all these small elements is mandatory.
