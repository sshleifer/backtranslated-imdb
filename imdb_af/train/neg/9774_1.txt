Hubert Selby Jr gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and wrote the script for Aronofsky's film of it. The movie passed at every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters and the vices they destroyed. "Last exit to Brooklyn" still has the shot and the multiple characters who live sadly, but it hardly makes them the same justice as Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes looks nice anti-gay. Especially when homosexuality in the film equals death. A gay character is stoned, launched by a speed vehicle skyward and killed on the pavement. Another is crucified and even more is simply turned up. Another exaggerated piece of shock value, which could actually be compelling if it was done well, is that screens from the trade unionists literally fight the strike breakers. Who thought about Brooklyn's drama would have action series and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel, has a skill level like that of a TV director, but he is far below the cut for real movies. The movie is bunch that can't even look like a genre. The lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin just seems to look dumb in his equally slender part. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh comes as our head, a horrible hooker named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not joking). Her performance is nothing good and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. Poor use of color and composition makes it cheaper than it is, and also takes the "right" edge of the more challenging pieces. A failure.
