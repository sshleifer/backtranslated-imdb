Oh man, I know what your thinking: "With such a title I can't go wrong!" Uh yes, you can. I also loved the title, but the man I hated was the stupid kid who played "Satan's little helper". I also hated the mother and the sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated all those people! Man, it was a pity to look at it sometimes! The only reason it doesn't get 1/10 is because the low budget is being judged, it did well. But oh man, I hated those actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money on using Halloween masks for the killer, and the Jesus costume at the end was also really stupid. Oh the fear, don't watch!
