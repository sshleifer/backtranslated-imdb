No plot, crappy-acting, and useless gore .... <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear or tension, just done BOOM BANG GORE, then. Some kind of mariners are in the desert for some strange, crazy reason and they are rushed off the first movie by the mutated animals, which was good, and it had to be left there. <br /> <br /> It's just another excuse for money, and using useless violence, just like the "Saw" sequels. They don't know how useless the plot is, and the more gore they can add, people will see it. I miss good, exciting horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
