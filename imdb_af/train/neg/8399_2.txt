I'm a big Stooges fan, but the only reasoning quality this movie has is that Curley is in it. Done long before he started to drink heavily, he is his classic in this (and Larry is also not bad). Moe's character is a straight part (mostly) and this movie would be better known as "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that any of the Stooges movies were very good (in my opinion), but as a commentary said, how sad it is that this movie has real potential. The casting was good, it was well directed, filmed and edited, but the story line tried to be something serious with just a few Stooges antique and musical numbers (which I both did well). The best thing you can do for yourself during this movie if you actually believe it should be better than cutting the grass and removing the waste (subject to the debate) is to wait for Curley / Larry scenes and to sleep or get something in the kitchen to eat during the rest.
