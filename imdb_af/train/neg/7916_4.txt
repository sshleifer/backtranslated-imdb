Where to start? How about the wrong synopsis: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epic violent and romantic past, its complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program. " /> <br /> His epic violent past is evident from extremely non-violent. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so brilliant it is difficult to understand how they have any connection. We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that they as children are launching, to a fitting of war styles that they fought during their longevity, and eventually to the present where they are part of a hardcore government team of killers. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to show their relationship with brothers. Nothing complex is set for us to believe, it's authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and sudden. We are thrown into a romance so quickly that it is over before you can cut an eye. After the launch of the character, Silverfox is killed about fifteen minutes later. We have to wonder why we should care about this. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> For a core element of this poor revenge-driven story, romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed because it was just needed. <br /> <br /> Strangely, when Wolverine finds his love dead, he rots her in the bush as he goes to find Sabertooth. To be romantic that he was, out of character was still needed to serve the plot to pull out a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As far as the arms X program is concerned, we can only say that after the painfully paralyzing procedure Wolverine is underway. Eventually he comes home to a comfortable old, yet overwhelmingly lovely couple. Surprisingly, Mom and Dad Kent are not afraid to find a mere sweaty man in their shed. Is it a wonder what fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous films and comic books, the main reason Wolverines' amnesia had plagued him was partly related to the fact that he said he was cruelly angry and cold. <br /> <br /> Do you know this was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or hide them and his current more positive lifestyle continues to fight the world's villains with his teammates? <br /> <br /> As indicated in X2: X-Men United when Stryker gives some of his secrets, Wolverine is said to be disturbed if he knew about the evil works they had committed together. This movie makes the team pretty good, but they really don't do much about anything. No disturbing violence, no relentless action, they only struggle with a few natives in foreign countries for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wolverine didn't seem to be an evil man under Stryker. Instead, he continually tried to make a leash on his brother Sabertooth, which was the violent agent we all thought was Wolverine. Eventually he just leaves together. <br /> <br /> No conflict of duality here. <br /> <br /> Idiotically, remove the character conflict from good and evil. EXPLORE the story tremendously. They could also have given him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of other flaws in this movie that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the launch of one of the Lamest Deus Ex Machinas ever hit. a script. <br /> <br /> Magic memory removal of bullets. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently they're the only thing to bring down Wolverine. Yet it was apparently forgotten when agent was sent to agent to bring him with dots and bombs that would certainly not work on him. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it tries to focus on Wolverine while throwing a bunch of other mutant stuff that didn't do anything at all. Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story. Most were five to ten minutes in the film and yet you find yourself seeing more of them and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (the Blob but not the comic version) can 'miss rocket with little or no physical damage to him, but a simple head of Wolverines metal noggin is enough to challenge him? <br /> <br /> Cyclops optical beams (which instead of concussion power are now more related to lasers) can burn through buildings, but if fired directly at Sabertooth, it simply snaps into the ground without it even damaged his clothes. Adamantium ditch coat anyone? <br /> <br /> The (gravity-killing) mutant Gambit, instead of using its signature cards, is made in some crazy acrobat. In a poorly-crafted scene, Wolverine strikes him unconscious ... then it's incredibly few minutes later on a roof that runs TOWARDS Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran a few blocks away, climbed a building and then ran back to Wolverine and Saberoth in the middle of a scratching game is a mystery to be explained. Some excused it. movies weakness by claiming it is made of a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on the flash. The idea that this movie is a cartoon is faint and superficial because the fact is wrong. <br /> <br /> The cartoon source material, the true origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. . It doesn't bother about its past, and doesn't treat the reader like CGI junkies. This is a well-made story and although it has been restored and revised in the past, WEAPON X started from Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie must be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Anyone has that magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
