Elizabeth Taylor couldn't act at all and she was just her usual annoying, undisputed self in this movie. It was before she got so fat, but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict, but clearly a more series actor like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. The actors were too young and lightweight and none of them were convincing because of the poor makeup. Hudson looks ridiculous just to be knocked out and Dean and Carroll Baker were of course the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
