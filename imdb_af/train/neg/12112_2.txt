I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie. I couldn't even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies and strange movies, but this one bored me to death. Poorly made and bad acting spoiled it to be inquisitive. You have to wonder what these people think when they spend money to produce this movie. I wonder what I think at the end. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. How did they release it? Was there an audience who likes this kind of movie? There must be because you can find it almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> Earn to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, it's for you.
