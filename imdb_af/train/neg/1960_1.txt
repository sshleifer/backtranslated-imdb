I tried three times to finish this movie, but it's terribly god. Case in point: mother and daughter ride to bed and breakfast, mom stop for gas, crazy gas station, weirdos love her hubby whose B&B is trying to rape her. She escapes, heads to the B&B and instead of the male ballistic and she wants to call the police, the story goes on with lukewarm behavior on both parts. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other action logic shortages are abundant. The acting is also lukewarm, and the neighbor's neighbor is alerted in a very chilly, heavily activated moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense gore / death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interaction between characters. </ br /> <br /> Less focus on gore, more focus on mood and story would be appreciated.
