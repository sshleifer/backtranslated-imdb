I can't believe this movie is allowed. These people have to be drug and beat with blunt objects. They must be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It's nothing but footage of the first movie. Whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense. It's like a kind of drug hallucination. Just like with a mirror naked therapy. Also, regardless of the moron laughing together, this thorn didn't even bother the first movie, as they called Suzanna Love's character Natalie, when it was Lacey. I felt like shouting it on the screen: "It's nice, it's nice !!!!". I give it a -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
