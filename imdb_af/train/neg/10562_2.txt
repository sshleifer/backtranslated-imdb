This very low budget comedy barber trunk only succeeds in a low budget. Dialogue is dumbfoundingly stupid, chasing scenes are actually boring and most of the screen money seems to have been saved for a series of accidents and explosions in a parking lot during the last five minutes of the movie. Early in that scene it is sure to ruin and spit on the head's villain of the movie - no prop is here without a purpose. The whole film is depressed, reminiscent of those who occasionally came from Rodger Corman's studio when he first gave director a few bucks and a camera - but without the discipline that Corman would impose.
