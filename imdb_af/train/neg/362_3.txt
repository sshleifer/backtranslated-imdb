Not to be confused with the Madonna movie "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing", is a stupid, campy, out-of-the-wall comedy about a man who desires a magazine called The Next Big Thing to begin reviewing a variety of emerging artists. This low budget indie "Chuck and Buck" looks like a masterpiece. Filled with common action, poor sets and costumes, etc., "... Thing" earned some horrible reviews and so far only nominated for one fringe award. Pass on this one.
