What had the idea of ​​seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would satisfy Charlotte Bronte's brilliance of the original classic story. I was very disappointed to find that this movie, which was apparently written or filmed, did not have the features that made the original novel so powerful. Lots of spectacular back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, it seemed like it was off the screen or left on the cutter floor. Also, Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through her unrest and triumph over everything, is missing. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie does not seem to conquer much, including one of the biggest parts of the story when Jane left Thornfield and Mr. Rochester run away. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame to beg for bread, the threat to freeze in the cold, to get away from a man she loved was, in my opinion, offensive parts of the story that were simple was omitted from this movie. The title character was dry and uninspired. The story was unattractive and for those who didn't read the book, I couldn't imagine that this story would be the least interesting. The script and Direction did little or no credit to the classic story.
