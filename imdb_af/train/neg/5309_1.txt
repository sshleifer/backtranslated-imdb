I saw the movie on the cable one night and couldn't believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so disturbing that it wasn't even entertaining. Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music that is constantly being played by the movie, the terribly special effects (when shooting with a laser gun, they are neon green and immediately disintegrate) and the disgusting play. The acting is, in fact, what I feel, the show steal. I didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie, and I hope I should never see one of them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it; I can't suggest a video store that carries this garbage) just so you can learn to appreciate quality movies after seeing this garbage.
