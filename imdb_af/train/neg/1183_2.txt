These and Immoral Tales both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is sex, and these two movies are warning stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it's not done very well - some of the acting is actually bad (like the "American" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop is anxious that the marriage is interested (if it seems to have been the other way around) and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret doesn't make sense. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man is presented as a sign of her family's perversion or love for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is a "sexy animal", if you wish, living in the bush, could have been the basis for a perverse but fun story, but rather used as a basis for a terrible sex-negative, morality game.
