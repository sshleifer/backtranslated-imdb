Since Crouching's Tiger Hidden Dragon came, much has been said about a revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Don't believe it. The people who now make movies in HK give new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name sign, here, but he spends most of the movie just idiot grinning and turning a coin. He hit the coin over and over and over and over. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a police spokesman chasing the cute little boy. But again: who knows why? There is a pretty actress in the female head who runs a kind of company and she has to pay a ransom or something, but she looks mostly like being at a spa or shopping center rather than a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
