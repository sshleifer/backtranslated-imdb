Two years ago at Sundance, I loved Josh Kornbluth's ruling debut Haikunnel. So I look forward to his brother (and regular colleague) Jacob, the best thief in the world. It's a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower class area of ​​New York. The movie is not without its spicy moments. But sometimes it is as if Kornbluth is working too hard to put the obvious: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtly and more importantly, our understanding is that, despite all this somewhat horrendous cultural underpinning and the anti-social behavior they can cultivate, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity. We can regain their language and their living conditions, but we cannot discount their intention. And, in fact, their struggle to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can hardly appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this environment, and his compassion for the people is constantly clear. <br /> <br /> It all said, the best thief in the world suffers from very painful defects (including the title). The characters are not very credible. The writing is uneven. And the plot line is barely observable. And for many of the most disturbing, Kornbluth uses two young black boys who mimic bendsta rap between screens. For each of its own: But while not questioning the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see 5-year-olds and talk about sex with a range of women. It is unnecessarily shocking value and is a forced piece of borrowed interest.
