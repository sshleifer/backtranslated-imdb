I expected the release of the movie as much as any fan of the Broadway game. I waited months for reviews on the award-winning shows. I mean by the strength of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie can't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed with the final product. Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque show just saves the movie when it hits its hits. Multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's performance force you to pay attention to the screen every time. Her performance of "And I Tell You" was the only time I felt the hype was deserving. You cried while she did not beg her a good man to leave her in the group and in his life. As many reviewers have said, she steals the film from the more experienced actors and earns all the awards she receives for this show. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a good voice and comic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, crossed their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this movie seemed to have predicted his extraordinary "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles was an elaborate photo shoot or video tapering that set her way through the movie. Her performance wasn't strong enough to worry you at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was too hip, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "sad" solo for Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
