To have the laws over the weekend? Then it is the movie to speed up their departure, if it will not cause a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief of constant scrutiny. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposedly aboard a luxury ship, which is more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average collar and a throw thrown from the depths of the well-known D list. An interesting piece of additional entertainment plays "Spot the Villain" as passengers join the ship. You won't be wrong !! With a screenplay that doubles faster than brick sinking, stone-dense pieces and large amounts of raspberry jam like blood, this film tries to cover the genres of thriller, action movie and gore fest while at the same time failing to fulfill any of them. <Br /> <br /> A must watch movie, than just laughing at how bad it is.
