What a horrible movie. I love monster flashes, but I couldn't even see half of the terrible actors, characters and turbulent special effects. There's nothing about this movie. The characters come from either an endless supply of suicide bombers or otherwise they are turbulent, uninspiring socks. The plot is formulating, cutting and pasting, standard science-run-amok drift. Even the CGI is terrible. You know it's bad when you don't even rely on the movie to give good sweets. No surprises here, just the same old guy. It's really one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman has to be hung from a light pole so children can use him as a pinata.
