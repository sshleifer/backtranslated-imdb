It's a bad movie. None of the funny bad. It's a bad bad one. It was actually painful to watch. The direction was terrible, with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow shades used throughout the film, making the characters sick. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick, and I can't believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed for this criminal cellulite waste. The writing was terrible and the acting was like a fingernail over a plate. If you haven't seen it, don't do it. You miss nothing and will only waste two hours of your life. I've seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them. This one is just a waste of time.
