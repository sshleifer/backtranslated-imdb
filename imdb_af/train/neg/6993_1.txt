What a terrible movie. I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this repetition. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki played Pfifer in this movie? Mehki Pfifer is big in E.R and Ving Rhames probably didn't know what he did. I feel terrible for them. The music background I have to say doesn't fit with ALLLLL with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives to create a good and balanced movie. I hope that in the future no director was as horrible as this, ever to disturb such a great classic movie. This film should not be made in the first place. An advice to everyone who saw it, please tell me I'm right because I might not be the only viewer who didn't enjoy it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
