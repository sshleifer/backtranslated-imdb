This is a baffling movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is affected by a set of men and women that can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits. <br /> <br /> Greenaway recognizes his inspiration for Fellini's film "8 1/2", but while Fellini is a world cinema titan, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> He has nothing of the maestro's light touch or his ability to convey feelings and emotions. with a clarity of clarity. <br /> <br /> He is pretentious, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each one, as if the viewer were to be led into the movie, except that the written notifications only keep on screen for a few seconds, not long enough to read through the audience, with the result that they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two can be described as viewers, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. That res ooze with ordinariness. Both the women and the men withdraw themselves from the harsh reality relief in the dull shades of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Greenaway wants the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. The women themselves are depressed because they provide their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are lacking in a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the movie. There are indeed many scenes that are very unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of a blood-related relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental, played by John Standing and Matthew Delamere respectively. The indifference of both men that Giaconda carries their child is actually conceived twice, the first fetus is broken down and the second time she is selected for a destination chosen by the men from a flight book. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs, (the half-woman in the title). The beestiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortense. Father and son share women among them. Women enjoy being sexually beaten. The father sleeps with the body of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> None of these scenes are shown sexually but merely shown. <br /> <br /> The toned decline of women is such that there is no wonder the film was first placed in Cannes. What is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film are committed to defending it, which again shows that there is no restriction on women's naivety and that women will deceive themselves into exploiting men. <br /> <br /> Greenaway's direct style is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over substance, a representation of Film as art, accompanied by the rejection of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to reach the sublimity of surrealism, but only manages to display the banality of human relationships.
