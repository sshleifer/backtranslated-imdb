It could be one of the worse movies I've ever seen. I don't see how it can ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? It's more like a clumsy drama. The terrifying music is excellent, but as there were no terrifying situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for daily activities, such as stepping down a dump or staircase. the movie had so much potential. They had beautiful cinematography (sp?) And interesting characters, but it was as if the authors assumed that you already knew them. they would have their own activities without explanation or even an indication of what they meant. It's just one of those movies that says it's about one thing and it's something completely different.
