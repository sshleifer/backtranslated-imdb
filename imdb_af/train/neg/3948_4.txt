It's not the video, but just because it came out in 1994 when they were probably tired of the whole thing in Britain. That's 75% a rehash from The Boogeyman, and would be banned for the same reason - whatever. <br /> <br /> I was initially confused because I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been different. Lacey, but she was someone's trouble with psychological visions of an archmaster similar to the one in the first movie. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After seeing a murder in a bathroom and seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a parapsychology student who looks very much like the man On the cheap romance novels and butter -Advertising, going to the house, and sure enough this is the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happened just as she described. Of course, we do not have an idea who this boyfriend is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then the movie has been moved to a revival of The Boogeyman story with some extra material we didn't see in the original. In particular, the boogyman is shown differently from the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes have been cut, but 90% of them are there. Why is this movie reliving? Did they find the material in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We'll never know, and despite the psychologist Annie tells, she's healed, we all know the boeyman will never die.
