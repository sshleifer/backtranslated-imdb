I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those with strangers. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre other than horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and I even love bad people because almost no movie ever fails to entertain or entertain at a level. Except for "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." <br /> <br /> When I showed a "Cowgirls", I joined an audience of about 10. Less than halfway I stayed alone. Soon I could even endure the disturbing debris that unfolds before my eyes, and I also left. To this day, Cowgirls remains the only movie I've ever run. <br /> <br /> I don't quite know how to describe this incoherent, turbulent, frivolous, meaningless movie, or how to properly convey that lack of redeeming value. Suffice it to say that it ranks as one of the worst big movies of all time, striking and inexcusable at every level. It tries to be clever, but its view of feminism looks hopelessly anachronistic. It is trying to be funny, but its humor is rough and unrelenting. It is one of the few films that successfully defuse its own ethos by depicting protagonists in such a way that they are rebelling against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, see "Waterworld", "Ishtar," anything other than that. Except for the new "Alexander." If you choose between this and this, read a book instead.
