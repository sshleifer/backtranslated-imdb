I hoped this movie was generously entertaining, like other types of its genre. However, it was lame and I didn't laugh a lot. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could be funny, maybe if the writing was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just don't see this one. The direction is dark, but for what it is, directing is not so important. I think his biggest drawback is that it's just not very funny. See something else, don't waste your time.
