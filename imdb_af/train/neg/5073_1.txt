The teasers for Tree of Palme try to give it away as a kind of allegory for a real-life fairy tale, and start the animation immediately. I had to know what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole movie's problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero looking for himself, the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once cared for. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the movie, Palme is poorly defined. You don't like the characters, although Shatta got some daredevil girls. It seems as if the writer is more interested in combating all the drama and complexity he could have in this movie than examining his characters' motivation and personalities. <br /> <br /> New, useless story lines have been introduced in the past fifteen. minutes of the movie. The author had to streamline his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would be better suited to a TV series or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie I simply couldn't endure the mere lack of quality and started laughing to see how the characters, relationships, and entire composition were confronted. I touched my companion and he also started cracking, just like a young man behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply couldn't use the terrible quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the sumptuous backgrounds and charming character. designs. The animation almost leads you; If you don't care about the characters, tell them how to feel.
