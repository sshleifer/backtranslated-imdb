Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. These three lines summarize this crappy little movie that can only attract the idiot children and their parents to the theater. and its ... # 1 movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese woman falling asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It is grotesque and terrible. When green eggs and ham come out, I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am and that means you run away. (I hope they don't waste the classic book.) Don't waste time and money by seeing it.
