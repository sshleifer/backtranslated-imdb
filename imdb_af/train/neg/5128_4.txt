This early B entry in the patriotic category has beaten a beautiful young Gene Tierney on the advertisements and posters, but you have to wait a long time before you see her in a Hollywood camel train. Previously, we founded George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely meet, but must face attack. I saw Sanders as so many nice pillows that it was fun to see a rare good old twist. However, Bruce Cabot's appearance is a mystery to me - he is basically and unseen in comparison, but I have always felt like he just got up, smiling, from underneath a car, greasy and a sixth grade education. Some people like them the same way, as does Gene's gypsy queen character. It's an action adventure filler, and just as we were warned that guns are invading, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their country, there is a final rally in which we are a main character for everything. This feature requires nothing more than your worst attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who made everything that matched it better. It was almost more interesting to identify Dorothy Dandridge's major supporting role and surprise appearance in one of her first roles. A two or two and a half stars out of five. MDM
