<br /> <br /> As soon as I ignored the disabilities, it was a pretty decent horror / monster movie. So, I will first give the good points: - The dragon was pretty convincing, especially because she was looking through the tunnels to find lunch (hint: she likes people). - The action wasn't quite stopping, and after a poor start I absorbed a bit in the storyline. - sorry to say, I loved the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now for the unquestionable things ** maybe a few spoilers **: - If you were looking for a fire-breathing dragon in 1100, would you lift the cave with a dish of fire under your arm? Duh. - a female character with an all-American name, blonde hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Huh? - A chief scientist whose Slavic accent can cut you with a knife, and is supposedly born in Chicago, raised in the US? - A military helicopter pilot doing his own repairs, flying a giant transport copter with no other crew, and is a knowledgeable marker and battle soldier to begin? OK. Uh huh. I won't even mention that he gives 3 different ring marks in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> It's even better than some of the Japanese 60s monster movie, but not much. If we are happy, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, but of course, the end is wide open. Or, maybe they will hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, I gave this flick a 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
