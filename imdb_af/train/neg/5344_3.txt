You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (except the songs), and their driver, Simon Fuller (also this group's manager) made the same mistake to play S Club (one of my favorite bands) in their own movie make. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically ask their boss for a break, they continue, and while they are watching themselves on TV! Three of them swapped, and vice versa, half discovered that they were clones made by a greedy scientist and the other half found themselves in trouble. Also the lead role of Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This movie can have more of a plot than Spice Girls' movie, but besides the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream Come True", this is no reason to not see. this movie. Not too long after the group split. Sufficient!
