Wow, this movie was just bloody fear. So bad in the fact that even if I didn't pay to see it, I still wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> The film is about nothing understandable. This is a mish-mash of sci-fi cliches that were better done by many more skilled filmmakers. The performances, especially by the lead, were over in a less intense Ed Wood way. Speaking of Ed Wood, he will be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too quiet with no irony or sense of humor. In addition, it doesn't make sense, not the plot either. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are okay, but not enough to go "oh wow, it's cool" and they just seem to be thrown in to be "cool" rather than a good plot device to be. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mishmash of things that really never put a kind of mood. Again, it seemed as if the director was just throwing songs into the movie, trying to be "cool". <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my final point. Perhaps if the director was actually more concerned about plot, story and dialogue instead of being "cool," he wouldn't have made such a brave click of a short movie. <br /> <br />
