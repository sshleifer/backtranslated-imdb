If the crew behind the "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, there are councilors: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twist Ending" type movie, it's not a good idea to get close-ups of EVERY DEAD IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. It tends to spoil the twists, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you've produced it on a screen and to be honest, you've worked miracles with your budget, but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you're going to make a part of your movie in the past, just do it if you have the props and costumes of the time. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist ends are supposed to be a surprise. Certainly, we don't want twists that don't make sense, but the "revelation" sign when you introduce a character? This is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the guys to try, but in all honesty, I'd rather have them ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie finishers.
