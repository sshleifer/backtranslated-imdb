Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can change and be distorted by those who are ignorant or ruled by an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately, this movie does not represent either. What we have shown is a propaganda piece with lots of fingers that blow and show. The animation and direction were good considering the budget and the period, but the essence of George Orwell's novel is much lacking. <br /> <br /> If you want to be one of those who wants to see how not to be a novel or just interested to see an adaptation of this brilliant novel. I just found this to be somewhat mediocre. Only one man's opinion. <br /> <br /> The remake is a notch below, but not much.
