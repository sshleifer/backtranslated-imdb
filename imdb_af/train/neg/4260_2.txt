Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The first hour I waited patiently for the movie to take off. It was terribly boring, and mostly consisted of people randomly driving around the hills without a clear direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Of course white. He wasn't even close to Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Pointless battle order and lame dialogue. It was an hour and forty-five minutes, and by the end I tried to eat my own face. I watched it because people in the video store where I work always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It goes as follows: ahem. "NO GOOD GOD NO! THIS IS GUARANTEED! DON'T DO IT FOR YOURSELF! I will recommend another movie, maybe one that is entertaining."
