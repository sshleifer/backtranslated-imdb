Of the ten actors depicted by Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe was the most pleasant, but in this screenplay, the audience is far away from the well-known detective. Finally, when jockey Douglas Walton stares blankly into space, it is hypnotized, of course, and says something like, "I have to drive and be killed." I felt stupid that no one picked it up after being killed. Police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After hated horse owner, Gene Lockhart is shot dead, Frieda Inescort doing the same thing, saying she's going to be killed and then killing a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouted, "I got it," as if it were a revelation. The guilty party was, however, cleverly hidden and there was considerable tension generated when the party hypnotized Lowe to let him jump from a roof.
