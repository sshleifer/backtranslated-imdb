1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you can't believe, just wasted 2 hours of your life, as you see the credit. I honestly think I can make a better Vampire movie .... and I don't know anything. The only thing that doesn't just suck (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee. His character is at least a little cool, has a little secret and kicks a little.
