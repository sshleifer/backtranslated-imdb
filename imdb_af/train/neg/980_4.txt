My first full Heston movie. The movie all finished with the end. A "Sci Fi Thriller". The camp factor. Everything that went into this movie was injected into my head when I rented it, and the morning I watched, it was the perfect movie to watch the mood I was. (Don't want to move in blankets). And although I tried to understand what had happened to lead to the end that will be ruined forever by culture, it really didn't fix it. Everything was all over the place, relationships had no backbone, the end had no head start. Everything was just as freakish as there and the viewer has no choice but to be partially obscured by the end it comes to. Because even though we all know it's people, it's quick answers to why people are making a serious effort to enjoy the movie for anything other than the sotiness that is thrown out of the window.
