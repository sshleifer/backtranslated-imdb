Considering the risk of showing the same gender relationships before the late 1980s, Personal Best could have done better to play the same gender relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of Cahill's life. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this movie have cast the same relationship between two pretty attractive women to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds to expose the crossroads of several women, who jump back over a high jump pole. This random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as if it had just been done to interest the audience in this thin film. I suppose the producers were trying to counter the boring plot and the even more boring movie setting (the Oregon Oregon Track and Field competition). <br /> <br /> This review may look hard, but it's the truth. The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway's body and the same gender relationship destroyed any credit I would have given to this movie. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
