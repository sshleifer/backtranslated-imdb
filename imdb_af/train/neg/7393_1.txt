I'm a great Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I'm probably weighing as much as he does although I don't have the street credit to sport the frizzy-mullet ponytail. After my own prejudice and love for America's favorite corporative stage and heroine, it's hard to declare it as its worst movie ever. I'm not sure he can make a movie worse than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the big problem with this movie seems to be after the production. It is painfully clear that this movie is supposed to have a different storyline. This leads to malignant voice calls in which Steve's voice does not nearly synchronize with that of the confronted voice. The editing is piss-track and overall it's getting bad, getting worse, and by the end you'll wish you had looked at the Da Vinci code again. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After that I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends are still laughing at me listening to his CDs. Is it time to first look at the Van Damme DVD-friendly logbook? If you are requested to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs out and rinse them in the toilet. A life of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
