Please do not look at it for the love of God. Now say I know what you think, it can't be that bad, can it? If everyone says it's as bad as they say, I have to see it! Don't do it! It will be like a terrible accident with small babies and a petrol tank! You will be afraid of life ... the image will never leave you! I can only see half an hour before I get pregnant. The acting is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you run the risk of jerking your eyes and renting this movie ... don't say I didn't warn you! The cover and storyline is a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was wonderful! This movie should be the same. NO !! Writing = crap directing = rubbish acting = there was no acting. Still not convinced? Then your soul will be tormented forever !!!
