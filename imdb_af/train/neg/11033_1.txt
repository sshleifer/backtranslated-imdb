The latest rumors are that Vh1 is making calls for the love of New York 3 mid-2008. So does that mean Budah or Tailor who dumped New York, or does it mean New York plunged the winner? <br /> <br /> I know Flavor of Love comes to the 3rd season, so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and an I love New York 3 ..... there will ever be a real winner be ??? <br /> <br /> I also heard a few rumors that Chance will be brought back for New York's 3rd season !! I also heard rumors that New York will be specially on Flavor of Love 3. Hopefully it wasn't too much of a fairy tale to end the love of New York 2. I'm just saying the latest rumors.
