I had a fascination with the cartoon again in college when it was made. It had many the charm of "Get Smart". While it did have its faults, it was quite nice. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was very interested in the movie version. That was before I saw it. After I wish it had never been made. <br /> <br /> Apart from being wasted everywhere (who was on Broderick, was even close to the role?) It just didn't make the grade. <br /> <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked about the movie; see a live action version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and treatment that made it funny or atmospheric or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy cartoon with a very light attitude. It was fine. The movie became dark and caught him too seriously. If it had a serious plot or got mad to make it look like a "cartoon on film" it could have been nice. <br /> <br /> As it exists, it doesn't earn part of the "Gadget Legacy".
