RUN ... doesn't run away from this movie !!!!! Targeting the very young children, this movie will lead you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar, this movie just dropped it. It's slow and the monster battles are good, but rarely seen. This movie wore me dry in the boot. Just a very poor offer to a phenomenal 90's series. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons. The 90's Gamera fans will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child trying to kill his mother's death and fearing that he lost baby Gamera after he knew his father had the mature Gamera died. <br /> <br /> 9. You might see the adult Gamera a minute at the start of the movie. He gets his butt kicked by some Gyaos and self-destructions ??? He looks old and funny. Plus he looks nothing like any camera you've ever seen. His suit looks cheap and chased. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the movie looks like a Pok√©mon. Big eye and cute ... it will remind you of Godzilla's baby Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the pass of a NASCAR race during a 3-hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and no one was happy with how slow this movie was moving. I saw a SUV full of fat people moving on a mountain road moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie has very little kaiju time on the screen. Final wars had much more, actually and better fights, though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the title role. The friend of all children's theme and poor writing murdered the original Gamera series in the 1970s and history repeats itself in the 2000s. The most successful Gamer movies left the Sesame Street feeling and went to a dark spot. Why go back to a failed formula? It was a new trilogy and poor ticket sales have killed any hope for this story to continue (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost its iconic roar. He now sounds like an elephant with a streaky throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can produce a new Olympic event. Imagine a relay race that many young children have to get in the way. You need to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yes, right, they send their kids to a kayak camp zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was the apple-sized baby Gamera flying. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is just what adult Kaiju fans expect to expect. The director was involved with Power Rangers and it shows. It comes down like a cross between ET, Altyd: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos if you already know 3 references. <br /> <br /> Rent at best or watch once you buy it to complete the DVD series.
