Aside from the action by Meryl Streep, who is always up to date, I want to avoid this movie because it has a dated "Movie of the Week" quality about it. But it's worth checking out the different captions: How a couple investigates the media, and how the different are dealt with. <br /> <br /> In the course of the movie, the problem is the credibility of the other. Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come with an air of "strangeness" about them. The couple involved are religious (different from most cultures) and Adventists (otherwise). So their lifestyle and attitude is suspicious to start with. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we are faced with questions of strangeness. The true story then is how society (and the world) treat the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs than we do and how we treat what they say as suspects. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the phrase: A Dingo took my baby! "without laughing and there are humorous posts, unfortunately, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie, it was discovered (as found in web searches) that much larger children are stalked by dingos. Research by experts in dingos has shown that it was not only possible, but most likely the baby was taken by dingos (perhaps a few), pulled out of the clothes and eaten without trace within moments. <br /> <br /> Still, being left behind is the question why people defended dingos when they were found to threaten children, rather than kill the dingo to save the children, why a woman says influence (expression) is so cold, it is assumed that he is guilty. on and on. <br /> <br /> Ask questions, with or without the movie.
