I really have no idea why some people find the Power Rangers television program even remotely. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in it also look foolish at the same time. There is absolutely something in the distance that is interesting about the power rangers. It's just a higher priced television commercial design to sell extremely harsh plastic garbage to the unsuspecting kids around the world. From the notes I can see that it has been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this performance at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
