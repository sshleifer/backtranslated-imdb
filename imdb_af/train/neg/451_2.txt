I don't care how many nominations this junk got for the best this and it got, this movie bumped. I didn't know if the set should turn off or bring a lawsuit with O.J. 's lawyer for unlawful damage to my mental health. I'm rarely bored; To mention this misunderstanding is a slap in the face of every movie on the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was oninspired, the "drama" was emotional. I'm grateful that I didn't have to pay for this unfulfilled experience.
