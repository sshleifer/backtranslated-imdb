I can't understand why so many people praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most boring titles I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen all the season 1 episodes and saw the season 2 episode 1. I can't take this show anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the proper induction in criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In season 1, there was a scene that agent Cooper threw stones at a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He just wants to identify killer by doing this "joke" while calling the supernatural ability of the Tibet dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 started with a "funny" scene that a stupid old man served to Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper was lying on the floor. (He already has the gunshots in his stomach.) This old man does nothing but give stupid comments. This is all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec ... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I'll read some comics rather than see this show more.
