Well, the big money machine did it again! Disney's very keen use of morons like me who feels we should own every video (good or bad) with the Disney moniker. Why is it that I continue to watch these "successors" who look like Don Bluth on a bad day like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three story lines (already a poor choice!) Shouldn't one of the most engaging Disney creations at least make a linear story? Of these, just one last comes near the quality of animation and storytelling I would expect. The music is horrible and modern (it means it will be dated in 2 years) and does not add anything to the story. Why should everything be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Give, I can't wait for a sequel to Sleep Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you listen, remember we're not all indifferent kids here. How about a leg or two for the fans long enough to know the difference between craft and crap?
