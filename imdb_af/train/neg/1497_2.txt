Understand I watch the movie I saw. I realize almost all the nudity and gore have been cut from this movie, and thus completely nuts it. When I attached names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew I wasn't going to get a horror class, but at least I expected gay boobies and bloodshed. But no, it must be the most generous modern horror movie, I mean it's easy to say there is much more to some scenes, but they suddenly cut off or the scene just ends right as it starts. How to screw cannibals and pornstars? I mean it's a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director slept with a CEO's wife or something, because it's literally incredible how many of them were cut. I was excited about it a few years back in Fangoria, it looked like a fun movie, but unfortunately the real movie was locked somewhere in a safe, and we have to endure this bit of Evil Race. Hopefully one unlucky track will one day be released, because I think there is a good movie in this mess, but so far you get the best of a twelve pack of Bud, as it's the only way to make it through the movie.
