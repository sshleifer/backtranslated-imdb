The original movie (dated 19 ??) did not show a "monster", it just suggested scary "stuff". <br /> <br /> However, this version shows every aspect of a sickly ghost ", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The" mystery ", as presented in the original movie, was the worst part : One simply did not know what caused the strange things that happened, pointing the face of the "old man", this gentleman completely disappeared, even worse: the special effects (crying wooden children's faces) It's ridiculous, it's a stupid remake, which is of course spectacular to be as frightening as the original
