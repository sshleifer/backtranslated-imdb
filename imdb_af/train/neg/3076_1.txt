This movie should not be seen unless you try to kill yourself. I think this movie can actually cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the cunning non-hero Kevin, Amy, his rogue, wicked conservative friend, Kyle, a jerk in red pants who has a phone call, Daphne, a nasty, horny girl who is supposed to be "cool" and has no sense of how to dress, and her renowned boyfriend Nick, an army site who can make an innuendo out of anything. No, I'm not a pervert, it's really how the movie goes. The movie itself is an overarching rip-off of 1986's Gremlins, but you'll never find a trail of Gizmo. No, this Hobgoblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it. Eventually they come to a strip club, where Amy's greatest dream is revealed. She wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this movie through MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, I made a laugh out of this movie wreck and it still blew me from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I no longer give you a plot because it gives me this great urge to drive an elevator through my brain. In addition, there is no such thing as a plot. They should place a surgeon's general warning on this movie.
