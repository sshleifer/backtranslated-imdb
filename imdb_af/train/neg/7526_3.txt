This is a high-grade cheese cost of B-movie kung fu flicks. Bruce "Wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let's show quick cuts of Bruce and close-ups of his eyes and shrinking in the right angle during the winter, it looks like Bruce. You will get rid of how the film splitting is not very good, but some cool-out scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by an arrow while hanging from a helicopter. Of course they think Bruce Li can excuse Bruce for trying, although his character is supposed to be Bruce's brother (for some reason still Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very weak). See Bruce go one-on-one with the cowardly lion. The prop section is stopped by Kay-Bee, which you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with hitting a disabled man in a savage way. By the end, the director decided to give a flash back to a scene shown just 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only one cell organisms with attention deficit disorder can fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
