I was really disappointed with this movie. It started out really well, and built up a good atmosphere and tension, but when it finally got lost to reveal the "monster" ... it was just a few psychos with skin problems ...... again. Whoop-de-do. Another nutjob movie ... as we don't have enough of them. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the "creep" is really disturbing to look at and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes very beautiful, but I'm sick of renting such a movie Just to discover that the monster is human, even if it's a twisted, demented, freakish. Seeing all the rocks early, I was hoping for some freaky rat-monster hybrid thing. It was a little cut off when the creep was revealed. <br /> <br /> Moreover, some of the things in this movie don't make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why does the Creep kill the security guard? What is the point, apart from a large honey note saying, "Hi, I'm a PSYCHO and I'm living here!"? It's stupid, and it seems like it's happening to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. <br /> <br /> What helped him eat there? I have the impression that he was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening in that tunnel section let him go ... so he has messed up rats that time and if so why do they hang so much around him? Why is he so hard to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not exactly at peak performance ... but seems to persist despite injuries equivalent to those who destroy the non-psychic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD comment says we're meant to empathize with Creep, but I just find it ominous. It's an effective enough movie, but it has wasted so much time making it sick.
