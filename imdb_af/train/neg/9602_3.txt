Daniella has a few issues to brew under her attractive exterior. She starts losing her head if she finds out about a distant relative (who she looks like) who is burned because she is a werewolf. She goes a little cruel when she hits horses horny men and smears their throat. She eventually finds a man who helps contain her inner animal, but when others destroy their happiness, she withdraws her violent and hairy revenge. <br /> <br /> "Werewolf Woman" is not a very good movie, but it is a good crowd movie. A fun time can be through the bad acting / dubbing / translation and the habit of stocking the production. But on its own it moves slowly but has enough nudity to keep you awake.
