A "friend", clearly without any taste or class, suggested I look at Ron Atkins' work. If it's representative of his oeuvre, I never want to see him anything else. It is amateurish, self-sufficient, criminal and self-supporting junk. The "whore baker" of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who kills a bunch of hookers. There is some nudity and some erections, but no single element can possibly save it from the hangman's nose. The lighting is terrible, the dialogue is puerile and mostly shouting, and the direction is clueless. I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those featured. He spoke as if something was important about his work, but after seeing this, I saw nothing of any imports whatsoever. There is also no style, and the terrible video effects (such as sonication) only improve amateurishness. Not so bad, it's fun. Avoid.
