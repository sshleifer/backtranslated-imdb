I read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I am a great Francophile and art film lover, but I believe this is another case in which critics make something "arty" or "intellectual" in something that is not. I will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perversion I never wanted to see. Of course, the piano teacher has great psychological problems, but I really didn't want to see them being shown graphically. The film is essentially disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a dream, I was averted by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it wasn't anywhere near the kind of dislike and repulsion I felt during this movie.
