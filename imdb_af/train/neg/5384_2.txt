All Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their movie through a mains distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the hype of the movie does not justify the content in the movie. The story is absent and can easily be short. The acting is poor, but the animation and music is pretty good. Otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! However, if you have the chance to watch the movie for free, do it. Then you don't have to waste money. Still, the filmmakers do a good job of printing their story and creating cliff hangers with their self-reliant mini-series. Otherwise, they are one wonders that never had a hit.
