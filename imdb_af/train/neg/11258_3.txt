I said it in other reviews, without a story, you can listen to all the smoke and mirrors you want, but no one will give a damn. <br /> <br /> The director has a good eye for 30's art deco (which I love) and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and so can indeed make the wave of the future in movies. However, it is clear that the director is so interested in the digital version of his movie. He forgot to make many scenes that helped this surprisingly dilute plot tremendously. (SPOILER) To cry out loud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK they have one, but he has been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point of having a villain. As far as the action is concerned, let's see Sky Captain (Law) shooting off ONE robot, two or three of the flight wing planes (ahead of Dex (Ribisi), saying he must stop shooting them !!!), and some robots but usually spends his time watching and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is completely wasted in this movie (the reviewer commenting on hair and the law's lack of chemistry is so right) and I for one got a little sick of repeated shots of the top of her camera, she shows TWO SHOTS ONLY, which she later falls into the movie, one uncomfortable, one pretty funny, although I've seen it for 70 years. No one except Law and Paltrow has any significant time on the screen, and that's the movie's real mistake. A listener does not identify with robots, they need a hero to root, and a visible, despicable villain who hates. Without it, plus a good interesting story, all the CG in the world won't help.
