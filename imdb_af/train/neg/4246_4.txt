Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her dedicated son (Ron Silver) to introduce the once-off film star Greta Garbo and suggest the two before Estelle looks for the good. Perhaps 'Bancroft Talks' was entitled, as the actress attacked this uncertain comic / dramatic / sentimental material for his expensive. The hot or cold director Sidney Lumet cannot get a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's constant overheating is not cut back by the filmmaker. He holds her right on the front: cute, teary-eyed and ranting. Estelle becomes a mourning on this scenario (not that the thinly-trapped plot goes much further). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming. * 1/2 of ****
