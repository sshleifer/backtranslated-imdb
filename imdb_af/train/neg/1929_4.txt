Some praised -Atlantis: -The Lost Empire- as a Disney adult adventure. I don't think so - at least for adults to think about. <br /> <br /> This script sets off as a live action movie that hit someone like the kind of crap you can't sell to adults. The "cracking staff" of many older adventure movies have been well done before, (think The Dirty Dozen), but Atlantis represents one of the worse movies in the motif. The characters are weak. Even the backdrop that makes every member look proud looks uncomfortable. An MD / Medicine man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted boys, if we haven't seen it before, we've seen with mix-and-match quirks before. The story of how one companion Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci) has completely unconvincing from flower shops to demolitions. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic spoken by Michael J. Fox, has some depth to him. Milo's quest for Atlantis continues with his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo sitting on a knee gently on his knee, as his grandfather puts his pith helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were thin, the best part about -Atlantis was the voice talent. Commandant Rourke lost nothing pronounced by James Garner. Although Rourke is a pretty military type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into characters through his delivery. Garner's voice performance is the highest point. I'm sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy's dying king is nothing more than compulsory. In addition, Don Novello, as the demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also remarkable for one or two things done, funny lines - but I've always kept Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Well done was the computer animation. The background animation, that is. The character animation does nothing if it doesn't already make flat characters, even flatter. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is little to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure about it. Any useful plot can be made in something new with the correct treatment. Shakespeare often started from a well-known story and plot and was only known for adding a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And of course, Atlantis doesn't. <br /> <br /> I can't enter all the logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot's bridges snap like a rope and the end doesn't make sense. To add to that, the script and animation are tasted with annoying messiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been incorrectly translated and the "Coast of Ireland" must be the "Coast of Iceland" read, we are beginning to experience problems. The authors of the script should know the British tasks for Eire or Eireann as Ireland, and ignore the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know about the Vikings conspiracy to name the greener island of Iceland and the island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making the problem of a misunderstood letter, the authors doomed themselves to require a runic version of English and a post-Roman date. Since then, Atlantis has been sinking into its submarine cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had, the subscription made much less reliable. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, or it won't know anything about the cave or the crystal. lies "in the king's eye". It should have been written after the sinking, but without the technology that Milo's expedition had, how did someone have the Leviathan? So how can it know more about everything? And why would it be written in Atlantis? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyant or astral travel can explain these things. However, clumsiness and astral travel do not require writing in Atlantis. So it should be a kind of automatic writing. Since no one has left Atlantis, it must be the spirits of the crystal radiant messages to the surface. It would have made more sense. But could also be explained in the movie: Milo could have discovered shepherd that this force has called him all his life - appears in dreams, etc. It had to be investigated in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Atlantians should simply not understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to speak in Europe, more than Romans would understand that hard "c" s or their day became French "ch" s (pronounced "sh" s, no less !) <br /> <br /> Current Atlantic Oceans were alive before the accident - when they apparently could * read, but now they cannot read what they used, or operate similar machinery. <br /> <br /> The Mass Literacy points to a major flaw in the movie. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. It looks suspended in the air until Milo can save it. Although life does not seem to be a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels. Perhaps it is a combination of Atlantic school systems running down the end and lacking in good fiction that caused Atlantis to invade illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kida can be excused because he didn't know how to read or use the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm or Stupidity set up. But ANY of her ** HARDLY ** qualifies her father for rejection !! Kashakim's folly almost overthrew his people. He killed a lot in the accident, disabled progress (not murdering many here, but he has made a massive slice in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone, if not even in lava was not cooked because the giant robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> A bolt of blue electricity had to destroy Kashakim's likeness when Kida tried to join her father's image at the circle of LARGE Kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantic, Rourke and others, knowing enough to look through a gibberish book and finding a page on a crystal - what he knew about being a crystal, not a stationary astrological or phases of the sun "diagram. <br /> <br /> If Milo's grandfather Rourke told about it, it still doesn't explain how Rourke would suffer as a result. Milo's read of it as part of the book To rip the page out - which was in Rourke's hand, was the puppy, although Milo apparently didn't find a torn page sign in the book - just there was pointing out the viewer that "something was not quite right." Unless the word "crystal" alarms in Milo's head would suggest someone would steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. br /> <br /> The crew's "double cross" was not a character change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Koekie with Rourke from the beginning was. However, the "change of heart" falls flat. It was a change, and had to be better motivated. Difficult to deal with characters who have been given nothing to start with. <br /> <br /> Niggling little that fills the lava over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we see the drive. This is fluid; It will not flow over the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> The end STINKS! - and make no sense except to saturate political correctness. With its power supply restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak force, which needs coddling. The giant robotic guardians and the airbikes shooting blue lightning indicate that they fear less of us than they may. The technology is better than ours, and certainly until early in the 20th century. In the end, Milo must teach the Atlantis to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their small, tranquil culture alone, so as not to send it into a hyped drive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Lost World plot and The turn of the century should give me a hint that it is a tribute to masses. The failures I find with the movie agree with this idea. But I have a loss why I have to be paid to see thin characters and just pick them up because many drunk novels have had them as well. And pulp stories are part of the "crap they can't sell anymore" anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated and our pulp must also grow up. Raiders of the Lost Ark did not lose any of their pulp and avoided so much bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is nice, but as I think about the plot, it's still lower.
