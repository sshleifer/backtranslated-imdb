(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks thought when they decided to cover $ 80m on this extremely tired and crippled animated movie. They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (mostly families) to see in herds. Well, it looked like it worked for the opening weekend, it made $ 26m, about and made $ 38.1m. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think hearing what happened over the weekend did pretty much the same thing I did when I saw it and they spread the word. This is one of the biggest films, apart from the animation, everything else, mostly the essay looks like a three-year-old. <br /> <br /> The movie is only about 80 minutes. long, but it feels like a three-hour epic. A few stickers to me are, and the annoying narrative is one of them, and it's so clearly written. At one point, he escapes some prisoners and although you can see that the horse is scared of course, the narrator (the voice of talented Matt Damon) appears to solve any misconceptions (which will only happen in the simplest way.) < br /> <br /> Another is the constant pop-up of Bryan Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but come on, Dreamworks really thinks the audience 8-9 Of his songs throughout such a short movie, I certainly can't. Finally, and here is a fairy tale, a horse is shot at a mere series by a member of the calvary, no less, then she (the horse) falls into a wild river, Spirit (the focus of the movie) tries to save her, but they both go over a waterfall that has at least a 50 foot drop. Well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. I know this is a children's movie, but even that small amount of realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a very lame moie, I don't say kids won't enjoy it, but anyone else will check their watches and wait just for this end. Definitely on my top 10 worst list this year. - ** out of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
