It's one of those movies where I wish I just stayed in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely boring. What a story is there is very thin and you should pretty much guess about it. The film offers pretentious camera techniques that seem to cause migraines and it looks like a student movie. Did I say it's boring already? If all the characters died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would have done less because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about it. This is the first time I've ever considered going out of a theater during a show, but I thought it was better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie with which you can threaten naughty children.
