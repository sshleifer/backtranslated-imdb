<br /> <br /> I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel. It came just after the first one. For some reason this movie was interested in me. I don't know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was nice how this guy got involved in making the movie. In the first movie he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this pursuit half of the murder / attempted murder was basically no reason. Stanley killed the director for creative differences. He caught the co-author because of creative differences, but what was the purpose of trying to kill the movie? No throw, no movie. He wanted it to "really look like they were dead"? If it were such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first one, the captive girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting up and disappearing. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie has HAD potential. And the sad thing about everyone ... the very sad part ... I'll see a "Cabin at the Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson and he is the only good part about this pursuit.
