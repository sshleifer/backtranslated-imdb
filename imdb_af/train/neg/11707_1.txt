This 2003 movie movie show was obviously shown on a women's channel. As a man, why do I even try to see it? I don't know, but I have to investigate my head. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed to give people injustice as he does. He picks up any power and belief a man can have by engaging in several boring women. Number one drill is Joyce Hyser as the woman. I couldn't wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing by most of the movie. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you ever want to meet. Her body didn't justify our foremost man to get the monkey over her and her acting was so obvious, just a fool could miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on recording the slut who seduced her own husband. He played again as a loser by David DeLuise. Anthony Denison is a lost coach but has nothing to do, but we gave it to our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say the victim was not so good. I first thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never got the part off the ground and was continually repeating. Although, as a man, I became furious when the two women got away with it. Men, beware of this channel that men drop and women even get away with murder. LMN is the channel. Beware. Note: After I accidentally looked at it a second time, I'm convinced of my first thoughts. Especially on writer / director, Simon Gornick. I still believe he has violated the male species and must be beaten by horse. The particular grace in this film is Tembi Locke who has not had the opportunity to show her talents with the terrible play of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Plus the silly plot that just makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and his vacant stars in it. LMN please do not show this trite again.
