First, the film, according to the movie, said it won the best movie at the "Worldfest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm had to be a quiet year. <br /> <br /> Shouldn't it be the worst movie ever, but it certainly struggles, it's just as awful as other Aussie B grads "Body Melt", but at least movie didn't look like it on HI 8 video shot. <br /> <br /> My guess is the movie makers, watched many Troma movies, and really bad B-grade movies, thinking they could also crack In the business that releases this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I really love low grade movies. Just the fact that some characters put on counterfeit American accent, almost as if it would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something. In fact, disappointing ends too, the revelation might have been much more exciting, and some good fighting scenes. You can quite see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with the whole, the car explosion, rocket age and endless amount of people being shot down, but the final doesn't have any top humor, or a bad style of taste " . <br /> <br /> If you like to watch really bad movies, or are interested in no budget film, watch it, otherwise stay away.
