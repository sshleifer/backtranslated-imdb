You can say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can it work? Is it possible? It seems to me a terrible choice, but maybe I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. he deducts it. <br /> <br /> NOT! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor, but he is a terrible Elvis, he is too short, too weak, too strong, well, you already thought how bad he would be, adding a hokey black wig and heavy-handed eyeliner and mascara, which is a big, vague embarrassment. <br /> <br /> can say is that Johnson's play is decent and since his personalization is so far away, you don't even think of him anymore as Elvis. You see him as another crazy pop star instead. Then, at that level, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the long beauty queen, Linda Thompson, but she is attractive in her own right and plays the role of honesty, elegance ie and intelligence we expected from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be a baptism to hold on to an abusive baptism. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new to this story; We've heard it many times. If you are looking for new information or insight, you will not find it. It is told as a love story - an unanswered one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
