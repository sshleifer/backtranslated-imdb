It's a very bad movie. The plot is sentimental. I think the production values ​​are OK, decent photography, unobtrusive direction and everything. Mark Hamill was terrible. I have never cared much for him, and this film confirms that perception. It's no wonder he never had a kind of career except his Star Wars movies. I'll just say, "Buh-bee, Mark," because he's sinking into well-deserved darkness. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts stole the show completely. She showed charm, beauty and acting in one show. I remember her recently in Texasville, and saw her beauty. It's interesting to see her ten years earlier. Anyway, unless you're interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie that shouts for the hills.
