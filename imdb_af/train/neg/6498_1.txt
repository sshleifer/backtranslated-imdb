I've seen bad movies before, but this one is by far the worst movie of a lifetime! Anthony Hopkins must be totally mentally ill to have his name here - everywhere! I will never see another movie with him, directing it, etc, etc! I can't believe the other actors and actresses I liked (in this photo), which has been so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some good drugs out there! For anyone who is not ashamed to be part of such a movie, it is beyond me! Save your money on this one! GREAT FLOP from start to finish! Sorry for your Mr. Hopkins! Also, shame on Christian Slater! I can't believe you put your reputation on the line for this one!
