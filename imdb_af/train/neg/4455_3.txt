Where to start? OK, don't compare this movie to fight club for a start - ridiculous. If it were even a plaster club, the violence, blood, gore, etc. would be much clearer and more realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a soccer factory - it is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby an embarrassment). Well enough, the storyline is pretty decent and the battle scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending that I can add. But the film in general is poor, seriously poor. As people mentioned, the accent shouldn't spoil a movie - I disagree - either a simple decision error or a lack of effort to divert the voices, causing the movie to become annoying - it was clearly from the scene one of American / Geordie plays the role. Don't get me wrong, nice guy, who looks good with a skin head - but no not a soccer hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the soccer field was - the 'false steward' situation. Even when the GSE United is going to play in the north, they go on the train and expect only 3 of them - don't make sense - it's a true organization of gangsters and thugs depicted in the movie mouse cult of about 5 . In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the past few years, were they in the Championship? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to waltz just in a Milwall firm pub. Basically, a very poor movie that people will want if they have little knowledge of true football and hooliganism. If you really love soccer and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism, you will just feel as if this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
