I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie was pain to me. I had to use fast to not sleep. It was boring! How can someone ruin this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were sh.t. They can't play the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a zero. Look at the other roles of this actor. The fighting tones were incredibly boring and not to follow, somehow they wouldn't follow the situation. Like other reviewers, low budget film with bad actors said. Maybe next time someone else can do a better thing from this title. French can't do the right thing with big movies like Alien 4. It was a bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
