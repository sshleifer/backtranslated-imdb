A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-pearl (least) dialogue plague this TV production that could hardly be interesting, even with a billion dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> The characters are not credible, in their motives, actions or in their careers. The plot reads like a bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM) hack but with plasma guns and power fields. There are serious continuity issues and the amount of useless interaction between characters at least stores this author. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the pest. See any episode of Dark Angel and you will perform better, have dialogue and plot. Bah.
