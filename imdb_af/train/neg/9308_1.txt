This movie was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I saw some pretty bad movies. I didn't like the way this movie was filmed. all the actors are unknown and a lot of friends seem to have come together and decided to film their own movie. but it is absolutely terrible. I've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and i just found it took a long time to get to the end of the movie. There was no plot, it looked like it wasn't planned before they started filming. The story is too strange. I didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. There was no point filming the movie. If you are considering watching this movie, don't do it. you just waste your time.
