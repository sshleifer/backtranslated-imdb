The biggest mistake in this movie is that it's impossible to believe any of these people will ever be thrown into a Macbeth professional production. Hearing David Lansbury's soft voice, which is struggling with the well-known "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech, made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider it. So I thought he didn't get the part, because he was a nice actor; not because a bigger name was available. Then, when we see parts of the drama in rehearsal, it's hard to believe that the director can't do things with a hopelessly disgusting, misguided actor who doesn't see the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball. pronounced or even understood. interpretations. Sometimes directors are so eager to have their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works) that they fix for less. It seems to be such an example.
