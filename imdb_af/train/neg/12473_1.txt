It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Everything is weak and incoherent. The acting is absurd, the costumes are even crumbled and the story doesn't exist. This "poverty drive" sword and adventure movie was meant to be the success of "Beastmaster" and "Conan", but it gives us no reason to follow along. The main character is clumsy and boring, he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is of the 16th century. All the action ranges are so, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the terribly dated musical play when riding their horse. Don't save this crap first.
