Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida. Where he meets a little penquin, which he tries to save from an Eskimo. These short tries and the penquin are treasure-rich, but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughing section. The Eskimo is not really that nice for a foil, and I only saw better Bugs Bunny cartoons, honestly, even other shorts when accompanied by other unknown antagonists. So I cannot recommend this one in good conscience. However, it's nice to see it in the unhealthy form. This cartoon is on Disk 3 of the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My Grade: C
