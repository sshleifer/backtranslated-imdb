I'm sorry, I know Fa√übinder is still one of the biggest directors in the post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered 'masterpieces', but if I see 'Lili Marleen' today, in 2004 wonder what everyone is up and down about this movie! The acting is just awful - Hanna Schygulla is everyone who smiles like an idiot! - The changes between Nazi brilliance and battlefields are ridiculous. The whole film seems to be made on a loft within two days. Probably it was exactly the same and many people seem to be "real art", but for me this movie is just bad and cheap. Compare it to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
