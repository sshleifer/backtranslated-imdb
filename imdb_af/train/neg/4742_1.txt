Wow. It was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with the hot Jock boyfriend and fast friends who are determined to be Homecoming Queen. She is supposed to save the world as a fighter, and Shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. And she has to learn some techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is ideal for kids who want to learn about Martial Arts and Chinese culture. but the play and the favor were terrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comic actress and I can't play her a serious role. It was laughing out loud and watching her cry about Shin. Shin couldn't act at all, and everything was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing I came across was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the stunts were so Power Ranger-esquire that it was just thin and stupid. The characters weren't nice and I just couldn't stand to see it. Disney should really take time to make good movies. High School Musical is the only movie to be earned on Disney Channel, along with other movies like Skippie, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weigh, and fast in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action adventure and funny jokes, you'll love this movie.
