It's an installment in the infamous Guinea range. A short-lived Japanese television program, which was canceled after a psychopath was recognized as being inspired by the death of a young schoolgirl at the show. This short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, virtually without any story. A group of guys caught a young woman. They bind her and continue to kill her while filming her. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her, and finally, in a "loving" close-up, push a needle through her eye. It is the most simple of all Guinea Pig movies, and one of the first. It was probably this movie, more than any of the others, that Guinea gave the rumor to sniff. They definitely gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage's movie "8mm." These movies have become very popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished but equally graphic films such as "Naked Blood". They probably fill the gap left by the Mondo movie, which is slightly cleaned and becomes reality TV. Not recommended, but will probably surprise those who see something once and wonder why I later know I did.
