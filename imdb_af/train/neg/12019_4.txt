I read some good reviews on this board for Mr. Scarface, but for everyone who is unlimited in the genre of Italian gangster movies like me, the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed, after the initial set-up of the ten million lira scam, the picture in a reasonable routine revenge movie conveyed with a small strife in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot came to me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers have said, he is the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons that Tony had been driving through the streets didn't actually go out until Tony even laid a hand on them. For all his build up as the title character, Jack Palance was rather uncertain in an anticlimactic near-final, Scarface made it earlier. I've seen enough spaghetti Western to know they don't work everything; I think in this case, my first glance at a spaghetti gangster movie didn't make it right either.
