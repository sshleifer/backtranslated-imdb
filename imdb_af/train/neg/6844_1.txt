I have a copy of this on VHS, I think they (the television networks) have to play it every year for the next twenty years. So we don't forget what was and we remember not making the same mistakes again. Like placing some people in the director's seat, where they don't belong. This movie Rappin 'is like a musical vaudevillian, for those who can't sing or act. This movie is so much fun trying to drive the 'blind' to run a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) is just out of jail and he's back to the old environment. Of course, to make time for an essential emergency crime. John heads back on the old street and is greeted by kids, old ladies and his peers as they dance and sing along the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if I was sentimental, or if someone was smoking a medicinal pot prescribed by a glaucoma doctor. Anyway, it is a poorly directed, written, acted and even produced (I never thought I put it) satire of the ghetto life with the 'Hood'. Although, I think the saving part of the story, by the wannabe gang battle sequence and the dance numbers, turns its friends over their neighbors and wants to save and tear the ghetto. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for this rap. Oh, now, if you want to make yourself silly and three-quarters embarrassed, first drink. <br /> <br /> Please, look responsibly. (No stars, better luck next time!)
