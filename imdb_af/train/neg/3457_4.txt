This movie was made and thrown out of my hometown. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hassle over the fact that Molly Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> Essentially 20 years after a movie laid to rest "without finishing, a group of film students have postponed it - with serious consequences. It seems as if someone doesn't want to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The storyline is faint. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore a little bit has to be taken in the cheek, but it didn't have a real oomph. It doesn't seem to matter, it is strange to hear Kylie's accent again as Australian and nice to see a child. I went to school with a lead role, but it does not solve the film at all. the creators thought they would get in Molly Ringwald, perhaps because of the nature of the movie (it gives a tribute to 80's movies / bad horror movies), but really a Aussie actor would have done just fine. <br /> <br /> As far as it is decided, it's very important. the acting was constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main children - they played directors and producers) seemed to be trying to act. It's never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feeling about them. About relieving? Just not as smooth as one is used to. <br /> <br /> The killer. Lord. Can it be less scary? There are a few shock factors and some gross scenes. I liked the movie, but it wasn't good. It went for 90 minutes, but could have gone for less. Maybe if they fitted the writing, it would have been better. They killed many characters - but no real build up to kill them. Maybe if they killed fewer people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's a comedy and elements were funny. Or so incredible they were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
