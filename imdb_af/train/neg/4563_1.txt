This movie is probably the cheapest, cutest and poorest successor ever made. <br /> <br /> Still, it's the funniest and most idiotic movie of Disney, and it'll be sure to laugh at the juicy stories and end up from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's a group of short stories that look like bad fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first is all about Beast and Belle that is small about a pathetic argument. Then three looser new characters decide to upload things by giving a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle. Sharing this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which made my brothers and sisters and I laugh so hard. Then, she and the Beast fight more about the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they ??? Surely old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> The following is all about Lumiere which is the world's biggest baptism when it comes to romance. It comes from the man who can woo any woman. And they make FiFi a psychotic villain who tries to kill Belle, and winds up to make dish-free at the end. What a message to send the kids! <br /> <br /> Then the following is all about Mrs. Potts angsty. And the next is all about Beast being overly owned by a bird to the point where he just seems foolish. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 bugs you can see ... and the color is terrible. <br /> <br /> Belle is a simmering juice that blubbers when something goes wrong. Plus, she is small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere are fighting almost all the time. I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated in it.) <br / > <br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She is devastated in this. I can't even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1/10 for the juice, but I'm giving it a 10/10 for the comedy.
