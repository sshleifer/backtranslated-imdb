Best-selling author George Plimpton (Alan Alda) commissioned Sports Illustrated. He will go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try to be a third-series quarterback position. He is quickly invented by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer's determination for the quarter-finals for a series in a real game. <br /> <br /> This movie is Alda's debut and also helped Karras play the gridiron. In addition to the 1968 Detroit lions, the cast also includes 'Sugar Ray' Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March leads this story based on Plimton's book.
