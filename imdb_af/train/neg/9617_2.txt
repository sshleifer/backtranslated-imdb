Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was with her friends at the lake when her brother dropped out of a boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop hitting and blaming herself for something she didn't control. So grab the brew and something to chew and return to the same lake that was in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a massacre already started when two of the friends jumped before even going to the party. This movie has the feel of a high school game where everyone has forgotten their lines and 'winged' ... very bad! Author Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meat-based role as Rachel's boyfriend Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel, there is a little lame acting and a few characters that you want to choke the khaki before being "offed". Pay attention to some of the nerve players that appeared: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a MEMORIAL DAY that you will not forget.
