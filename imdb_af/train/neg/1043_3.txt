What a bad, bad movie !!! I can't believe all the hype loaded on this pretentious, amateur excuse for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, amazed at how badly the direction and camera work of that movie was !! And to read adoring paeans who claim there is truth and reality in this movie when everything is in fact a brazen attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of judges and festivals by being cheap and foolish. <br /> <br /> At least this movie once and for all showed me that the Sundance festival has become a complete joke and that it is shown here is more a label of bad movies than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You will want your time again! I know I did it.
