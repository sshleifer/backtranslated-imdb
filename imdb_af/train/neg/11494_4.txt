Richard Dix is ​​a large, not very beautiful industrialist, who has worked himself almost to death. If he takes the holiday that his doctors suggest to him, can he find happiness in the last few months of his life? Well, he'll probably be better off if he ignores the VOICE OF WHISTLER. <br /> <br /> This William Castle live entry has some good moments (the introduction and portrayal of Richard Dix's life through the news rule la Citizen Kane), and some interesting plans in the final roles . Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But unfortunately the just doesn't work right, because one doesn't end up buying that the characters will do the way they do. The movie is also from a dark (and fascinating start) to an almost cheerful 30-year-old movie like a mid-section (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind being rich) and back to a complex noir -plot for the last 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> It's a decent movie worth watching - but it needs a bit more running to set up a few characters and a female who is capable of claims of her role.
