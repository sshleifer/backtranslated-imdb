I have a good movie collection, and this one was added. Number 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title had me first. Spatter University. I thought it would be a big horror movie. Was I ever wrong. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all movies, but this one was one that laughed and then scared. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, poor acting and poor shooting arrangements are some of the areas that could be improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Film is ideal for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of those movies to make fun, then this is one!
