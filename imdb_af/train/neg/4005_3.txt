I'm a real fan of the original Cracker series, and all of them are on DVD. Cracker had a tendency to be top-down sometimes, but Robbie Coltrane and the other members, as well as the authors, always seemed to be wearing it. I count the original Cracker under the big Brit TV crime series of that time, and there's a stiff competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes, and a host of others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What makes a new terror increasingly sad ... <br /> <br /> Eventually, it was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, convinced it couldn't be that bad, and that some spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from start to finish. <br /> <br /> A few criticisms: First, to get rid of any potential bias, I insulted the anti-American anti-war. strap that turned most of the show up and down. The top: The murder of two Americans who are innocent of any crime and a British junkie is understandable in Fitz's words but not justified. I thought, "I slapped for two hours just to hear this disgusting piece of thirst?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone brought by my beliefs. Apart from politics, I had the clear feeling that this Cracker was just a prop for the propaganda and it actually helped an already undermined terrible writing. <br /> <br /> Second, how much time did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a little player in this one, as if he were an afterthought written in a story originally written, without thinking about Fitz's role. Coltrane could have worn the show on his own and still fit thin shoulders, but the writer apparently thought of other things and missed the chance and wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT AN ABYSMAL SCRIPT! There was a twinkle and a few bits of actual character development (Fitz's son who had the Fitz's ranting could not stay at his home when he took his plane to Australia, the detective who left his poor artists over the backs of their heads, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus), but not nearly enough to carry the boring story. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where was hell hell? Now it would have been interesting. It's Manchester, and ten years later she's in the ranks. Another missing event (or maybe the actress wasn't interested?) Well, there are many more (it's bad) to say, but I'll close with curiosity: at the end of the show (like that broadcast on BBCA), when the ad announced that the "Director's Cut" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! The director's cut, which is supposed to pay one, has all the stuff I expected tonight, but never done, like a coherent, interesting story. Unfortunately, having convinced myself to sit through the terrible free version of a new terror, hoping to see something, anything worth looking at, just to be disappointed, I have no hope of motivate me to actually pay for a second, potentially longer and more boring version. In addition, it made me angry to think that the BBCA cut and cut and offered to accommodate the endless (every ten minutes or so) stream of ads, and then turned around and asked to pay for what would probably be the version tonight broadcast. . <br /> <br /> To close, I pick up the first paragraph of Variety's review of a new terror: it really says it all: "Initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane as his role as the BBC's flawed, smashing criminal psychologist is being killed by the heavy political statement, author Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver vidpic within the revival, for the first time in his message - that Americans are a bunch of shiny namby pambies who don't mind Whit over terrorism before it crashed on our doorstep - McGovern's breast clearance rumbles over the story and mutilates the pleasure of seeing Fitz back on the case.
