Actually a disgusting, dirty movie, with only a small amount of real humor. The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme (deliberately so, of course) and portrayed in the most pathetic, seedy way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this movie very disturbing, with absolutely no redeeming features. Frankly, I wish I had never seen it before. <br /> <br /> I see this British attempt to be a sick and brutal embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this movie have a totally lacking ability: the joy in a show of deep depravity and villain. <br /> <br /> The producers have to be ashamed.
