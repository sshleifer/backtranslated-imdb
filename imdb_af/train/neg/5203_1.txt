I saw poor movies in my time, but it really takes the cookie! Why, why was this movie made? There is nothing here at all. Please put your trust in me, turn off the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... it can take about 5 minutes to show on the camera. This is the key problem, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... whatever) lends itself in no way to being knocked out for 80 minutes. And so we have to watch people walk around for more than an hour. This is it! In the first half of an hour, nothing happens, except that someone walks to a store ... and then three guys go through a wood. This time maybe the development of character might be devoted ... but no. And so there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, and once they start shooting, we can not care less! In fact, in the end I was determined for the bath so the movie would end! In addition, the work of the camera is really awful! This director / editor / writer / manufacturer, Ti West is junk. I hate to hit a man, but really, his job is pants! These dull close ups constantly, and then long single take following people as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so juicy that I just wanted to stop the movie and tear my wrists! How this man was brought to the next cabin fever movie is outside me! To finish, the play is also discouraged ... which goes for the film as a whole. Keep your common sense, keep away from this hope of total crap!
