What was the purpose of this movie? I suggest it was a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday to do nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. A Braindead ex-pugilist falls with a strange woman and her family. He started out as a regular man for the woman and hit a man and got caught up in a kidnapping scheme. It was so confusing that I couldn't even write a decent criticism. If you see this one, my sweet, make sure it is after dark, so you can sleep right.
