In fact, this movie, made in 1999, has fairly good production values. The actors are attractive and fairly talented. There aren't a lot of clowns moving around, bringing out hundreds of laps, but never touching flesh. There is also no wild car hunt or accident where thousands of dollars of valuable beautiful machines are useless. <br /> <br /> The interiors look respectfully modern, architecture, and the equipment looks sniffing. Well, there is the high-tech computer room furnished with what looks like leftover from a 50s electronic laboratory. And the pancake makeup on the bodies struck me. Not conventional pancake make-up, but that looks like a dried pancake batter over their exposed skin. It is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified - although how the virus will reach this transmutation is an exercise for the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the virus. I want to tell you that this is not the absolute worst point of departure for a sci-fi, horror movie I know but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television or computer monitor and becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Go break. Warp drives a la "Star Trek" is one thing, but photons become viruses? It's so stupid that the desired "scare factor" just isn't feasible. The movie could have used one of those horrible dream sequences where the dead got alive, or a cat jumped out of the closet, or something, because the viral dingama jig didn't. <br /> <br /> One supposes that Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this filth that Lord Oliver gave to some of his later, trashy places. He needed the money. However, no other comparison between the two must be explained.
