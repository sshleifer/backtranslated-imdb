May I have $ 13.00 back? I used to look at "Hydro-Electric Power coming to North America". Again. It's a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes from each character's mouth, regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again, I have to charge at least $ 150 per hour. And I'm not taking insurance. It was honest to see Willrell Morley playing in Woody. But I don't think imaginative pouring is enough. One has to wait until they have a story before they make a movie. Unless he just does it for the money. And if that's the case, why not just get an All-Rap version of "What is Tiger Lily?".
