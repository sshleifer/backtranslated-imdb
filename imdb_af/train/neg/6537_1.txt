Firstly, I was warned that I saw this movie on TV and had been baptized with English - which could have totally spoiled the atmosphere. However, I will judge what I have seen and hope it will send people off that version. I found this movie incredibly boring. All the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing, which leaves the slow frustration of a stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is slow, except for the film about philosophy. I have not seen a deep philosophical meaning in this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell it as I see it. I rated it a "1". What can I say, maybe American oriented taste?
