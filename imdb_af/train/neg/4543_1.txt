I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This movie, it's direction, the screenplay, and the acting was totally impossible. I clipped the lack of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possible fact-based story. <br /> <br /> I can see why this movie isn't released to the general public in most cities. Will ever recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> One of the worst adjustments I've seen has been in a plot less exploration of heaven on earth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was indeed the only highlight. But how can this fail when filmed in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> For prospective viewers, don't waste your time or energy on this flop.
