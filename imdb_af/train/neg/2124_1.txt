This film relates to the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming for old friends in a marine community. The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy is away as a way of dealing with the death of a friend in which he somehow feels responsible. But this is inconspicuous, as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenplays do not always have to be "chatty", but at least they need to help develop the story. Here's one line of effort like "he just retired" or "I know you don't have love in your heart", just do something worth the time of the audience. Also, when the writer feels too little where to go to the next, he cuts to a musical feature of the main character walking through the fields to some indie-mood music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the type that gives quality and substance to style, then it's not the movie for you.
