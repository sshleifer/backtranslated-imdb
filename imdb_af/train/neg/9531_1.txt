It's a horrible movie. Two demented young women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away about a plot or a spoiler. I will only comment that the termination is almost the leading part of the movie. Many of the films unnecessarily involve Locke and Camp cackling, while smiling psychologically at the camera. Add a repetitive soundtrack, including a vaudevian song about "dear old dad" that shows an intriguing quality that the viewer never really sees. The music is initially annoying and ultimately ends up exposing the viewer to a torture that is worse than that displayed on the screen. The theme here is from the youth runner amok, understandable as a response to the 60's, but with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
