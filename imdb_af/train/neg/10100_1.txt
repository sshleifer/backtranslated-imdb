I usually support independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant. I tend to support everyone because their efforts are worth it ... <br /> <br /> but this movie just moves away from all understanding and tolerance. limits! <br /> <br /> Suggest the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the REALLY WORST horror movie you've ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. Think of a great, attractive art for the movie's DVD box ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> see it only if you really have nothing else to do. Anything is better.
