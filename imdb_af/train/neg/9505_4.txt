I'm not going to criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. It has good animal activities which were rather surprising at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matinee idol. He is a little light and not very pretty. But that's right. He's the man in that lion's cage. We know that when he cannot take the time of his lions to incline his girlfriend, he will end up with her on an island and save the day. Someone once said it was a history lesson. The scenes at the circus are from another day, especially the children hanging around. I did not realize that they even flung three masters in the thirties. It looked like something from 1860. I think it's the stock image they had. No wonder the thing was ruined. They always talk to solve her. There is even a dirigible. It tells us a bit about male female relationships at the time, a kind of giggly silliness. But if you don't take it too seriously, you can enjoy it.
