This movie was just bad. Almost every police clique is present and accountable. Bad guy gets away? cheque. Partner? cheque. Wacky personality collision with partner? cheque. Rookie with something to prove? cheque. Rookie points to a grizzled veteran. cheque. About the only one who didn't touch it, was idiot shooting themselves in the foot and retirony, but I think they save those old chestnuts for Dooley's next outing. In the battle of the sexes with Girl Power, along with tired old giggles and banal exaggerated material such as Dooley's prize engine, all the time and you have the recipe for one very bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.
