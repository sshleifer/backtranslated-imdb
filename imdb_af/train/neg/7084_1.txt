As many others have said, it's a terrible movie, of every aspect of movies. How they ever got famous names actors to tackle this project is wonderful. Many people have complained that it was shot at 'cheap' video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not "cheap" video. What made it bad was the lighting, white balance, shooting technique and editing. <br /> <br /> There were so many different shooting and editing techniques used to be a production game. Hard, inconsistent lighting, the use of handheld shooting (ala Woody Allen), cunning editing (another Allen technique), but poorly done, without real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing; very amateurist. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scene had no values ​​at any level. <br /> <br /> How this video ever made it print is beyond me. It's worth checking to see if you're just surprised at how bad it is.
