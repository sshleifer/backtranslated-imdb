Valentine is a terrible movie. That's what I thought of it: <br /> <br /> Acting: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can't act. The other is not much better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was okay, but it could have been more developed. This movie has the potential to be a good movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name `Paige Prescott 'recognizes Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Don't see Valentine. It's a very silly movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
