I returned this movie and the original Carlitos Way. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know people are going to say the prequel was made on a small budget, but it had nothing to do with a bad writing. Now it's just me, but I always thought that a prequel was made to compile the other movie, with key characters and maybe a little about life we ​​didn't know. Standing on Power is just a movie with Carlito's name. There must be at least a few characters from the original movie, the end doesn't make sense to the original. At the end of this movie, he goes down with his lovely heart, but how's hell going to get him out of jail in the next movie? And his wife isn't even the same woman he's talking about as his only love in the original. I would say the movie is generously entertaining in its own right, with some decent bits, but it looks like it's a big brother. Don't wake up at night and wait to see it, look at the original one once you really need a hit.
