When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, I thought it was too hard, but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, laughed very little and the jokes were stale. Obviously, the joke will turn to Marlon Wayans, who plays a mature midget that was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond intended for a gangster. Things are going wrong and the little one has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To get the diamond back, the midget suggests being an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couple. Of course, he is caught up and the drama starts looking for the diamond. <br /> <br /> The film features actress and actresses of Saturday Night Live such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider of In Living Color. However, all these talents cannot help the poor writing and jokes that were simply not funny. <br /> <br /> The special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a miniature was OK. I mean, it wasn't 100% credible, but it was OK ... nothing good. I just wish the Wayans brothers took more trouble developing a script with good jokes, rather than trying to find their poor writing with cameos from their famous comic actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> Wait for cable or television. It's really not worth any amount of money.
