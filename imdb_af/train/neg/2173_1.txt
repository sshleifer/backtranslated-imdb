If you rent a movie titled "Exterminators of the Year 3000," chances are good, you know what you're getting into yourself. I myself was sold by the promising descriptions of "nuke mutants," "motor psychos" and of course the "exterminators" themselves who, according to the back of the movie shop case, are all cavorting around a post-apocalyptic bare desert causing all sorts of chaos . Let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffets take place - at least, so was my hope for this "movie". <br /> <br /> Now I like the occasional horrible movie, and if you read the comments on Exterminators of the year 3000, you probably do. That said, I got this movie a "1" (horrible) - not because I totally hated the movie, but because it is one of the most legitimate terrible attempts I've ever seen. The dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, the audio editing, the editing in general, the plot, etc. Etc., Etc. - Everything is worthy, which must be low spectator expectations, given that wonderful title. <Br /> <br /> So what is really good about this bad movie? It does have some of what my circles are lovingly suggesting. Killing a quality, for those who are unfamiliar with the phrase, is not a hard and fast term, but generally refers to someone who is killed in a particularly gruesome, creative or ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Exterminators of the year 3000 also have a fair offer of 'dialogue-as-bad-it-be funny', largely by Crazy Bull, the appropriate title leader of the unfortunate car soul gang, provided. kill the quality (if you hope for big things from the nuke mutants, think again, they essentially play zero in the movie ... shucks!). However, Crazy Bull is all you can ask in a b-movie car psycho. Shakespeare paraphrase and strange PG style insults are all he knows how to say ... and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite the quality of death and the bad dialogue, but if you are looking for a really entertaining bad movie, Exterminators of the Year 3000 makes it disappointing, as it is limited to things such as foolish and outdated special effects, quality death and bad dialogue. There is simply not enough to justify a full feature length, mainly because of the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car hunters and long desert hiking trails. All in all, a pretty good, horrible movie, but hey, it's not Death Race 2000.
