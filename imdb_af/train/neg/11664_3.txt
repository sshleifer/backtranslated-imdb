I really wanted to enjoy this movie. It moved very slowly and was just boring. If it was on TV, it would have been 15 to 20 minutes. Maybe. What happened to the story? A good player and photographer went wrong. If it's loosely based on the life of the director, why didn't he get someone to see that the writing was "loose"? Then he set it in a snail's pace that could be the source of a few people who were hurt during the movie. The music is rising, but for another movie, not this one ... For soap opera story. There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller talked to Stahl. I wasn't alone because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. Why can't Hollywood make better movies? This one had the sophistication of a great story, but was just poorly executed.
