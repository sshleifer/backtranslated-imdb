I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the previews. Usually I see a preview of this good and I buy the movie straight. Something told me ... you know it first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley ruined all of my future movies with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out, I was going to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hate her more for that. I think it had to do with her hair and it had to be cut short for Domino. <br /> <br /> Who is Domino? Who is Domino Harvey? I don't really know or care. I don't know who she was in the real life or who she was in this movie. I didn't care about her character, and even Keira became partisan and didn't make it worth it. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was solid and level. The editing was terrible. I don't care about the style as much as its poor over-utilization. There is a place for that. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colorful editing (not sure if there is an official name) will be Fight Club; just off the top of my head. Even enemy of the state had a semi-similar editing style to parts. It has been tastefully used and not used as a crutch. I mean it's the same man who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand there are many people who like this movie. I think the idea that you will love or completely hate this movie is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate it.
