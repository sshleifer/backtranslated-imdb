This movie feels so empty. In every scene in the movie, the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10. Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen, there are never more extras and the movie just feels strange. <br /> <br /> The VERB was FOLLOWED! It's so obvious, it was in front of a blue screen, because all the action scenes you can see are the actor / actress running about halfway when running for their lives. Look at the floor for their points ... <br /> <br /> Spoilers: You also find yourself heading and watching the movie. At one point at Sky Captain's home base, they have 100 planes on the landing strip. They have advanced warning that an attack is coming ... So what are they doing? nothing. All the aircraft are inflated and again the only person fighting back is the Sky Captain ... <br /> <br /> The whole world is attacking and he is the only person ever to fight back. At the end of the movie you finally see hundreds of plains ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
