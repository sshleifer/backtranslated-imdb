* SOILER * It's Fake! The whole thing is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin, brother or half-brother or something wants the castle and its title for itself. So he invests this overly complex and unnecessary useless plan, viz. SCOOBY-DOO, to manage Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movies he picks up redhead and attacks. He didn't even kill them. He falls asleep and the girl disappears and he thinks he has buried them. If he looks at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he can say she's wearing gloves! My God who is a waste of time. Don't bother it, rent it and if you've bought it and haven't watched it, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from the night that came out of the grave. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
