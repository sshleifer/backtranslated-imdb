I wouldn't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than that. It was completely old-fashioned. At every stage of this movie I was hoping for a spin and what did I get? The girl is burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /> <br /> In spite of being engaged, they must get permission for every little move they make. They are so embarrassed, even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was cry. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have kids, but we don't look at them and always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's the other way around. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
