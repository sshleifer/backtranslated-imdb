Hollywood Hotel was the last movie music that Busby Berkeley directed to Warner Bros. His directional style has changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or large production numbers, with thousands of extras. By the last few years of the Thirties, heavy-duty gangs recorded the year's biggest popular hits. The Swing Era, also known as the Big Band Era, was dated from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. While it is impossible to determine the moment the Swing Era began, Benny Goodman's involvement in the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was definitely one of the early indications that the consciousness of the mainstream Enter America's youth. When Goodman knew his heavy repertoire rather than the soccer dance music that his band played, the youth became wild in the audience. This was the beginning, but since the radio, live concerts and mouth-to-mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena. It took a long time before swinging enough input to produce big hits that appeared on the pop cards. In Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his band and Raymond Paige and his band in the film indicate that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste (the film was only a year and a half or more in production after Goodman's Palomar Ballroom involvement). There are some interesting musical moments here and there in Hollywood Hotel, but besides Benny Goodman and his band's "Sing, Sing, Sing", there's not much to recommend. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the production number "Hooray for Hollywood" and the "Let It A Lesson for You" at the drive restaurant. The movie is interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his band, and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
