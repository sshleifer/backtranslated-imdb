When this cartoon first raced out, I was under the impression that it would be at least halfway off, son I was wrong. I have to admit that this cartoon is almost as painful to see Batman and Robin with George Clooney years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of them literally got Batman his ass, kicked left and right by Penguin who fought like Jet Li and hit the shit out of Batman and I watched another episode where Batman kicked kicked again by the Joker, who apparently used Jackie Chan, as he flickered in the air like a ninja. Ever since when was the Joker or the Penguin ever a game for Batman? And even worse, Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts were Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It is truly embarrassing, depressed and sad as Batman's image is portrayed in this show. The animation is terrible and the dialogue is terrible. As a Batman fan since my son, I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, as it does not portray the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a Wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, I strongly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and don't waste your time with this cartoon.
