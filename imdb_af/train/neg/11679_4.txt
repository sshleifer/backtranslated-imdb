First, this movie is not a thriller. It is also not "gripping, stiff." It might have been based on writing, but the direction of the slow pace makes it difficult to enter. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately we only get a feeling of * how * ingeniously after the picture is over. It allows us to play with over two hours of music sequences played over them by some action scenes that the viewer does not grab, and 'rogue vixen' scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish it was the quick stuff that the box promised. It would have been an excellent movie. Instead, Spike Lee made it flow through the end.
