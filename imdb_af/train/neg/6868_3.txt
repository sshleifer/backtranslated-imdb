OK, albeit as an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I'm going to be a bit biased against this movie. However, it appears that Boaz Yakin's only purpose in making this film was Orthodox bashing. With our wigs, modest clothes, and separate seats, we are already a fairly easy target. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a movie with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia to love him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately tested his father's command that he did not swim because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son's breeze. Why would a Hasidic wife of Monsey have such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that she has never attended once. Let's look at it, even the Reformation of Jews today holds bris milah ceremonies. 3. Was Mendel slept during his chosson classes? He was supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had been married for more than a year and just noticed they weren't meant for each other? A small clue-arranged marriage does not mean the girl should take the first guy her parents did to her. Also, she will not be avoided by the community if the marriage does not work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted her to be so sorry in the jewelry business, she didn't have to go through her fraudulent son-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came down as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she went back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she had not had the outcome. It is not the environment; It is pandering to stereotype. Honestly, I think she has what she deserves.
