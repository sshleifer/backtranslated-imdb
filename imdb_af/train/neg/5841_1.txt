Spoiler below, but read on or you'll never know the terrible lot waiting for plans to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a lunar night, in a remote research laboratory, a major medical breakthrough is over having fatal results. A chemical compound created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells leaked out of the hazardous waste disposal system into the building's basement. Now the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment are not the only rats in the facility that will be the altered species. Professor Schultz, a leading bio-researcher, has just found that adding a new enzyme can now regenerate its "hunting and destroying" formulation for the time needed to neutralize deadly cancerous tumors. When three different grades of the new mixture are applied to three different rats and the rest is poured into the faulty zinc waste, shocking side effects cause a night of terror ..... right ..... /> <br / > Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Everything about it shouts "Low budget!", From the terrible that deals with the special effects that are the worst I've ever seen. The characters are clich√©d morons and act in stupid, predictable ways: walk alone in the dark corridors, search for a cat, turn and fall so that the "rats" can overtake them, step into a small room, etc. While some movies are made cheap, this film really takes the cake. Every possible angle is cut, all from the reuse of earlier shots, the filming of the "Lab" paths from different angles to make it look bigger (It reminds me - why were there only TWO guys in this freakin massive building ??), on music and special effects that can be done on a children's workshop computer. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming dung - the special effects. Just awful. The computer-generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene, so even the stupid movie buffs can see that they're computer-generated. And that giant gear suit - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! seriously, are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster? Just diligent ........ On the other hand, some of the gore looks pretty cool, especially in light of the budget. <br /> <br /> The actors all suck. No one involved in the production cared for or knew what they were doing. I wasted enough time with review, just my advice, it's garbage. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: The transmission sucks, the sound is sensible and there is a commentary on the disc by the director and two of his friends who say they have absolutely nothing to do with making the movie but was there to ask questions and comment. All three of these sub-human transfers are so incredibly stupid that they must be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I don't want to waste your kind of reader's time or me anymore, because I'm starting to remember more than I want about this movie ..... DVD rating: 1/10.
