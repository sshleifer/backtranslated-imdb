I didn't even know it was originally a TV for the television when I saw it, but I recommended it through the running time. It has the same elaborate colors, bare characters, and terribly synthesized music I remember from the 80's, plus a social platform that almost shouted to the special school. Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe's (thank you) Mazes and Monsters were made in the boom of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks in America. I count myself one of the geeks mentioned, that I have never played D&D, specifically I slept in one of his brothers. M & M was also made into the boom of D&D controversy - it was so annoying that people could touch reality, worship Satan without knowing, blah blah. I think it's a fair matter at one point, if it's extremely scarce, but it makes this movie awful. <br /> <br /> We meet 4 young college students playing the pleasant Mazas and Monsters, socializing and having some time away from everyday life. Except that M & M, as offered, is more boring than their everyday lives. None of the gaming world is being presented here - and Jay Jay's request to take M&M into the "real world" comes from nowhere. It's just an excuse to let one of the characters get hit, even so. But at that stage we don't really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different, but they are all rich in WASPy problems that have problems, no one really has. <br /> <br /> But things just go on, get worse in more ways than one. The low budget is very obvious. (I love the 'entry sign' and cardboard cutout to the forbidden cavities). Robbie / Pardu shows why he's not yet a fighter in the oafiest stepping-up scene, and the payout to the Two Towers is inadvertently hilarious. Tom Hanks 'blubbering' Jay Jay, what am I doing here? 'let me laugh for a few minutes. Definitely the low point in his career. <br /> <br /> Don't see it as an offensive satire, just a happy 80's TV out and you'll have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but it's all worth it for Pardu's outline at the end. At least Tom Hanks got better. Not that he can get much worse from here.
