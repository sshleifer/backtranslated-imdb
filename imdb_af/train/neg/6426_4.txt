I found the documentary titled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be a pretty interesting documentary. The documentary document contains four "mini" documentaries on four interesting men. Each of these men was very involved in his work and had mere love and enjoyment for the work. <br /> <br /> Sharing, I must say, will be the subjects in which these individuals worked / studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, and then they became boring and stayed too long. <br /> <br /> However, the video was filmed in a very creative way. I really enjoyed the movie of one thing with a voice sounding over the other. It played excellently and also coincided well with that music.
