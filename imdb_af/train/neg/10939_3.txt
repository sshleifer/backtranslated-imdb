This movie has some of the worst plays I've ever seen! Some scenes are originally as the nails come through the floor. This nail trap attracts these bad guys. The rest of the movie humiliates as you go. I can't believe this movie isn't even in the bottom 100 movies of all time. I also can't believe there was prosecution! The next crap movie I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Can R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this? <br /> <br />
