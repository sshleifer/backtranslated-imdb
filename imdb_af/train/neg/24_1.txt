I must congratulate the genius that approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think, you can't grab every piece of low-cost amateur crap. The only purpose is to get some money. <br /> <br /> Filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera will get the same result, or better. <br /> <br /> The acting just says: don't look for the supermarket for actors. The goods usually come with a degree or, at least, have a painful experience! The director. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your goal in life, as a director you just suck. Your direction is poor, the corners are all wasted (not in a good way), the lines seem to be read from toilet paper and the damn music. It always comes up as it does and doesn't go out for no apparent reason. And don't go for the writer either. Making movies is not like serving on a coffee shop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you will ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you have to shoot this one back to oblivion and wait for something good to come up. Or just go to a coffee shop. You will have less tension and you will save a little money and a bad evening. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first one)
