I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. After all, I am an open minded man and I have given good reviews to some nice bad movies. As the end credits rolled on this one, I searched for meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: "This movie was graciously short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> All right, okay. The sets and footage were well done and the music helped to borrow the soul of the asylum, but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue kept away from the good bits. I laughed at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend, who has embarrassed him before a great crowd. <br /> <br /> By the time of the "chicken dance" in the final I had just decided to roll and roll the film and drop the bodies where they fell. I don't know what the movie could have recovered. The acting wasn't bad and it looked like it had a budget, but there wasn't just a way to make it visible; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have created a baptism or a lot of beer to get the full experience of the movie. Anyway, I don't watch this movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say, "At least I wasn't in." Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. "I'm better than these guys."
