Very unquestionable, incredible and incoherent Spanish production about ... well, let me see how close I can get it. The film opens with a woman with one of her cat's death by a young girl. She commands her beloved to take her somewhere on his vacation. He calls work and demands that he lose his holiday time and she says he will pay for this. The relevance of this is someone's guess at the end of the movie, because the man, a swarthy photographer, boasts a beautiful Patty Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror movies, it seems to her bikini in a short time so he can snap a photo, ask her out for lunch, and then after his command to Witches Mountain - for reasons we are never able to. Before they go, Patty has to stop at home and loud, "ominous" one day in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues with the two stopping at an inn, going to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called Hexesberg. You know, there are several aspects of this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has a little atmosphere, some of the character elements are really pretty good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman), the lead is at least adequate, and the climax - although it has absolutely no sense - is well choreographed (literally ) with the witches in white brassiere and long black hair. It just makes no sense, and it is a great opponent for me. I could watch the movie ten more times and don't know more than I did after the first viewing. This is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious movie from the long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror movies that covered that decade. If you can get more out of it than I do, better power for you.
