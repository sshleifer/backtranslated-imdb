In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero of the United States. People in his position inevitably get movies that only exist to capitalize on them. I have no idea what Thomas was paying to make this movie, but I had to pay a lot of money to agree to make a national fool in my movie. The film is obviously derived from "Enter The Dragon," as most martial arts photographs. Only instead of real art, they faced an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as a cross between Kung Fu and dance. A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to save a lady from an impenetrable fort, but each room has a prop that is exactly what Thomas the assistant has to do bad things. Of course, he fights his way to the main villain, and of course they have a fancy-dancy battle, ending with only those who have never seen a marshal art film. There are touches that will have nostalgic types, especially Thomas's mullet haircuts and many of the male co-stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, now wishing he never put a foot on the movie set.
