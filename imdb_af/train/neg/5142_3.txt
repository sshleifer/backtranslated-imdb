After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dinamite, he has one of his worst: Gentlemen or Nerve. During this first year in movies, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, location shooting, etc. This one takes place on a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to go in without paying. Mabel Normand is also with her friend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of his and Mabel's friends. He then wakes Mabel in the stall without any clear repercussions of his behavior. Very slapstick here, but there is very little else to recommend this movie to others, and look to develop Chaplin. The pressure I saw was badly affected, which affected his enjoyment. Charley Chase can be seen. * of 4 stars.
