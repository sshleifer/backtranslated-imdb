Not even worth watching this sturdy spoiler, everything ruins about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost inexpensive through the poorly written storyline and they have a low quality feel to the production. It was made very clear for TV, but if I got it on my television, I would overload it straight. The children in the film do a good job, but the adult acting is incredible and so the film is not really recorded. This film lacked the music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and truly shone Annie's shine. love everything. Johnson, because Annie is sometimes annoying and handsome. You can't believe she's really Annie. The differences in character appearance irritated me throughout the film. Sad to say this successor was a total flop.
