If he wanted to be accurate, he had chosen some Frisco natives and not a lot of NY actors who didn't know anything about the Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I lived in SF all my life, and people don't talk or act like these actors did. Everything is too dramatic, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the movie who really dressed like cats here (ie his Warriors jersey). Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear; Instead, he fitted them in some cheesy SF or Oakland jerseys that aren't even sold here. HP has no building lines, black and Asian gangsters do NOT wear head or wristbands with the colors of Africa or China's Olympic team. Every Chinese gangster also doesn't wear a Yao Ming jersey and tries to sound black while shooting hoops. Furthermore, while there is now an important yuppie community that invaded the mission, everything shown is a white man and a 100% west coast Boriqua. It's NOT New York! Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from the ONE shown here, which was without a doubt from NY. Also, HP is not the only black town in the city. A correct depiction would be the drama between HP sets in their own chase as well as vs. Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if Lee did even more homework and had a better storyline to work with.
