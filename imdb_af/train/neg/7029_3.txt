Phantom of the Mall is a movie that fits best in the "easily forgotten" category. This is a nice variation on the famous story by Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. Not a bad idea for himself, but the plot and production of this movie is too poor to bring a decent tribute to the story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux doesn't have to turn into his grave. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and too many boring rows to make it unforgettable. Also, the writing writers wanted to give too much concept to the story as needed. And even though there is a lot of mystery to build on the character of Eric ... the basic plot is plain and dear. *** SPOILERS *** It's about a young couple being ripped apart brutally because the boy is killed in a fire. That fire was set up at his home because he and his parents refused to sell their home to make way for a large shopping mall to be built. The boy survived the fire and he hid himself in the mall to avenge himself. Meanwhile, he watches his girlfriend now working in the mall and tries to forget her loss. **** END SPOILERS *** This beautiful, but slightly effective plot is thickened by many senseless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it's just an entertaining horror movie, try desperately to be an intelligent thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are some innovative murders, but they don't satisfy enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And besides, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least some humor !! This whole production - the role that is included - takes himself too seriously. <br /> <br /> I'll try to end up with some positive aspects ... For example, it is Ken Foree !! The hard horror fans will definitely recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! It is like the horror milestone that has yet to find an equal. Although his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was good to see him again. TV movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, she is a good actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also here, but I can't stand him ... so my opinion about him may be a bit biased. And finally, a little praise for the leading actress, Kari Whitman. She is a very pretty girl and she has a little talent ... too bad, she never made it up. Actually, this movie is her biggest achievement and it says enough about her career ...
