I watched Wright on The Wind with Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone-Robert Stack were terrible - just bloody awful - he had to be a charming jet-setting millionaire - instead he came down like ' a push of the word The plot was stupid and overwhelmed and the 3 "romantic" leaders had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for the best supporting actress - though her camp-sensitive character was boring - thought Splendor's older sister in The Grass was full of anger and bitterness and lacked charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has pushed the entire cast by forced dialogue and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor who played the lead at Get Smart
