Okay, so I'm dead to see this movie. Stoked about the "who's who" in horror country in the movie .... Well, my friend hired it, it brought it over, and we started watching. It's supposed to be a comedy. I didn't even cut once to the 40min point. <br /> <br /> Does this have to do with the budget? On the contrary, there are movies out there, which cost nothing else, and they are incredible (for me anyway). While I watched this movie, I couldn't realize the similarities (ie STEALING) to a low budget in the movie entitled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review about it (it disturbs this movie VAT). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... it had potential it really did. It had the "star power" stolen plot (let the movie behind the scenes of making a movie ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... seriously, it makes me more and more Think about it, ... it could have been really funny. Many jokes fall flat. The acting is good for what it is. But it dragged, was not funny, and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I give it a two because it wasn't SOOO AWFUL, but that's the only reason.
