I really wish that when a comedy was made, people were actually trying to make it funny. It's a movie you can sit with, but nothing special about it. After watching it, you will say it was good. It wasn't boring to watch, but the audience didn't laugh at laughter. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an oh. story. This movie wanted to be Tootsie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 out of 10.
