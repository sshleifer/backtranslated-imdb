Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to finding a bunch of rabbis who find out the Sabbath regulations to reach sabbatical regulations, he does not really attack Judaism and becomes angry when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the state of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to his logical conclusion, he would realize that the creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called "sacred books" of organized religion. This is proof of his complete and total lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> I find it very difficult to believe that the man is atheist or even intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him the "rational" person in the room? In a way, it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends just as stupid as those people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie / documentary about the evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins's "Root of All Evil". This is a brilliantly researched documentary document that clearly sets out what it wants to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, asks no interesting questions or gives it insight into such a controversial subject. It looks as if the robberies and ravages of an old man are dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I almost feel sorry for him.
