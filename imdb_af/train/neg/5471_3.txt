Typical Troma trash, this smutty 80's flick is considered one of the "highlights" of Lloyd Kaufman's infamous production studio, next to "The Toxic Avenger" released one year earlier. "The Poisonous Avenger" is much better if you ask me, but this demented spotter is nonetheless repeatable; Make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town proudly claiming to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and definitely not. The security measures in the local nuclear plant are substandard, to say the least (even Homer Simpson has never been so nonsense) and poisonous waste circles to nearby high school. The first drunken victim is the stereotypical nerd, which starts spraying green stuff from all its body cavities, but is believed to be an accident because it had no less than TWO microwave ovens in its home! Oh, humanity! Shortly afterwards, the core leaks also affected the school's weed planting and started to become really messy. After a party smokes at a party, the cutest couple in the school produce a huge worm sample that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage foam. "Class of Nuke" em High is the horror movie-up-of-the-barrel horror, with such silly dialogues making your ears and makeup effects that make a whole new meaning to the word tasteless. If you like to melt faces, to crush or split in half, it's definitely a must see! Unlike the aforementioned "The Toxic Avenger", this movie is suffering from some really dull and exaggerated moments where nothing really matters, such as when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what is wrong with their hormones. The raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the acting shows are unforgiving amateur. Just go on if you are an avid Troma fanatic.
