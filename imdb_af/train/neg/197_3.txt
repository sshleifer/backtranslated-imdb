While being a great James Arness Western, this film came down as the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy, and it was just untruths to start! Continuity was thrown to the four winds. Anyone catch the gun order? The Mexicans were dumb enough to burn cannons, apparently sticking mud and ramrods out of the tubes. Come on! Then there's Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costs must be gone or something. Or just outside their minds!
