There are really two parts of this movie. Firstly, there is the laughable prologue for the film that is so hysterical and cornball that it almost fittingly feels that 'The Simpsons' Troy McClure has to do the story. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie (starting with a title song that doesn't really fit in with the rest of the movie), technically OK is murdered by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that don't make sense. This is especially true with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who apparently was on the plot and part of the organization all the time, but what would have happened, Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when outbreak ? In that case, he would be a completely redundant and unnecessary character, which he is still in the end. <br /> <br /> The overall problem of the movie is that it is totally unwilling to give any detail about who or what is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to imply that a particular part of society would be able to create such an organization, but rather in the hope that a lack of explanation would be sufficient and the audience form their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Simply, the movie fails at all levels.
