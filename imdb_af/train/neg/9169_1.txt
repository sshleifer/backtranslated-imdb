It gets really bad. The only halfway-saving quality is the effects of the thousands of dots used during the film. There are contextual errors everywhere. The acting is terrible, except Kirk. The story is as big as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself, just kills the movie, if it wasn't already a body. All in all, it's a waste of your life. I would have given it a zero if it were an option on the rating scale.
