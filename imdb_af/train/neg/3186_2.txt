I didn't think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb 'Mitchell', but this one succeeded. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it if you're a fan of Joe Don Baker's much better work. But, if you want to sweat fat guys and really much popular gun battles, you'll love this movie.
