How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone can easily enjoy, I have never seen the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake made with people, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what is the purpose of this movie? But it was also a bit strange that Jim Carrey was Grinch. I mean he is a great comic actor, but he as the Grinch? It just didn't make sense to me. His performance was a little over and unconsciously laughing at moments. Not to mention the added dialogue, was a little childish and not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over and not needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period,. <br /> <br /> Whilst in Whoville, get ready for their best Christmas season, but everything is meant to be perfect. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch who lives above them and that he will not get as good of a Christmas as the other ones. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that he should actually just steal Christmas to show who is about his Christmas version. But soon he realizes that those who may know that this is a bit more than the materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> How the Grinch Chair Christmas wasn't needed and a little over it. I really recommend keeping with the cartoon, just for the simple fact that it's a pretty disturbing version, in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the whole movie was just a little over, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be a cartoon rather than a version with Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
