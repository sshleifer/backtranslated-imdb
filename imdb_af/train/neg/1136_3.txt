Every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you just watched John Ford movies, it looks more dated than when you look at others. ie Grand Hotel is relatively modern melodrama. With Ford there is always the hard sale of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the overstatement of severe badness. Always the poorly crafted, uncomfortable and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a fairly extensive device to deliver sentiment. And sentiment is all that goes for it. <br /> <br /> What Ford does not appreciate for me here is just wondering how the states are ever established by the people of complete morals represented here. . Ford made good movies. It's too dated to be nothing but bad. It feels completely untrue. <br /> <br /> False nose Henry Fonda is bizarre. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the underlying 'S' or 'Shonuff!' Don't say.
