Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse. Michael Hordern is good like Capulet, though it's his usual inclination and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence although he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, first of his "yuk" roles that would make him known. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The sets are nice, if not stunning like some of the other BBC Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is bad too terrible. Rebecca Saire became 15 during the production and has no idea how to act Juliet. She makes her eyes really wide and cuts each line exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly matched to her and his self-respect is inexplicable. The balcony scene runs smoothly and indifferently with no emotional or erotic impact. Their deaths come as a relief. If I had a dagger, I'd have offered it to them earlier. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his fine work in "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand pieces of two or three words each, and then screams the fragments as inextricably and incomprehensibly as possible. In this production abdik Queen Mab. Strange. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakoff, just shows an intermittent gift to put the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening rust is especially incoherent. But there is humor in a later fight, Romeo temporarily nods Tybalt right into the cobblers. Tybalt then grabs the offensive area. But did it come through? <br /> <br /> R&J is a long game. This version is not recommended for the use of classrooms, or more.
