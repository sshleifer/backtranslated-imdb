I expected much better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring predictions for the main series. After the first 30 minutes I waited for it to end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retribution, etc. There are gang members, mafia types, who perform hits. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you helpful advice when viewing movies: As a general rule, if there is excessive over-titration, you know the movie will be a dud. Caprica has a lot of this. The director / writer usually tries to compensate his poor abilities by throwing in some mere bodies. It never works and all that does is the (very) young actresses involved and I feel sorry for them. Directors / authors doing this must be banned from the business. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, rent Caprica. There is (free) porn on the 'Net' if you really want to see mere bodies. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.
