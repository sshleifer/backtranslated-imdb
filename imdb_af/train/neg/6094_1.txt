I am largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. 2) Unless it gets more reviews, it won't be listed in the everyday worst movie list - which it deserves to be 3. I was so happy - I paid five pounds for it. I saw it in stores for 15 pounds. Don't pay so much for this movie! You will be very angry. 4) There are many movies out there in the horror genre that aren't fair to me, and to give this movie a higher score than they are, is criminal <br /> <br /> The plot summary: ' a man with no friends meets a tramp that promises the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone like someone else. Our hero turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on a swing, baby sitting. He kills them one by one until he is found and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? To start with the play is VERY VERY VERY VERY. Someone else compares it to a school production. No, it's worse than any play I've seen at a school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought some of these previously banned movies from the DVD company vipco and wasn't as disappointed as I was. this. Okay, the acting is bad, but the film fails to deliver in every other sense. What was the point of making this movie if there is not even a gore! okay, no gore. What else can a movie like this offer? Breats? No, not even any titillation! <br /> <br /> This is where this movie might have some charm in its unique naffness, but any potential buyer / viewer of this movie should be reasonably advised that this movie is at its best worth it. only one in ten.
