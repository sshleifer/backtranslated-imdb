A movie star Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sound like a good idea. An independent movie sounds even better. The studios will manage less of the content, so the actors and writers and directors can give more creativity. <br /> <br /> But then why is this movie so dirty? Ask the dust. <br /> <br /> This movie is straight from the bat that we invested deeply in the characters. No one gets a proper back story, so we never know why the characters are the way they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you have one at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend I was going to see this movie and I thought it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Her question: "Not even Colin Farrell can save it?" My answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's ass can save it."
