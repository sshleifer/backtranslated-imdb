this movie had a pretty good sounding plot, but the slab was very slow ... very slow indeed. Even if someone thinks it's a cult classic, I think there are much better movies of that era to be watched. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst. The sounds are OK. Lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I would still recommend it to anyone but maybe a film student. <br /> <br /> The movie does not contain music, and the horses have sex. Don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating at the edge of the bed was simply stupid. <br /> <br /> No profits here, skip this total boredom. I saw the worse of my beliefs, but it just wasted time, and I didn't get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings ...
