"The Secretary" is one of those cheesy, cliched, "thrillers" that one is experiencing on a Sunday afternoon when there is virtually nothing else. While the plot (a demented woman envious of everyone who succeeds in getting into the office and deciding to do everything they can to stop them), I can be one of a kind, I recognized countless plot twists , probably from other TV movies I was subjected to for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I wasn't wild about the cast. Mel Harris is one of the actresses that occur in as many TV movies as a "mother" or a kind of "victim" of a dirty play or abuse. It must wonder the kind of life she leads. In this one she gets the pleasure of playing a mother and a victim of psychic secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice than the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves (Singles, Breaking In, and I Think, Law and Order), she's also doing a series of dreary TV roles, and this one just adds it. As for the other, I have no clear memories of them, so it has to say something. <br /> <br /> This one will play on the Lifetime Network (I think that's where I saw it), but don't worry about it unless you're bored for words. Not that it makes you more excited ...
