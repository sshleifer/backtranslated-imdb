I read the back of the box and it was about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful! It'll be great!" I was so wrong. The story is all broken up. In fact, I don't get it yet. It just seems to me that all the characters that were done, drink, smoke (opium?) And had sex. Not that it is not good movie quality, but please! Where was the story? I finished the movie myself and yes, it eventually picked up, but then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want to. Just trust the back of the box.
