The film started out strongly, LL Cool J (Deed) as a sheltered police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from practice, possibly mistaken for a bad man?) Rob and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, setting the conflict of a dirty policeman with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well-cast and the film shows promise. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake (Pollack) launches the movie shortly. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people might see repeatedly, or one who will be teenage girls and see them once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors must work hard at their craft; Timberlake is not talented and no hard work can save him. I would have thought he would make a better performance as he has been talented for years. Everything he did in this movie was inconclusive. <br /> <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums, it doesn't automatically translate them into acting movies. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious shortage of actors. <br /> <br /> There are a few plot holes, such as Pollack's sudden sniper capability and lethal operation of warehouse machinery. This movie had so much promise. Very disappointing.
