Well, what can be said about this disaster? I watched it because it was broadcast on the cable. I'm sorry to waste time, but at least I didn't waste money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the cutest thing you can get! Please, you should be very generous not to get angry with the KOEPS Halloween costume. Oh yes, there are also performances of terrible acting, f / x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you can't get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> It's the worst thing you can get from directly to video movie. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PHOTOS movies like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs, please. The only "positive" thing about this trash is the sexy women.
