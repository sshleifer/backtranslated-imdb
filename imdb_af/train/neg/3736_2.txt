It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams fits in part like a rhino would fit in a tutu, but his performance was still a pity. Kurt Russell was more credible but still terrible. The plot remained a lot to be desired and the rest of the play was terrible. The only thing this movie was about was the trailer that made me waste 90 minutes of my life. It could have been better to lick the head of my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a gun and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy, don't do it.
