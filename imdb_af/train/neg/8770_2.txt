This film was the longest movie and the record film definitely had it. It had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I think no one had any trouble doing that. <br /> <br /> The movie as the title indicates is based on the Kargil War, but the problem is that there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring. There are even too many movies like killing people, wondering which soldier is doing it? <br /> <br /> Direction by JP Dutta poles for BORDER Music is okay <br /> <br /> Under the big cast Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part and also it is his first movie with kareena, Abhishek is like Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna, his share of good rest is past Rani is good, Esha is good, rest is wise
