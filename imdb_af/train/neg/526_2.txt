Almost as annoying as it was to read, evening is an incredible failure. Until Meryl Streep walks in and silently shows her other role players how to act on these things. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role as dying Ann and Claire Danes is a coding. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire played role, we could have seen the vitality of the young Ann who gave her predecessor to the rare world of the story and we could think that the older Ann was actually dead. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would explain the quick storytelling, but unfortunately. It gave me a headache.
