While Leon is nice on SNL, he's just for a moment. Like most SNL skits-to-movies, these 90 minutes can't fill. It has some cute moments (the one you've seen in the trailer), but the actors are mostly wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot doesn't have very high points. Farrell will have a bit of it. Farrell can be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a pity.
