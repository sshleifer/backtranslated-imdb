In addition to his "Tarzan" series, the fertile Edgar Rice Burroughs has written many other books, but, apart from the popular "At the Earth's Core", little of this is filmed. One exception is the novel "The Lad and the Lion", which appears on screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), a portable, static, cute hat, slow-moving and rather dim film, despite being filmed is in true desert places. Actually, "movie" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but moves into a sudden series in a collision. For example, at least five characters get extended opening scenes and then disappear. Even more frustrating for the keen movie lover is the characters that make an impression of all kinds (such as the lass that Saal sits with dried wine), but is enacted by non-credited players! The credited thespians are usually worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good version of the abducted harem girl who saves young masterpiece. Most of the cast is anointed with the horrific King James dialogue to be heard! But the way to play this junk is a tongue-in-the-cheek, a stratagem that doesn't occur to a single one of the movie's grid of non-talented players. Perhaps director J.P. McCarthy sketched the idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the beautiful Kathleen Burke being forced to handle lines like Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (her keeper). Of course, Mr Hall delivers his lines with perhaps more conviction than Mr Carlyle, but it is no recommendation.
