I start with the apology of filmmakers everywhere for the use of the terms "filmmaker", "movie" or "film" in connection with it, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" look a bit harsh. <br /> The writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Directing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The acting: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography: inept for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to set this horror are: WHAT. <br /> <br /> These lots of scrap can hardly be called cinema. The majority of family home movies come closer to the distinction than the Revenge Quest. No, it's just a 10-car video capture. <br /> <br /> We will overshoot the plot in this review because there are too many holes covered at the same time. Let's just say it looks worse than the rest of the movie. Calling the acting one-dimensional will give them credit. What is not there is frightening to start with, and made much worse by the horrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, should be the effects ... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There are no spaces in the guns, no flash points, and what little sound effects existed were either stock "gun" sounds, or it was generated by the mouth (yes, you read it right). The movie maker actually had the audacity to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; I think he feels that they sound more futuristic. It is supposed to be in the year 2031. However, this does not explain the sounds he made through the mouth for fist fights. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality was terrible (he only used the microphone mounted on the video camera and it shows), the use of stockpile sounds was almost worse than at all. use any sounds. The sound effects come from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunk hunt in a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. Imagine: The bad man enters an office building looking for her prey. A lady starts to fear. He raises his gun (a uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not a uzi. The woman walks away from the camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looks like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that my description makes too much justice to the ineffectiveness of the real sequence. <br /> <br /> In a different order, one that is almost - but not really - finds the movie funny enough to look at in a staircase. The bad guy chases the good guy and the woman he protects against the stairs shakes his plastic completely. You may one day There are bad sound effects flying all over the place. <br /> <br /> I thought Alan DeHerrera could not be locked away to understand this train wreck, but he continued to edit and release it. . If there is any justice, there will be a karma there with its name on it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see this bunch of industrial waste and I would strongly recommend it - be sure to watch as the entire screens are almost verbatim lifted by Bladerunner, and the AM radio doubles as a walkie-talkie. Try not to focus too hard on the plot; It will only hurt you more if you do. <br /> <br /> 0 stars of 10. And it's generous.
