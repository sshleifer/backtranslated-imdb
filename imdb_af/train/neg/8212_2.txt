I read all the comments on this movie. I'm a big fan <br /> <br /> of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this <br /> <br /> movie is based. The movie is an ugly and humiliating fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize it for <br /> <br /> to change small details or events for dramatic purposes; it is <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, response, <br /> <br /> realities, and changes in each main character. It changes the <br /> <br /> material relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (who has the <br /> <br /> culture of Tibet) to Harra's music box, to Harrar's change of heart, all about this movie is fake - except <br /> <br /> for great photography. I understand that the shots of the <br /> <br /> Potala (the palace) were smuggled from Tibet. <br /> <br /> One of them very important to this world, to build a <br /> <br>. <br /> <br /> Changing a true story about the relationship between two people. <br /> <br /> movie star is sad
