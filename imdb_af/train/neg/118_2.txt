It is said to be a personal movie for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life, but changed things to fit the characters that fit detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy movie maker than a detective, right? This whole movie was written by Peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You have to write what you know and he did. And let the audience be bored and confused and jealous. It's a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would marry Keith Richards in real life, was also a model, like Stratten, but is much better and has a wider part. In fact, Stratten's part was forced; added. She doesn't have much to do with the story, which is quite complicated. All in all, every character in this movie is someone who can connect very few people to each other unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with stunning supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us it's an annoying snorkelling party. This is what happens when you no longer touch. You entertain your friends with jokes and carry the rest.
