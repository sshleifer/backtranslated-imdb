It was so terrible. It wasn't nice to watch. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator, even it is not nice to watch this movie. Again, the scene where a girl masturbates with a vibrator isn't even fun to watch. Or maybe if it was the only part of the movie you watched, just girl on the couch with a vibrator. Maybe they should just have released that one scene in theaters, maybe the movie will be pleasant at some level. My advice, fast ahead to that point, looks at it, flips the movie back, looks again, rinses, repeats. Maybe you can enjoy this for 2 hours. This movie is spitting on me at your grave and Doom generation in the category of the worst movies I've ever seen.
