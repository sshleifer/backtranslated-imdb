It's one of those movies that you think the makers will refuse to release because it's so terrible. It was clear that they thought children were stupid and great at absorbing endless advertising and would think they were entertained because it was funny. What about the talk engine with buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M's and Skittles? There was no car in the cartoon. (Dr) Claw is supposed to be angry, not attractive and charming. Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems they (Robo Cop) were bad at converting a man into a crime that had a movie. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy. If I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you won't get a refund. I'm sorry I watched that heap of shit over 30 minutes. After receiving the policy of no refund, I decided to see the rest of the garbage dump, Inspector Gadget.
