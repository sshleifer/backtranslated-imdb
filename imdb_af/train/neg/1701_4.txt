David Lynch's rugged and cruel South Park command gives us a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about suburban middle-class families. The father is a rogue monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth hole, the most horrific noise being spoken. The boy and mother are permanently disturbed, inconsiderate creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not known for his comedies (ie On the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I'm not particularly fond of comedies in general. However, there were a few scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some clever pieces of animated cinematography - where Lynch portrays wide range of reactions in his characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really change in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I think Lynch really tried to give his audience a straight forward, as a disturbing, animated comedy here. Interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low brow humor (ie most Will Farrell films), adding elements of evil social criticism and classic cartoon violence and exuberant humor. While the blend doesn't really work well here, it's nothing if it's not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Appreciated by Lynch fans.
