Tarzan the Monkey Man is a remake of the 1932 movie of the same time, and like the previous movie, it has little likeness to Burroughs' literary character. But while the Tarzan of 1932 was saved to Tarzan-Jane's speech, this does not speak Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, or even grin. He does the Tarzan a few times, which seems to have been confronted with the previous movie. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan is playing second banana for Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, as the third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no meaning, but to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the movie are presented in slow motion, and are really bad. More evidence that nobody cares. <br /> <br /> Bitterly, Tarzan has an orangutan sidecar in this movie. Perhaps he has pooled Sumatra car with the Indian elephants that are also being displayed.
