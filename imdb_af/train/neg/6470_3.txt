Disney goes to the well too much, because anyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will be ripped off blatantly. The celebration of the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric is planning to introduce her to King Triton. Ursula's sister Morgana quickly crashes the celebration, intending to use Melody as a defense tool to get the king's threesome. Ariel and Eric build a wall around the sea, while Melody grows up and wonder why she can't go there. <br /> <br /> Strange and horrible that describes it directly to the video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you see seemed to get other Disney movies straight. I think Disney can only plagiarize! Don't tell me that the penguin and walrus don't remind you of another duo of the LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the repetition between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They played terribly below it! The climax between Morgana and EVERYTHING was another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I won't give anything away, but in 75 minutes everything looked nice and too much. An embarrassment to Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better to hire and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other successors. Disney will later drown you.
