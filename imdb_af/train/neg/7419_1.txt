This movie was terrible and an insult to the viewer. Stupid writing, bad decisive, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the traditional tradition of Hollywood, the US government is always angry. The Communist sympathizer tends in Hollywood, most of which is as stupid as a box of rocks, the love of taking lonely nose Eugene McCarthy and illustrating him as the leader of a great movement. The truth is that at the time he was regarded as a cowardly character who exploited a legitimate concern about the Soviet communists for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the US has brought all the evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we wouldn't have a space program. He actually loved being America and became a great asset to the country. <br /> <br /> Yet, the irony is that the foolish Hollywood, an untrained fate of fantasy, still believes the government should run EVERYTHING and give us everything we want. And yet it is the same government that constantly portrays them as a complete evil in movies like this.
