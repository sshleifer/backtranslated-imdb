This film was more effective in convincing me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim. And I am Jewish. <br /> <br /> Are you going to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year's rhetoric? These alarmist allegations, presented in a palatable way, can be persuasive. But by not acknowledging possible contradictory arguments, or viable (or any) solutions, few sources and each of dubious origins, the argument makes an ineffective diatribe. <br /> <br /> And thank you for that - I don't want anyone to leave the theater, any of this racist slap. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a cautionary for you - to really read about a movie before you see it.
