What was the point of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can't act, people don't know how to register, and I'm Kazaam! A genius that raps? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park would be in such a movie. I remember watching it just to kill time. It didn't really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who made Shaq in this movie?" The whole story was also stupid. It makes no sense. I think an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can't comment much more because this movie is so horrible, there's nothing worthy of comment. I wish this movie was gone.
