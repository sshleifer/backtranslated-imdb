Full marks for the content of this movie, as a Briton, I was not aware of in the US fleet segregation took place in WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, direction is not there, the acting is wood and the writing is just one clich√© to the other. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. From the very beginning, to the end, I have put in a very bad way that it is composed. It could have been a good movie, the story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way it is composed. It is a pity that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, was wasted on a low budget, badly directed movie. I just hope that several times in the future one of the big studios will take this theme and do it right.
