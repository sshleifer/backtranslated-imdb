It's hard to believe that people actually like this drink! I think children can enjoy it, but for me it is the kind of childhood movie that parents can't stand. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst child actor of all time. I will give the director the responsibility for the child, but she was really painful to look at. I now feel ashamed of her because people know it's her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound. Then I came here and discovered that they did this because they won Star Search. I've always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade in the name of his wonderful, unhappily missed brother, and this crap shows why. Zero stars.
