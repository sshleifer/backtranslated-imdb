As "Rugrats" have fallen into the good and funny cartoon category in the past three or four years to a mediocre and indeed utterly terrible price for two-year-olds, the Klas-Csupo tyrants must be out of ideas. After I dumped all the characters, I even added stupid new ones, replaced some voices (although I love Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), And has no sense of continuity (for example: in a Kimi episode I watched the other day, Tommy and Chucky each have a new puppy, but the subsequent episode, the aforementioned dogs never occur), you would think the creators could kill the show for grace. But no. <br /> <br /> All I will say about this special is that it sucks! Although not as horrible as the Kimi episodes, everyone is as stupid as they are, including Grandpa (my God! He was the best character on the show, but now he has no real purpose). The end is unnecessarily fluffy, and the only thing that differs between these and other crazy new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can communicate with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> No stars for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please try this view before it gets worse.
