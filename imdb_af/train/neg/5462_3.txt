This program bug me! There is no humor for it and is far too serious to be called "fun"! It's just too educational to my liking! The characters are very stereotyped and unattractive. The plots are redundant and the morals are repeated repeatedly. Where's the fun in it? I also feel it has been on the BBC for too long and is being broadcast too much. Do you really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show comes out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to bring back some of their older shows, such as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually offering contracts at this nuwerwese! I thought the BBC was bringing the danger mouse back, so what's going on ?! 10/03
