Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, how a good director will one day be, etc. I think they're just nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directs this role, shows more talent than she does. "The next Jane Campion," they call her; And, apart from being overestimated, the two have so much in common. They both have direct movies. They are both women. They are both Australian. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yep: this is one of those movies in which a character is considered to be brilliant, and we just have to swallow and accept it. But I'll tell Carruthers: she's cute. And engaging. No really. Here are some thoughts on her lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) A director's talent lies in dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad to get her crew to even take notice of her? To make it easier for everyone to round off and kill the set, I expect. <br /> <br /> Why is this one of the most unconvincing portrayals of a movie set I've ever seen? After all, it must be filmed on a REAL movie set. How can they get it wrong? If Rendall's set was half as much of an understaff, it's a wonder he didn't play his part at all. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - the fiction director - has created herself the task of flicking a brand new 1980's horror. Fat chance. I doubt whether this can be done today. I suspect Rendall - the real and more talented director - has set himself the same task, realizing it can't be done, and being established in the place of (sighing) knowing parody. Of course it is not enough to work a parody as a parody. As soon as the role and the crew foot sat in the secluded house, most of the time the film spent badly doing 1980's horror movies ... well, less bad. <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, and yet ... the film opens with no parody, but an honest-to-goodness pastiche of the 80-year-old horror, starring (this is too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you find yourself watching the movie inside the movie rather than the movie.) Still, it was filmed in the late 1990s. Perhaps it's still possible to make the horror of 1980. You just drop the knowing parody material and mean it. <br /> <br /> (5) I've never wondered what 1980's teenage horror would be if all the characters had Australian accents, but now I know. And strangely, I'm glad I know. A need I never knew I was fulfilled.
