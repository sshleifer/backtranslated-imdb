Who is Bettie Page? I definitely didn't find out while watching this movie. From what I gathered from other sources, I was. Page in the post-war II period highly in demand than the queen of "naughty" photos and that is exactly what this film depicts. I never knew Bettie, the woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian education and a sordid housewife that is just shown. The film shines on her personal life and gets right into the movie's "naughty" photos. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames, but Betty's frame in her fur, Bettie in her belt and socks, Betty in slavery ... etc. The movie moves from black and white to every time me. Page Miami Beach visit. Then we go back to her shades of gray life in New York. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the youngest ladies you could ever meet. When Bettie trusted a friend that she had missed her high school valedictorian by getting an A rather than an A, he could only accept that there were only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how beautiful it is. Page's "naughty" photos in 2007 look. It's really sad that a woman like a pig is seen on a spit, won't even get a hit on My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was badly written or if a crazy editor cut it. I will only recommend it as a source for people studying the history of foreign underwear.
