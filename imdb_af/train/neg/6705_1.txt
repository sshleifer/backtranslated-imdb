This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be a more recognized filmmaking area (such as Vancouver's rise to prominence). The Brothers were shot in Central Florida and this short film is a setback for the area (which made great progress with the Indian film about Africa and the great HBO miniseries from Earth to the moon). <br /> <br /> I'll try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new twist to the 'Boy Band' craze. After all, both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, the brothers are likely to fall because of a poor writing. Both main characters are flat with almost no development (part of which can be the amateur actors, but some are definitely the way the writing is written.) <br /> <br /> A problem is choosing jokes as well. . Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they come out funny for the first time, but it does grow a bit boring). Some of the 'concert' scenes are poorly performed (and many of these scenes also don't seem to move the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I had high expectations for this one, but unfortunately it is a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this card. But I think the best thing for movie maker John Figg is to move to different genres (fast). Comedy is not his strong suit. But it is undeniable that he is definitely one of the more prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that he's now notorious, not known). <br /> <br />
