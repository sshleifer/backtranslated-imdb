I have always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past. This "Byron" presentation was incredible. Incredibly bad! The writing was terrible, the play was uninspired, and all the characters were dissatisfied. Apparently, Byron was "crazy and dangerous to know", and whispered the ladies' hearts. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a jumping little squirt instead of a fiery hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked with a slack. This man's portrayal was just across the board. <br /> <br /> I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to sparkle in life. Not a sputter, not even a glitter. It was absolute tedium, if not straight boredom, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> With the view that no one will ever improve the Bard or Avon, I also believe that Byron's poetry is too much and my mind has to be hit on the back burner, and this dramatization of his life must the same treatment is granted. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC has lost its nose with this one
