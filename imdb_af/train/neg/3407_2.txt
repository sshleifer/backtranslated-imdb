OK, forget about the technical inconsistencies or the physical space shuttle's inaccuracies launched by a strange robot with a heart of gold. Forget about the terribly special effects and poorly built one-dimensional characters. Just look at the foreground of the story. The reason why the movie is in the first place, and you'll just see how bad this movie is nailed. <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-olds who look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is terrible. The acting is comical and the message she tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse is that the cable movie channels KEEP THIS! It's twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone in their right mind think that people want to see this painful piece of celluloid many times, far less to see it at all? <br /> <br /> My response is not even the effort to spend the energy seeing it. It's just not worth it.
