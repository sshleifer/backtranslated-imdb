It had to be a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. It would have been a movie to watch. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a small Falk thrown in. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you almost won't know. I assume Reiser is under the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle. He's not. Even more so, Reiser has taken the trouble to hire some of the best female character rides on the screen today and when they were all in the background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen glows. The story is really about Falk and Dukakis, but we are subject to a senseless, stupid, deadly road trip in which Reiser shows how cute, precious and o-so-deep with psychological insight (wrong!) He can be. For example, in a restaurant scene I think Reiser hoped he was "Cassavetes-like", there is a legally false confrontation between Reiser and Falk, who apparently is ridiculous. I was embarrassed by Falk.
