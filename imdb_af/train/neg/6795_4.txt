The return begins promising, with a brutal image of a dead man wearing a murderer mask. The mask itself is also quite cool, and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990's movie "Grandma". From then on, the movie is mostly boring. We still get some deaths, which are good again, but there aren't enough of them. The reason why the deaths are so good is because they are indignant and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and would have worked very well if it wasn't so boring. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a heavy collector, I will avoid it - there is not enough here to make it even an average player.
