Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about the sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated feature with everything of top quality, great music score, and target for a general audience. In contrast, the Little Mermaid 2 is mainly aimed at young children, as it is spontaneous, reflecting the child's own perspective, the music is bouncier and less dramatic and the end feels like recess. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 starts when baby Melody is presented to Ariel's side of the family. Suddenly, without any visual cues to help the drama, grab a huge tentacle to the baby. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not funny, the baby is attacked! All right, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity, take away the potential drama, because it happened so fast. <br /> <br /> Melody looks superhuman everywhere, which I defend is how most children see themselves. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought to an end when she fights Morgana without a thumb fear on her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Melody has many Ariel's problems, except the reverse. Queen Ariel seems to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean, while King Triton Ariel limited the surface. Ariel and Melodie rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> The music moves more emotionally in the first. This successor has a lot of songs, but not so much orchestral work has succeeded. It's great for little ones, because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end in the first movie was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a jumping song and everyone plays in the water. It's definitely more aimed at kids, because instead of the end being solemn and letting you blow away, let this end think you: "It's time for recess!" Eventually, this movie is fun for kids, so we need to have fun.
