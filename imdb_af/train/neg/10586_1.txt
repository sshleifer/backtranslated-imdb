It is a well-informed film in the bait of PBS Frontline. The problem is, Frontline has already done this piece and succeeded in bringing in L. Paul Bremer to tell his side of the story. More disturbing is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - a former thinker, wonk, was a war support until the occupation became south. What did he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland also went very well until it was wasted by the awkward Nazis. And that is what this film feels - an excuse for career rather than a deconstruction of war itself. <br /> <br /> Ferguson suggests that the war could improve - as if any war could be better.
