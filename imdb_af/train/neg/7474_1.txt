This program didn't do it for me, though I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there wasn't a single scene that wasn't dominated by the main character. It made it a little two-dimensional and I gave up before the program was over. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there as I am not a film critic, but the guidelines on IMDb suggest you have to comment 10 lines. This reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every stage, and I hope the authors of this program can use more diversity to engage with the viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any of the role-players, and it is just that I looked at things like the "thread" and I expected great things from cop drama.
