This movie was a long build up without climax. People who ultimately refer to such a struggle must also be out of their minds or have nothing. All too often, this movie has become soft. I'm not saying soft movies are bad. But no matter how much you love sugar, it should have no space on a T-bone steak. This movie would be vengeance for crimes committed against a culture, but it was ultimately a small bar bailer. And there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was; Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays well). Rob Roy was a poor "hero" without knowing how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a shame. As a drama, this movie had time, but the best performance in it should be Scotland's. It's a touch of short breath called in my book as "soap".
