I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick, but it's just bad. And not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3K. It's just misleading as if you can't enjoy anything about it, no matter how hard you try. I really regret 2 hours of precious life on this shit. You can see by seeing that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew that this movie would just bury their careers. Apparently "Walking Tall" got enough revenue that someone decided they could make their investment. If it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad it has gotten the worst movies out of my memory.
