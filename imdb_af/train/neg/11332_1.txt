As big as a Texas prairie and just as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can't drive this overblown boat. Taylor looks really bad - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair and wrong make-up - a unique achievement in her remarkable career. Hopper gives the only credible performance, and Dean in the climax shows striking talent as something we don't usually remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a say, Redford could have done to the male head. There is no observable plot that offers any tension to the final twenty minutes, just a sticker of milestones that have little relationship with each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, just a collection of cardboard cuttings that occasionally appear in a shooting gallery for no distinctive reason such as random targets. The film highlights racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it has SIZE, which makes it an excellent choice to snatch yourself from unwelcome guests. Those with the DVD version can save themselves by starting from the second disc. You won't be of interest.
