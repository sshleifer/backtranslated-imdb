I wanted to stamp the TV. To see this was torture. I hated it. Never see this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is irritating. I usually like him, but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most annoying movie in the world. The comedian he is jealous of is stupid. The only funniest part is the tumbler with the black teeth that all the girls get. It was so annoying that I wanted to stamp the TV. Don't buy this movie unless you want to recognize someone. If you even buy Adam Sandler like a little, don't buy it. It will just hate you. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, put it away to put everyone at risk of buying it. It's a $ 1.99 wastage I paid for it.
