The beautiful Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushed her before the "I's" with fiance Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years Henry still has to move and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe arranges for Henry to speak to an attractive psychologist Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley is contacting Kate's spirit, hoping Henry will help with his life. When the psychologist begins to dress, it is attracted to Henry. Kate's spirit seems to cut the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you saw the trailers, you saw the contents of the movie. Also in the movie: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought Bell stole Parker's show. And Biggs as a pain in the buttocks. Yet this movie is overheated.
