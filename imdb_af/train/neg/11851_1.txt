It was a disappointment - nothing of the nuance of the original. The Brits just seem to make a really disturbing movie with none of the over-the-top features of the American version. The original series combined both scary stories and subtle performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I watched the series many times and am still surprised. <br /> <br /> Just another bad adaptation according to the terrible adaptation of Cracker. Get addicted to BBC America or BBC Canada and look for such sweets as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness, and Judge John Deed. Look at the original Touching Evil, then look for "Wire in the Blood" for more of the truly understated, elegant performance of Robson Green. Hollywood must have a look at this actor!
