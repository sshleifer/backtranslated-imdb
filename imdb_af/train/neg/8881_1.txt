The character character is a bit stiff, as if it were the first actors to act on the screen. Unfortunately one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (many roles on TV, such as Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night) dies quickly and her acting misses can be missed. <br /> <br /> The lead role is Mr. Ballard, as depicted by Cliff Robertson. Cliff was forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. He does not do a bad job, but it is a bit too much to ask an actor to connect the oceans to the empty screen time, during which the characters spend their time, not talking and also NOT acting. Robertson's most memorable role might be Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (with leading Tobey Maguire). The plot is predictable. A man killed his rich wife for her money. then the woman looks back and the man haunts him insane until he jumps from a tall window (fear the ghost of his dead wife approaching him), on the day he is predicted not to die any less. <br /> <br /> The second driver, Mr. Ballard rentals look very much like an English brand Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is the extreme disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in silence, no one speaks, and little action. It's a pity that the MST3K men never got this movie. It could have been much better, if not just as predictable, with more dialogue or shorter scenes of 'nothing'. <br /> <br /> I was expecting G'Mork's red eyes to come out of the shadows and declaring that he was working for the "nothing" in this movie.
