I watched an episode. Yes, I went through the whole unfortunate experience, and I have to say, this branded comedy is one of the worst things you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, of Family Guy fame. Now think of Peter Griffin as a (albeit slender and minus the glasses) woman, except he misses the thing that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he is an idiot. Sarah has none of the true character, nothing of the acting ability to draw her character. Maybe it's the brave, formal jokes that make her comedy even lower than her character can take it herself. Maybe it's the lack of credible films. Her insensitive, excited persona can appeal to insensitive, sensible people, unlike the mass appeal that Stephen Colbert's insensitive, distorted character has. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfriendly character. She doesn't need anything needed for the satire genre, let alone the whole world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks is its noticeable. And if you don't believe it and identify with it, it's no longer funny.
