A surprising freak of the usually trusted Larry Cohen (God told me, Q, etc.), Full Moon High, tries so hard to be funny and fails, even with decent turn by Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars . Alan Arkin looks ashamed of his performance and son Adam looks simply numb. It makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.
