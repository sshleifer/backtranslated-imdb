Let's get it out of the way. . . Yes, this movie steals a lot of 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The plot for 'Darkness Falls' goes like this: The Tandfee, a murderous woman who hides her face for dismay, kills people who look at her from revenge. In the 'Tooth Fairy' (2006), the furious tooth festival (which, yes, conceals her face) is released her rage of revenge on just about everyone. A bit too similar to coincidence. <br /> <br /> But what should be asked is: If you steal the exact plot of a movie, why choose something as mediocre as "Darkness Falls"? Certainly it made a few bucks at the box, but it was strict for the pretty good theater experience the movie delivered. A low budget, straight-to-video movie won't have the same effect. And it didn't. <br /> <br /> When I watched the opening of 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations actually rose. There was almost SOME production value. The story does not look terrible, just rattled. Beyond the first scene we get a good movie, including a former doctor with secrets (played by the guy who looks like a Busey) and a hot veterinary student (Jenifer of Argento's Masters of Horror: Jenifer). However, after a few minutes, the film slowly slows down. It serves all the basic horrible cliches, including but not limited to: a crazy old parent with an intrepid warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems this movie had was the inability to keep a target audience. It's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on the screen. When the adults were on the screen, it had a more mature feel. When Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on the screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, immature, immature level. When the child was on the screen, it felt like an episode of "Are You Scared of the Dark?" . . just as scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is all over the place. The visuals range from pretty good to boring boring. The writing is subtle, like the acting for the most part. On the positive side, there are a few excessive gores in parts (including a fairly cool (but painfully predictable)) wood-screen scene and a pretty evil nailgun scene. Also, if you're looking for some of the sexy stuff, there's a short topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better movies to do that). Other than that, there's not much to bother when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of 'Darkness Falls' (does it exist?), maybe you can look to see the story differently. . . but it's about the only reason I can find this one. Final ruling: 3/10 -AP3-
