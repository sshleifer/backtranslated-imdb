I had a very difficult time making it through this move. It was extremely slow and sometimes wondered when the plot of the movie would come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie looked like it was slow, and I continued to wonder when it was going to end. I am usually a person who keeps a good indie file every time, but it doesn't meet what I'm looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed like they were trying to make too much of this movie. At one point it was to change politics, because I'm not a big fan of movies. If you're looking for a slow moving movie with little or no plot then it's the right movie for you. As far as I am concerned, I felt I was wasting 2 hours when I could do something else.
