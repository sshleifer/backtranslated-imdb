I have to get myself on the back to watch this movie completely because it was really painful. An incompetent painter becomes a full-fledged hit? This movie was full of absurdities I would call everyone, I would give away the movie. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt should really be in a screen to agree to do this movie. The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. As a healthy and sensible individual, I couldn't understand where the writer came from or where he went with this movie. There was indifference to every main character, there was a string of fearless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. An absurd action after another with a dialogue does not make a movie, it just makes a talkative train wreck.
