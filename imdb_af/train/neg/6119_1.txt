Muscular man monkey in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; the lucky daughter of the team's leader finds him first. Very-ballyhooed version of the Tarzan story has an OK production, but is paralyzed by the one-handed worst direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek has been inspired by grim slow-motion action shots and gaze-a-boo glimpses of Bo Derek's unspecified body; He has about as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. To try to get sexuality in the cheek, the Dereks do not have finesse, funny timing and taste. They have a sense of self-esteem and bravura abandonment (they give caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who has had all the marbles in his mouth all the time) has the title role, but plays the third role of John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's sense of self-interest. * of ****
