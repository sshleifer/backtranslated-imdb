I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman - I loved Evolution and what didn't Ghostbusters like? You know from the trailer that Uma's character is being dumped by Luke. So the build-up is obviously the moment she releases her superpowers. But the installment is just not there. The shark threw managed to get a (slight) giggle, but again, it was all in the trailer. <br /> <br /> Nobody's amazing like Uma and Luke is Owen's diet on his good days. If you didn't sit for Riann Wilson, you would sit there. with a stubborn smile until your cheeks start cramping. It's a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible - it's just like an old cracker behind the fridge. It could be such a brilliant broadcast of Superhero movies and feminism, but failed on both points. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
