Kirstie Alley, who looks a bit slimmer, but just a little, is in this mess with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike, bleached blonde hair and everyone. The movie is about an older woman (50 !!!) who can't get her script due to age discrimination, so she sends in her younger cousin to introduce as a writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie, with a dormant play, a foolish dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot about a writer with a love or admiration for Kirstie's character and why it is included is a mystery. The actor portraying Kirstie's brother is so timid and displeased, it is torture to watch their scenes. What to say about this movie. Avoid it.
