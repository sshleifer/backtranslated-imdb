Wow this movie sucks big time. I heard this movie expressing the meaning of friendship very well. And with all the internet hype on this movie I figured out what could go wrong? However, the movie was just bad. It was boring and the character development was never there. Space travelers were also a terrible movie, if you didn't like that movie, there was no way you would like that.
