The first movie is pretty good. This one is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recycle many footage (including the opening credits and end title) of Criminal Insane. The new footage, shot at video, is really pushing badly. Scenes don't have proper lighting, sometimes the sound is almost inaudible, even video glitches like the movie and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad followers, basically repeat the story of the first one. Ethel is killing everyone who shares her home, often for reasons to do with them, in the way of food they want. <br /> <br /> At least it's just an extra on the DVD for the first one which also includes the same director's movie Satan's black wedding. Too bad does not include the Death Nurse movies.
