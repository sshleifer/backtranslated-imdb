Was there a single positive on this movie? Critics who knew nothing of video games could mark the chosen spelling errors. No damage due to obviously visible damage is a primary example. <br /> <br /> And I may have missed something but was not Super Mario Bros. 3 supposed to be a game that has never played before? Well, if that's the case, and I didn't miss anything ... how did Fred Savage's character, and even the girl, know so much about the game? We talk about things some people don't know by playing their second or third. <br /> <br /> Besides the factual and spelling mistakes, there is the general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is frankly unforgettable. The child was not even happy to play video games in the footage they showed. Many children I knew in those days were much more experienced. What's more, the play and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are vague and completely uninteresting. The "Wizard" (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry child's cleft of a small child who hardly ever speaks because of a trauma. It's not that it's unrealistic, it's the fact that it has to be thrown into the movie to actually even start a plot that even exceeds 30 minutes. Honestly, the only value to be found here is of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you would like it to be good or not good. It's about children playing video games, and when you saw it, you probably also had an obsession with the NES. But if you did not love it as a child, it is just nothing that interests you, and very little that prevents you from eliminating it. <br /> <br /> No sir, I didn't like it. .
