Absence of a good plot, absence of proper application, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of proper search SPECIAL EFFECTS ... should I continue? Overview may contain SPOILERS. The actors seem to read their lines, and not very well with them. Most of the "actors" acted like they were in a second degree. The story seems to have been written by one of the above-mentioned second-riders ... it's not really all that collapsed. It's just as simple and stupid that a person thinks they should miss something so they think it's over. No, it's not, it's just as simple as you think it is. I UNDERSTAND the "movie", so I know it's bumping! Mostly of the movie people just sat talking (reading their lines), trying to look sinister. The narrator was ANNOYING. The "special effects" were LOW. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore. Just not in this movie ... You can say they are not paid or not paid much because their hearts were not their talents in it either. I love Tony Todd ... but he was just adequate in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was just there for a whole TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I suggest the DVD to progress to the two-minute Tony Todd segment. If I went to the theater and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this "movie", I would have been P.O. and claimed my money back. Hopefully the people who made it will do better next time.
