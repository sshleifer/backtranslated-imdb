They looked at me in school and it was terrible. The movie is out of date. The episodes become confusing because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers spoke it as a treatise, but it really was a painful boring experience. I have read that very few people appear to be actress, but most of them do what they do in the real-life film. It is very important that cheesy perform regularly. Also, many times the story is gently shameful and far-fetched. I don't like the way some lines are written and wish they had more meaning for them. Although it was written to be educational, funny, exciting and hip, it eventually became boring, dry, rushed and old. I hope nobody takes time to watch this movie, because you just won't be good at seeing it.
