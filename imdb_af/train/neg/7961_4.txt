Five years after the original Creepshow, another inferior horror successor is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time, there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or different. The first story is a horror stacking, a formal story about a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the murderers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly shop owners. The second story, "The Raft", is a story by Stephen King. It's about four teenagers who unconsciously spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the children are shouting for their lives, as a watery blob holds them for no apparent reason. Instead of being tense, however, the children are anointed with a bad dialogue and watchful behavior, which prevents us from really caring about what happens next. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker", which is actually a readjustment to Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film-noir tension. Then it was adapted to a well-known Twilight Zone episode with Inger Stevens. "The Hitch hiker" works best from these three offers, but it is not without its problems. Lois Chiles plays a fraudulent spouse, who eventually runs over a hitch hiker, or so she thinks. However, we do not know if we want to sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many similar stories of this type, the characters only exist to tell the stories with their twists. The wrap around the story with the bulls looks a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as the "crawl" in this installment. The good thing is that there are no more successors. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
