A friend once told me that an artist-independent movie ran into a theater when the film was closed. The audience was so furious that they had preceded tearing the cinemas. Of course, my imagination ran crazy and tried to call up the content of such a piece of work. Well, now my imagination can be brought to rest. <br /> <br /> I'm a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and a passionate fan of his work. I came across many people who thought Tarkovsky's films were moving slowly and inert. What they are, I have found, is not true of the then directors' wonderful works of meaning, beautiful compositions, and complex philosophical questions. At the trial of Alexander Sokurov, called Tarkovsky's heir, I was excited to experience his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the open air travel through the states (Stalker), this film has no relation to anything Tarkovsky has. done. It doesn't seem to have the least significance, even on a completely bad level. It is thought to be "gorgeously strong" cinematography without any compositional craft. There is no balance, no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to be lower on batteries in the freezing snow. The main character is so unclear and undecided. It makes you wonder if his father might have been alive if he had planned earlier. <br /> <br /> I'm also not detrimental to non-sudden or story lines that progress in multiple non-linear ways. But there's not even a non-story here. One must surely enter the performance of this movie with a shaved head if one does not get it and does not lose anything, as hair can be the only possible answer to a rate that can leave a Tarkosky image of time Looks like Jerry Bruckheimer filmed a short Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I won't rule out being one of Sokurov's stinkers (Tarkovsky's Solaris), but conclude that he's one of Tarkovsky's heirs based on this movie. - would be to call Paris Hilton the successor of Aristotle. Come on guys, don't be afraid to say it. No amount of great impressive words will bring this body of celluloid back into life. I do not fully understand Russian culture and I probably do not have Russian values, but I immediately took up Tarkovsky's work as something magical, a treasure and a gift to viewers. <br /> <br /> If it didn't have Sokurov's name on it, it broadcast on Saturday Night Live. I'm pretty sure no one will read all this beautiful analysis in this wet nipple of a movie.
