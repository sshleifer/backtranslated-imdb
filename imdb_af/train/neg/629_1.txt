I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies, are so good they are good. A wise cracking ninja scarecrow that can implement grain sheaths as lethal weapons ... fit this 'budget to shine' system. The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and it turns and turns it on. To keep the audience at the edge of their seats, really drives the creepy ... ninja ... puberty-stricken ... before thirty-year-old student ... non-cowboy drawing ... edit-crack ... boy -of-the-bitch scarecrow in the limestone as the year's creepiest horror icon. All I can really say is, "Can you dig it up and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy this kind of hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT'S THE HELL?)
