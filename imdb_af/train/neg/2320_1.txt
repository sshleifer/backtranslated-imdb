This film was made for the Asian / Chinese market, especially aimed at fans of Jay Chou, one of the greatest music star in Asian. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a talented songwriter / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he has appeared in several major budget productions ("initial D", "golden flower curse"). He has won incredibly both gold horses (Taiwan) and Hong Kong "initial D" awards. <br /> <br /> The supportive role has been chosen very well, which actually claims everyone from China. The film includes many famous films / TV actors, singers, even sports commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they did not have enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu has taken over both director and author position. He has a reputation for making level and brainless films based on non-coherent scripts. With his poor directing and song story, the talented role-players, fancy vision effects and sounds of production means have been wasted. <br /> <br /> The terrible movie, however, successfully completed more than $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asian, making this one of the biggest box office successes in Asia. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: you can only watch this movie if you want to see how money and talents are wasted, or if you are simply supporting your kids who are fans of Jay Chou.
