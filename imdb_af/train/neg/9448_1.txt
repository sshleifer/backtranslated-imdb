No redeeming features, this movie is junk. His jokes are not funny. The humor for kids is pathetic, and the efforts to appeal to adults just add a tough look to the whole unfortunate package. By putting my children in, I made myself uncomfortable about what could come next. I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. Although my child who bought the DVD enjoys the fact that she owns a new DVD, she and her sisters did not have much interest in seeing it again, unlike Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King. get regular requests for replays.
