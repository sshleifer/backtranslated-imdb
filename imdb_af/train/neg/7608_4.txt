I will admit that I don't expect much from a Roger Corman movie. In general, I expect many running and bad scripts. But in this case I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the mocking Beverly Garland) taken over as a sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Me. Garland is a pretty good shot herself, and the next day, one of the killers was killed during her husband's funeral. Her first task is to shut down the local pub that violates the town hall. The bar's owner tries to buy land in anticipation of being sold out by the (hop-for) railway. But Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the barrister hires a man for her. Garland to kill. <br /> <br /> Because of me. Garland plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation. To go to Suzanne Somers "She's the Sheriff" jokes. With the exception of a few faux pas (the apartment door that opens from inside, the jeep tracks, and the two riders waiting on the screen to drive their way around a corner), the movie becomes quite acceptable as a movie fare. However, Corman couldn't resist filling his horse-riding movie, just as he did in other movies. <br /> <br /> Sterno says The Gunslinger is a perdopera worth your time.
