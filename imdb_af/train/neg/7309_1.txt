I rented this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed something wrong with this movie; It's awful! I mean, in the trailers, it looked terrible and serious! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, that's funny ...? TRAFFIC!) He must watch and learn about better horror comedies such as: "Scary Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! It's funny! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is why I registered at www.IMDb.com, so I can leave my thoughts of dissatisfaction on it. <br /> <br /> I've decided to watch the movie a second time> AAARGH! <and make notes for my partial "review" to show how foolish the movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's my car?" (comedy) I can watch over and over and enjoy! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and director be ??? It's bad. Here are the horrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog is lying on the ground with his tongue hanging from his mouth and the dead-glazed star is dead! <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the forest?") is "nothing". The writer warned that bearded guy for the bush just for a thrill. <br /> <br /> Then give the "smartest" of the 5 pack, Bert, almost an example of how to start a forest fire. . He now meets infected Henry who asks for help and from here the movie wants to break the record using the "F word". Bert starts freaking out because Henry looks very sick. Bert: "Don't let me shoot you!" (he forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") Bert goes back to the cabin, but how are you? He met Marcy and Jeff who had sex, but suddenly decided to go for a walk! Marcy shows off the unguarded campfire. Bert started earlier (a moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry, because the fool thinks he killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another stranger appears with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning is about. It is full of weirdos ... and their dogs!?) They just let him sit with them because he has a large bag of cannabis. (Their brain is completely drunk! No wonder why they are so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgotten character! Live! <br /> <br /> Henry appears at their cabin, (PLEASE NOTE: He has been lying a few meters from their cabin !!!) Look worse, almost like a zombie, cover in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck, which of course also has the key to ignition. Henry looks almost clever enough to drive hell out of there, but begins to make blood over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five comes out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* have I ever tried to play baseball in the middle of the forest ???), a poker and n (insecticide? can, ready to fight the single, unarmed and terribly ill man. (clever writing!) Bert drives the car with one shot of his BB Gun, which is possible only in the minds of director Eli Roth. "What do I still have to do?" Bert shouted in his defense. Jeff and Paul tried Henry with their bat and poker discount, but missed the truck's windows instead. Henry walked up to the stupid girls who said, "He comes to please! "(Thank you for the information, stupid brothers, I can see! But I don't think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy squirts in his eyes and makes Henry sorry! And our" hero "touches Henry's arm with A burning log out of the campfire that left them recklessly while inside the cabin! (Where has that wisdom gone? I think the cannabis has taken its toll! :-) Henry gets into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff, head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to help herself in the bush, because Paul stays behind Karen. Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert had already gone for help! <br /> <br /> I now comment on how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE row over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she is going? Anyway, she goes to the river and finds a very large and seemingly deserted cabin and, as in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin and says, "Hello? Is there anyone there?" Bert suddenly appears from behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and I first). And then Jeff also comes. How did they come here? Did they swim across the river? Do you see how brainless the writing is? <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow didn't notice the blood on their truck. It takes about 35 minutes of viewing and I decided to stop torturing and expressing the DVD. (Before I watch my own eyes!) Now, it's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, do yourself a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys", or " The Return of the Living Dead ". Then you will see that they are more entertaining than this ... thing. Even the "Toxic Avenger part 2", which is also a bad movie, is much more funny than "Cabin Fever".
