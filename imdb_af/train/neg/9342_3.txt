Completion of the 1929-30 all-talkie Our Gang release schedule, A Tough Winter, contains two story lines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, alone on a winter day, decide to make a coffee. Little Wheezer turns off the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking program. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the gang dress up - and eventually get it across the house! <br /> <br /> The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor's gangster, and his interactions with the gang. <br /> <br /> "A Hard Winter," I have never shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization that shows an oblique, cunning and slow-moving character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "skilled comic" and used this "Our Gang" access as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, explaining why the film was laid. <br /> <br /> While there are a few funny moments with Fetchit and the Taffy, a Tough Winter is a looting and winding effort. When one positive came from this film, the Hal Roach studios were confident and experienced in making talks. The sound in the movie is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film has partly paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 "Our Gang" films. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
