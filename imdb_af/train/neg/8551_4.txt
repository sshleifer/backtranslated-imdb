It was 1982, two years after the Iranian Embassy engagement involving the dramatic SAS rescue of the Balconys, and with a war with Argentina on the Falkland Islands that are currently taking place, which better movie than a Gung-Ho "SAS" movie - Iranian hostage siege while using Britains number one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. throw Edward Woodward and some other famous actors and you have a winner on your hands? ... Well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the play is quite two-digit. It's like a movie-long episode of "The Professionals" but without the formula. This film doesn't go anywhere fast and is pretty predictable. Perhaps Cubby Brocoli watched this movie and decided to demolish Lewis Collins as a James Bond replacement for Roger Moore. If you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in general, if not, save your time.
