Jet Li is one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the world. He's been around for over 20 years and he shamed others in the genre. While large in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be an outbreak movie for him, but it fails terribly. First, it is called. Although it may have camp value (the dubbing is not even close and it is flat in tone), it seems inappropriate for the regular movie viewer. Secondly, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, sometimes you don't know what's going on. Other times the camera shakes and blows. Fans see Jet Li's films for the fantastic martial arts. The director shows the screens so fast that you don't even know who is half the time! Other times, a scene is being held on the slope (that is, Li begins to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the bad lions are arming their guns, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under Other scenes are so unlikely that they are about to be completely ridiculous (killer CD roms? Just give him Gooies!). Li needs a director less likely to machine gun and more to create a movie-like mise-a-scene. The additional rap / techno music goes from okay to intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but is all destroyed by character-like characters that take away any credibility that this movie aspires to. And are we really to believe that the love interest won't recognize Simon, because he has a half mask on it? Wouldn't the hair, lower jaw or voice give it away? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin Temple. This apostate mess is a total waste of time ... 2/10
