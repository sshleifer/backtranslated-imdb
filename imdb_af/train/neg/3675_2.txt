Really, everyone in this movie looks like they want to be different! No wonder, the casting is not done with the left hand, but not at all. I have seen nothing worse than Natascha McElhone who is a sort of agent carrying a gun. You don't use a spoiled city-brat look in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is throwing Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also terrible, possibly with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. Oh, did I mention it's a completely insane story? Domination of many people lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the man (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography can be worse.
