I bet you, Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore have agreed in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear. Isn't it just for Gene to switch to the ladies' team and then throw him on his sword? And Big Pussy? What hell was, "look at me, I'm a mess!" double episode crap? All that clich√© mafia banter-kom! The big names voted just happened if they had already received money for their charity and had a customized outlet. Hmm ... It's not reality, but drama! Mark Burnett's other performance, "Survivor," also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay left his room when he had just had a short time before his child was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
