I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongolian, which is absolutely fantastic, and which I highly recommended, I had high expectations of a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I waited for something exciting to happen, but that didn't happen, then I expected a huge epic battle, but it was even a great disappointment, just a few random runs, with the swords ... There are so many good warrior movies, this one is not one of them.
