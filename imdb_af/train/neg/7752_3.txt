The movie is about a sabretooth on the loss at an amusement park where teens hunt on a hunter. Since there are no rules, they break into a building and start killing. The deaths are cheesy and stupid. But at least it had better effects than sabretooth. I gave it a try because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was good, but some deaths were outside the screen. There was a stupid scene where the two teenagers kissed and the sabretooth's head jumped out and the boy left his girlfriend behind her to see her completely fake red guts. Then the sabretooth stands up in the vents and bites the children away. The end with the owner was completely fake search graphics. Even that death was silly because the images of the tooth went through his mouth and hung there as it would support and there is a scene when a girl loses her contacts, they do not find and looks like she is not. The movie is idiotic and a waste of time.
