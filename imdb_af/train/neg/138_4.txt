The Good: I love this movie because it was the first horror movie I have ever seen that really scared me. The play was not bad, and the Cupid killer was credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There just wasn't much about it. The ways in which the murderer killed his victims were very terrible and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who cannot handle everything. <br /> <br /> Overall: A good scare but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
