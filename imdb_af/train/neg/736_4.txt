Twenty years ago, five-year-old son, Michael Hawthorne, testified that his father killed an ax in an empty road and later committed suicide. Michael (Gordon Currie) today invites his friend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest inner fear, and with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an old Indian celebration using the carved wooden house Morty (Jon Fedele) as fears would end forever. The biggest fear for Michael is to become a serial killer like his dad, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father and kills his friends. <br /> <br /> "The Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and useless move film that uses the interesting concept to eliminate every friend's greatest inner fear before it grows, but in a messy script full kliches. There are some exaggerated performances, such as me. Betsy Palmer; Others very poor, but overall the play is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to life; Furthermore, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sad when each of them dies. The low rate over fifty minutes could have been to build a better dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows a charm that his father is interested in not having noticed behind the story. I don't know if the previous reference in the DVD released in Brazil was 87 minutes running. The special effects are very reasonable for a B movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite the Halloween" ("Fear 2: A Night of Halloween")
