The biggest secret of Veronica Mars is not one she had to tackle on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, the mystery is why this eternal rating of disappointment is still on the air. This week was a nadir for Veronica Mars: it was 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read right. Veronica Mars is beaten by every show of the newly created WB and every show on UPN. It's hit by all the shows on Fox and, of course, by all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now, the hyphypers are going to say: but it was a repeat. But everything on TV that week was almost a repetition! This leaves the idea why CW would choose this qualified disappointment, as one of the few shows saved it from UPN. <br /> <br /> Obviously something is happening behind the scenes. Favorites are exchanged and influenced peddled. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The "Veronica Mars has potential" line is clearly dead now that it had two years to settle and fail. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's Joel Silver's influence and influence, but honestly, I have a loss why someone would choose to spend their complaints on a bad performance that no audience sees. <br /> <br /> A great mystery and a very unpleasant debut for CW.
