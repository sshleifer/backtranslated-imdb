Since I was eight, I was a great wrestler. It doesn't matter which federation I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, the action is all that I have looked at. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. This was my 19th birthday. I ordered over the edge and I only expected another pay per view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, the night was one of the best wrestlers to come from Canada, a real man fell to his death because of a stunt that went wrong. Not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened. Owens's death made me very angry. <br /> <br /> Instead, pay per eye ends and does the right thing as people. The WWE decided to protect what came first and that was the money the pay per show went as if Owens death never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but it was by far the stupidest decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And this crap to say Owen would want the payroll to stay out of sight. Give me a chance. If somebody dies on a bank, his comon sees it to stop it. It's like a police officer who shot a robber or a killer for a while and then just left the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the men's life never mattered do not have. <br /> <br /> But no matter what happens. Owen will be missed and thank you for the memories for all the times you gave us.
