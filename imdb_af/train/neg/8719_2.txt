Well, here I go with another B business click. It's sad enough to see bad movies, but I don't care whether a B-industry or C-industry is delivering the movie. Shows some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. The acting is not in this one (surprise), but is plot. How can a tough team testify to two of their co-soldiers slaughtered, and then continue as if nothing happened. What made me sick was how the writer even threw the remaining members into a scene joking about how nice the doctor's ass is. Give me a chance.
