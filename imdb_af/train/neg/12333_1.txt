Un-bleeping-believable! Meg Ryan doesn't even look at her usual, lovely self in this, which usually forgives me for her shallow, fun-filled sktick. Hard to believe she was the producer on this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide journey has his career taken? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally, is it directed by the man who did Big Chill? Must be a repeat of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
