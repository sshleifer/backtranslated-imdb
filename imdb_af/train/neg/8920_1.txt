... but it must be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And it takes a bit to do, with different life efforts. Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I enjoyed her in other roles (for example, look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes). But the writing gives her no option, but to chew the landscape. And chew what she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim going into a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me the classic time at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception, perhaps, of Scrooged, all others are just overarching efforts to understand the past, present or future Christmas Spirit.
