METAMORPHOSE I work through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Metamorphosis emerged in 1990 as a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire", which also appears as a scientist seeking similar results. In modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. <br /> <br /> A university researcher works to crack the human genome to create a serum that can prevent aging. Printed by the administration to publish his papers; And, if you deliver a few trials (or lose risks), the scientist decides to use himself as a taster! Initially, he thought he had no adverse side effects, and eventually he discovered that the serum had changed in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The play is styled; and the performances left me with a considerable interest in the film. The score is pandering. And the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only deceptive; this is absurd; It's ridiculous ?? at its best. <br /> <br /> As others have noticed, the end is in a 30+ minute gag, which seems to be endless. Without giving away too much, I will call this one, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde met. The Black Lagoon came home alone."
