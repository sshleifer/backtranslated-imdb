For my life, I can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. It was useless. Matthew Modine was terribly disappointed as a leading ladies man. Gina Gershon, well, others said it, but I'll repeat why the stupid accent? Completely unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I don't know if she was thrown by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl Modine fell in love, suddenly she shook half a head of lettuce in her mouth and played in a solid way? Where did it come from? I think we had to feel sorry for her because we saw her marriage crumbling with a workaholic, but frankly, I couldn't care less about any of these people.
