When I saw previews of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but it will be at least funny. Well, I was wrong. Although the producers were deep somewhere, the producers had an interesting message to say that parents are left alone and revalue their lives. The way they tried to deliver the message was terrible. The first fifty times was something stupid with the couple, relatively funny. But in the end I could almost predict what a foolish accident will happen next. <br /> <br /> In the course of the movie I keep a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything is at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.
