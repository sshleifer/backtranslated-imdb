Is this movie a joke? Is this a comedy? Isn't that a serious excitement? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but the poor acting, poor directing and scary writing laughed the audience out loud in the theater. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist who has just hit his peak shot by an assassin who he accidentally enters. The murderer considers the young artist's work portfolio he carries and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition, the murderer meets the dead artist's sister and falls in love. These are all very predictable things and the end will not guess anyone because it is so poorly written. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city is. Don't waste your time on this movie unless you study how not to react, direct or write a movie!
