There are only two movies I will give a 1/10 to this stinker and "The Man who Fell to Earth." I remember the protocol at a theater in the early 80's when I was in high school. The writing is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the "hillarious" ghost of someone shot in the buttocks. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming, but comes across as vapid and moron. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie who wins over everyone, spitting out populist dribbles. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I couldn't stand to see another movie she was in until IMO delivered herself to everyone. I love you. This is the kind of movie you make if you don't want to bother with writing games. The worst.
