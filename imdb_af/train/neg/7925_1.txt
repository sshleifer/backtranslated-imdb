Do you want a good recipe for failure? Take a s **** y plot, add in some weak, completely undeveloped characters and throw in the worst special effects a horror movie knew. Leave the stove for a week (the amount of time spent probably making this trash). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places. <br /> <br /> The movie was completely blown. My words cannot convey how painful it was to look. It's not one of the bad movies you and your friends can sit down and have fun with. It's not Plan 9 from outer space. It is a long, tedious, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. I suppress myself when I realize that people have actually taken time out of their lives to act in this shit if you can call it. But again, if you have poor direction, the poor story writing, poor everything, acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a big, disgusting doom that you desire to quickly flush out, fearing that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. I really can somehow destroy every copy of this movie with me, so it won't pollute the thoughts of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me new respect for every movie I've ever seen. You showed me what's really terrible, and why do I appreciate all the movies that are just crappy or boring.
