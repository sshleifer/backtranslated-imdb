I wanted to keep this movie - the shots were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had great photography. But even for a filmed cartoon, it was a very bad movie. The continuity and pacing were just awful. The best bits in the movie are under the final credits, so it's (almost) worth sticking out (although it's remarkable, it takes a little over the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, you know there should be a problem ...
