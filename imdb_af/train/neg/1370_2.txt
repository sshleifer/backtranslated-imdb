**** WARNING: Here are spoilers **** Why do I waste my hasty refugees so dirty? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, poor writing, worse directing, and then we didn't even have the acting. <br /> <br /> And of course you can predict the whole story from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Heroic fighting against stupid, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. A deluge goes down, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to live out, despite the fact that they are going through all sorts of rock hanger. Corrupt partner who caused the whole thing is roasted alive with his payout money. Second flood is heroically derived from the apostate experiment's apostate experiment. Bad henchmen eventually come out to have a heart too. Unhappy teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her. Etc., etc., etc., up and down. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little reason to warn spoilers. You can probably work out the whole plot if I have given you the basic ingredients. At least I wasn't too far from the point most of the time, and expected what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we didn't discuss the factual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually some detached features, even from a bad movie. you will be hard pressed to find someone in this one. I think I gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice landscapes, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It has been a while since a movie moaned me, but this one definitely did.
