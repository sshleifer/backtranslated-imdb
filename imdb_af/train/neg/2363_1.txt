This movie was just awful, the first movie wasn't that good, I mean it's ridiculous if they didn't have enough with the first 5 movies you had to add one more, why not make it in a continuous series like James Bond, I will tell you exactly why because the bondage films are really good and these movies just stink, I don't understand, it was supposed to be a cross between genres like horror and comedy for goodness, is me 1 year old cousin will not be afraid of such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who want to be scared at some point in a so-called horror movie. Please don't keep these movies anymore.
