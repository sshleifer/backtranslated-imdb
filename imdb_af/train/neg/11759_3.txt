For those who are looking for a sequel to the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s, this is not the case. It's also not a historical drama. Rather, it is an urgent fantasy that has nothing to do with the historical Shaka, but merely uses his name to give a certain chuckle to Sinclair's idiotic story of an African superhero combining Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela are. . <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Shaka breaks the cross he is chained to and kicks some serious slave butt. You know, as Jesus would have if he were not such a wimp. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can't believe twice as much of this crazy would have been better. <br /> <br /> What kind of name is Mungo?
