It may not be the worst movie Steve Martin ever made, but it was definitely far from his best. Obviously he did the crap for the pay check. Dreck like this definitely does nothing to improve his reputation as a funny man. What he doesn't understand is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie, they are expected to be entertained, not bored. It is sad that he has dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I don't understand why talented people can't get hold of the fact that people don't want to see them in lousy movies. If you want to call a movie a comedy, then it should be funny. It wasn't. Shame on the US Army to allow it to be associated with this mob. Full Metal Jacket laughed more than this unfortunate excuse for a "service comedy." Certainly, Phil Silvers rolls over in his grave.
