It is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialog set up and you hear the voices recorded at a recording stand at the same time! It's an amateur movie featuring Boston actors and shot around New Hampshire. For those who live and read in New Engalnd, this commentary will be waved with a capital W. This movie is full of errors. You get the director's voice giving directions and giving directions to the actress. "OK, get up now." Like the other characters. There is this guy who speaks in his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The strange man speaks with a deep voice. When he throws or whims when he fights, you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! It was Brett Piper's early work to cry out loud! The creatures are good, but the animation is rough. Really jerky. Kind like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGIN OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Things are good. Bottom line, this movie makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes-string budget? A must look for aspiring film makers.
