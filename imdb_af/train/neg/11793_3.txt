Deep Shock plays like a TV movie: a whole role-players of commercial quality actors, a poorly-crafted creature to be the 'bad man', and a text that is more full of technical, political jargon and input than what he knows what to do with. <br /> <br /> I checked the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos) and to the right of the bat I was disappointed because the creatures on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected due to the type of film are (really generic and not thought about a point). The music was typical, non-thought-action-symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I like the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini sub design. The movie even flowed really well, with the screens telling you which set you are watching the story unfold. But there isn't much of a story here anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 3/10 star IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to inflate the North Pole and these creatures protect it ... kinda lame. Even lame is the marked love relationship between two characters you don't see. Get this one into a movie trying to get actors' careers off the bank and into a video. Don't bother.
