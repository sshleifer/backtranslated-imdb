I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror movies to warm other people about this terrible and very bad horror movie. Don't waste your time or money on this movie, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst things I've experienced and the writing was just awful. Nothing about it was good, you end up thinking about yourself why I'm looking at this shit. The plot had so many holes in it and they eventually never ran out, it was just as bad, I don't know how a movie can be made so terrible. As I said before, I love horror movies and I was lowered, it was an 18, but you see little blood and no fright or jumping. What also irritated me was how silly things happened in the movie that was not on the plot, like the brother and sister kissing, why? is all I can say. Just don't bother, there are much more big horror movies out there, just don't waste your time, life is too short.
