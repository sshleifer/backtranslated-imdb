No, it wasn't one of the ten worst movies of the 1980s, but it certainly shot the bottom 100 somewhere. This movie seems to have been put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else will you explain special effects that preceded: A US Werewolf in London, disco is still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan is not the 40th president of the United States? While we're on it, we shouldn't overlook the 1970's hairstyles in the 1950s and 60s. I saw more of this than combined in the "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley". <br /> <br /> The one woman raising this movie to the "so bad, it's good" category was the late, big Elizabeth Hartman, but scarce. Steak playing like me. Montgomery, a high school teacher who becomes a sex pot, a stereotype killed and still called by Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" she retains her musical qualities. Her call to help is proof of this. She also looks much better than me. Wimp. "Seven dollars at the beauty room, shot at hell." She didn't create. <br /> <br /> It's not to say that there aren't any good parts, they're just a few and far between, and I'm not just saying I don't like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf too" was better than that, and it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br />
