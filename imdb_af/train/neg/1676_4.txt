Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors give decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Notorious for his goodies, a drug addict and a man who, despite Aids, still made adult movies, just doesn't make an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a brutal mass murder that occurred in Los Angelos in the late 80's, after which Holmes was arrested, arrested and charged with murder and eventually acquitted . Just as in the case of PB, the debt factor, regardless of the outcome, went quite high in the "He did it" zone. <br /> <br /> There is no one to sympathize with in this movie, as everyone is a self-service judge. There is nothing interesting here.
