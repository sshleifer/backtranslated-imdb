Garson Kanin has written and directed this look at today's Las Vegas and the intergenerational gap, his first attempt since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat miscarried as a large-scale casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks confusingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene in the same way: defensive, with a slide on his shoulder. To play this role, cool and relaxing, asks too much of Janssen, who barks like a coarse man (he even throws Don Rickles out and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well looking for his own identity, makes hip-hop remarks on how young people look down at Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-confident secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun little bit like a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, a few fast-paced T&A shots and amusing satirical bits on the high-gambling world of gambling, where they no longer go, as well as the newly dated adult and child ethnic ruminations. most of which are now covered by ad nauseum. ** of ****
