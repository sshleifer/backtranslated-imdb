You know how sometimes you can see a crappy movie with friends and all the shortcomings of the movie? Well, it was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie you could laugh at. It's really nothing too pathetic. About 30 minutes into the movie my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour we compromised to finish fast so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and we watched Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, don't see this movie. It's over painful.
