I really enjoyed visiting this photo. It felt like I was putting this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I don't understand what they thought when they did it. It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer's murder and it has no end. It almost feels as if they are opening this movie for a successor. It was like a television episode of Sopranos. It ends suddenly, and you know there will be another episode next week. It also felt like I was just watching part 1 for a two-film. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; They got lazy, they ran money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a Dahmer 2. Having seen this movie, it all sounds very accurate. I saw Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the forest. Suddenly I heard this music playing, then writing on the screen saying how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow resident and murdered at the age of 34. Wow, he's going from a step in the woods to his death in prison. How about showing how he got there. How about Dahmer's trial. How about a little more detail. I can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. I told myself in disbelief, "That's it, it's the end?" I want to deduce this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie to be made. For the filmmakers I would like to say, if you are going to do it, do it right.
