There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the smallest scrap of talent. No one in it ever tried to react, even the extras in the coffee shop looked as if they were glued. Nothing resembled it. The movie quality is terrible. Most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or flats with the cameraman being captured as an afterthought, turning a cheap camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' while delivering their lines. No tripod and no proper microphone, there is sound quality terrible. Even 'Manos' prices are better than this, at least they have proper equipment. Which plot is lost only in the production loss. <br /> <br /> Stick to home videos, preferably made by a 5 year old child trying to try out the video feature on the dad's new camera. You'll be in a long search to find a movie more inactive than that.
