This movie is so much of a rip-off of the mainstream "demons" and it's the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The play is terrible, the action scenes are speeding up, the script is almost painful and budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, you haven't seen a real horror movie, skip it and get a copy of the movie demons.
