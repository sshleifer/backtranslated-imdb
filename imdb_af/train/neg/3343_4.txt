Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses to save the life of a young girl from the enemy and haunted this event, although he saved many other captive children. The movie flashes a head and this soldier is now a high school teacher who is mostly run by policemen who patrol the corridors, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, High School is a prison and most children pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides to stop going on another field. However, the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. It's at this point in the movie when the whole hell breaks loose and the story becomes a full BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you have decided to view IT!
