Cannon draws a true visual beauty from a medieval epic that looks fascinating (except for the dragon's prop). Now, how did the long-lasting studio known for Chuck Norris movies ever get a complete lack of knowledge? Case in point: the amateur-like acting and horrible plot is a sign that the medieval legend is reviving, no healing for a bit of haphazard execution. They actually went ahead and made another cheap mining with hundreds of funny bimbos, just to make this look even better. For the two "Barbarian Brothers" they know how to make strange noises than brave warriors are so strong and brave enough to save their homeland. It's the biggest potential waste of potential I've seen from an "expensive" low-budget movie, and worse enough to drop an ax through the beautiful print without mercy. All this followed an advertising campaign selling T-shirts based on BARBARANE! The movie alone makes a good souvenir!
