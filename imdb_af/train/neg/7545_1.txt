It's a pity you can't go any less than one star. Before I watched the Wicker Man, I saw Aliens 3 as the only movie that would actually earn negative stars. In all fairness, the Wicker Man does not detract from the enjoyment of a previous movie, but the fact remains that my cumulative film enjoyment was reduced by seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick that is often used in Hollywood if the producers are too firm to hire or hurry good writers to enable them to draw a plot to a satisfactory conclusion Bring in a shocking end and hope the public will miss it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case only manages to embarrass an actor and mock the producers. Even more so, the "carefully crafted" (or indeed they) conclusion does not follow logically from the plot (which of course I cannot expand without introducing spoilers) and instead ignoring what merit the plot had until then. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that can logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly mortal Nicholas Cage fans, but only for some of the mainstream. If you really want something about this, I highly recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. If I lose a kind of memory loss pill, I have to look a little better to force it off my head, say: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-Wee's Big Adventure?
