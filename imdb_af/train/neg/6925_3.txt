I feel much less generous with this movie than others of his ilk. The depiction of evildoers in this century is always done with the fact that they are so completely bizarre to be another species. Their denials are so outrageous that they are totally fictional. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. They are making or defeating each other. It's as if the scriptwriter has said, what can I do for them without a sense of what madness or even mental illness is. Look at the wonderful human depiction in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where the diseases are credible and actually. I once worked in a state hospital. I didn't see any of these guys. This is too clever and calculated to make them alive.
