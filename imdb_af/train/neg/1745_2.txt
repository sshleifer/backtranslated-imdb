The first half of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. But suddenly everything went too fast, a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very hard about what Akshey and John Abraham did. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, but Paresh Rawal did well, but not as well as his performance in Hera Pheri. Overall this movie was the biggest disappointment. The movie has no right to its trailer. save your money and don't look at this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> This summary: a cheap stage performance and movie appearance, no story or substance, the plot was extraordinary - feel good music by Preetam, the man we bought Dhoom! keep it up! The movie is all in one room, the new comers (female cast) were good as it was their first movie, but established actors like Akshey and John disappointed that an established director like Priyadarshan ever gives his worst movie ever!
