Not as bad as some make it to be, although of course it is pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was big like the villain Babban Singh - trying not to compare to Gabbar in the original because it was clearly not for the same effect. However, unlike some mediocre action scenes, the rest of the movie is flawed. Character development was poor and the story's development was hopeless, with lots of loopholes, and lacking information I wouldn't have known if I didn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and especially this new man, Prashant Raj. Nisha is just annoying at the time her lips are open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously, who is this man? where was he from and why was he on earth in the film studio for nothing but serving drinks? His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialogue and strong expression in every scene, be it action, comedy or even a scene when someone is just dead. Ajay Devgan was average, at least changing his expressions which is more than I can say for his fault with a companion. Overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's sturdy show, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special look.
