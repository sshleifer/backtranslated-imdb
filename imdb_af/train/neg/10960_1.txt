Ouch! They don't get much worse than this terrible adaptation of C. S. Lewis' beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel, the play is just awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale similar to a school game. I read that the budget for these miniseries was the biggest thing the BBC had ever given, but surely they could have scrapped a little over $ 2. It looks like it's been filmed. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects weren't at the level needed or even cost effective at the moment, but the costume shopkeeper in a packing show was terrible. Better just cut the character out of the movie if it does! Avoid it at all costs.
