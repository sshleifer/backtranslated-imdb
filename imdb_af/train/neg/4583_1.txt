If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human potential and potential, see "Waking Life", which is brilliant. "What the # $ *! We Know" is generally in his focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly behaved, completely without any artistic direction and totally annoying. It wasn't in the slightest thoughts or entertainment. The inclusion of that rambling freak "Ramtha" in this movie is reason enough to avoid it. Isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look at the fact that this woman worships about 2,000 years old Atlantic god or something? What a flake is the old chick, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this movie may not make another movie again.
