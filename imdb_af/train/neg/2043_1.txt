Terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> A disapproving start at the beginning and a few nasty autopsy pictures doesn't make a good movie. Again, I am amazed at the determination and skill some people have to bring about a film production, yet they are not proud to realize that what they have made is a turbulent hope. <br /> <br /> I sat trying to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism, but the only one I could think of was that the opening run by Pink was pretty good. I wonder if she saw it? <br /> <br /> Look at your danger, the boredom can kill you.
