It was one hour in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don't judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We are back in time during Spanish settlements. A group came to an island. It doesn't take too long before they get a big "reptile" that keeps their horse up. Soon they are caught by the natives and to get freedom, they must kill the "reptile gods". The CG sucks; It reminds me of the CG of early console video games. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing to say about this was the hottie indigenous running around in a skimpy outfit. Otherwise, it's just an easy attempt.
