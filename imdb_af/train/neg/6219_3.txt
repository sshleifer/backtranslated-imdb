When the MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to believe it would be so heartwarming as some of the first Lassie movies were. Not. <br /> <br /> The story was uncomfortable, the songs of the Sherman brothers were far below their ordinary level, the characters were oninspired and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY both saw much better days. <br /> <Afterwards, I was also interested in what ALICE FAYE's contribution was, as she had been absent from the screen for so many years and was always in her earlier roles at Fox. Alice was also staggering by the foolish writing and the unbearable photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing even interesting for an adult to enjoy - and clearly, no magic present to anyone. You can hit this one without missing anything.
