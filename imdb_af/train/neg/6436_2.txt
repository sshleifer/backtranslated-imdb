I'm a kind of person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. There was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas touched, that is, what Jesus really wanted us to know, was moved over and instead we gave heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment that our heroine (Arquette) had given. Total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would be more humane for both her character and audience. The acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired. And if I saw another drop of water or pigeon in the direction of the camera, I might start shouting harder than Patricia.
