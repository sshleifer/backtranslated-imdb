Oh, it was a very bad movie. The girl Jennifer plays is good, but I think she's bitchy by the movie, not because she tore her organs out of the shelf at night, but because she's thinking of shooting her agent to make her crazy. . Faye Dunaway acts as if she remembers Mama Dear and the end is completely stupid. I really can't recommend this movie, although as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was a bit intrigued by the references to his work (Ravens, House of Usher-like family curse, and buried alive) will probably be in his grave changed when he knew about this movie.
