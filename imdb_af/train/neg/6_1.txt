From the start of the movie it gives the feeling that the director is trying to portray something, which I mean to say that instead of the story he dictates the style in which the film is to be made, a kind of movement he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suit it. And he succeeded very badly. I think he was trying to make an attractive movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director he knows the media with which he works. What I'm trying to say is that I've seen the worst movies than this. Here the director knows the continuity in the movie. And the actors also gave a decent performance.
