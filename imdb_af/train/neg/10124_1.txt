there is no tension in this series! When one episode ends, the play is so embarrassed, the effects are so poor and the writing is so terrible that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, the last thing to consider is the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't see how it was ever made, let alone on DVD! Obviously the effects aren't familiar with current Batman movies, but even the writing is awful. An intrepid chatter about an evil professor and a shotgun or something like that, I don't quite know, because it's too terrible to follow. Watch the 60's version, or the 90's versions, or even Batman Begins, just anything about this version!
