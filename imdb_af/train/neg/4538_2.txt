I actually went to see this movie in a theater, but what a total waste of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry to say, didn't help enjoy this tough tough script. <br /> <br /> Some friends have told me to watch this movie, as James Redfield, the author of the book, was very involved in the script. They enjoyed the book very much, so the movie had to be perfect. Well, I had a little too high my hopes, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to a point I actually left, I had to braai, and worst of all, there will be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this horrific crusade.
