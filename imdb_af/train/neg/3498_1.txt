I just watched one episode of this program and I couldn't even get to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program. I had to lose about 10 points. It's basically like a kid's program, but with a curse. Not even the curse and the insults she told other people, made me laugh. Anyway, the story must be written by a monkey and the people who used this script for this program for this program should be kept from the rifle point and have no choice but to film this delayed, disappointing, horrible action . Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some divine plays.
