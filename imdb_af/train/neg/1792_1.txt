Allow me to start this review by saying: I love vampire movies. They can suck (have some intention) and I will still love them, because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing, who is considered by many to be a steaming pile of shit, was a pleasure for me because there were vampires. You may ask, "What does this movie have to do?" The answer is that I will tell you how horrible this movie really is, that even a sucker (harharhar) for vampire movies can despise such a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Van Helsing, a college professor man who is not convincing. He's a terrible actor, like everyone in this movie, and he wrote it to add salt to the wound. I have to say honestly not to insult him, and I'm sure everyone had fun making this movie, but it was actually painful. I'm not sure why I watched the whole thing; Perhaps it was a morbid fascination, like seeing an impending train accident: it's horrible, but you can't force yourself to look away. His biggest mistake is that it's just as boring, and his plot is so ridiculous, even for a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> But I diverge. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mother. Of course he does not know that it was her then; He just thinks it's one of his students (who is still illegal and everything, but not so disgusting and creepy). <br /> <br /> If I was Van Helsing, I would draw myself an Oedipus when I found out. I did something so rough. It would have made one entertaining thing if he had just commented on it, but no. The point is not even staged by any of the characters at all. It's as if the author doesn't even think about it. I would have had at least another character on him and say, "Ha ha, you had sex with your mother," which would be slightly humorous (though blatantly immature). I'm probably out of the room, a few words to discourage you from ever seeing this movie: there's a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It will be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay far, far away if you appreciate your time. <br /> <br /> I would say one thing positive about the movie: the guy playing Van Helsing is pretty smooth with that knife of his. There is a minute-long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some fine tricks. It will be boring in any other movie, but unfortunately this was the highlight.
