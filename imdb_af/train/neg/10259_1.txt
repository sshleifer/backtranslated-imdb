I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience of being cut off by a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was good, but I later found out that it had every blast or "special effect" in the whole movie (about 4) and even some that weren't in the movie. There was some kind of plot related to the strangers, but the strangers were never actually shown in the movie, as far as I remember. It was obviously a case that someone made a cheap movie to cheat people. I think my world of innocence ended that day when I found out there were bad people out there making bad bad movies.
