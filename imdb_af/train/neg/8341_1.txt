I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most cheese (see it, 9 out of 10 horror movies these days are CHEESE), but it was just ridiculous. Terrible acting, horrible writing, totally hollow and amazing characters (no Meisner actors here!) And a total lack of adequate body numbers. I wish I could sell the 79 minutes of my life. I just wasted. At least the Crook brothers are called appropriately. The only good thing about the whole movie was watching Alicia Silverstone face in the face. How it ever made Sundance a real surprise to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by the scraper film standards. I mean, come on! Who will be in a hurry to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker man has just left their doorstep? Lamb.
