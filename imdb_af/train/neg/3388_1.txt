I admit that I was a fan of the original stage production. I have never seen the movie version until recently on the cable, and I watched it to see that my memories were alive again, because I worshiped the original show. Imagine my horror. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst translation of a Broadway show ever made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. I expected to download a trip, singing for the extraordinary touch of Music and the Mirror, At the Ballet, and Hi Twelve, Hello Thirteen. Not! Not only did they plunder the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they ruined the storyline, adding songs and outlines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) that were not present in the original and injecting a "drama" where it was not necessary. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't bother it. I'm sorry, I wasted my time, and my memories dilute, look at this time.
