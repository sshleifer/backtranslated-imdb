Just sent a friend who is in the film school about this movie. Something to avoid when making a movie - characters are blatant of senseless, overwhelmed, winding monologues on the screen that are ultimately tragic and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal outbursts are so exaggerated that they actually pay attention to the film being made as a film and effectively neutralizing that purpose. Is it the acting or the bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also extremely incredible for social realism - a mysterious canonical English literature and the Bible while he is tall or hungry and is capable of producing such deep sophomoric soliloquy while drunk? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed, orally harmful character that most of the women he meets can be found within minutes of them? (I had to applaud when one party finally threw him out on the street, despite his shaky and self-pity). <br /> <br /> The viewer meets pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the book of Revelation. The impending punishment of mankind, in the form of bar codes that are put on our forehead or right-handed hands in ghostly biblical fashion, is presented to a character who, in his role as guardian of empty space, is indescribably exposed. <br /> <br /> This movie is overwritten and over a melodrama that is uncomfortably applied to pedestrian philosophy about the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It is thin, overwhelmed and boring. <br /> <br /> There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this movie. "Zero at Mouth" is an excellent, much more interesting outing in the lives of individuals in a similar social environment. It's for "In the Warzone." And even though the comparison is not even fair, look at Peter Greenaway, discussing dialogue, whites and absurd characters and situations more wisely.
