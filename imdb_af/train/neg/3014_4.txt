I recently viewed landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. As a photographer I was drawn to the movie because I am both known and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe the movie gets a good job of conveying the message, I couldn't help but feel it was made as a complete memory of the photos and subsequent popular book by Burtynsky. Clearly, one of the reasons for this is the use of silent and pans stills about them. Although this is a good effect when used economically, I felt that 75% of the movie was just about Burtynsky's book (which I already own). It's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with his work, you might be better off hitting this one.
