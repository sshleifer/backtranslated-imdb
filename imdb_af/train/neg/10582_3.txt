Initially, I was convinced that it was a television for television that was not worth primetime. But after a few minutes of stunned awe, I realized there was at least comic value in the top stunts and c-film shows. This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I didn't laugh so hard if we saw it in the wonder that the actors could hold a straight face. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick had chosen to marry Elena, and not Jim, after all the hug and high-fives. A few rum and coke will definitely help make it easier.
