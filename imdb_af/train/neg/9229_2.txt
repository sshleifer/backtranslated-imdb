It's a movie about making a movie. Such movies can be entertaining, but they need some measure to do so. It didn't happen here, I'm scared. Mr. Coppola didn't inherit his father's skills. Unfortunately he didn't do his sister either. However, he can make movies you can see. <br /> <br /> I wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the main male actor, presumably a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same place as he says, the main female actress has an expression her face that never changes, the plot is completely segmented into bits with perhaps one single connecting element. The film within the film idea should be more aging than paleolithic rocks. Would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regret every moment I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is far superior to this amazing lame movie. It's like a Fran√ßois Truffaut plot managed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You really have to joke ...
