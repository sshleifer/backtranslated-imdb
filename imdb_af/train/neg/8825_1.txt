The only reason to even give this movie a single star is how much the end made me laugh. I had great hope because I usually like bad championship holiday horror movies, but it just didn't qualify. It's really just a bad attempt to slow down a character move in the madness, which is not a bad plot again, but is poorly done here. There are a few scenes (like the end) that aren't meant to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a few times when I thought the movie was actually in an interesting direction, but it never met what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas slip movie, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
