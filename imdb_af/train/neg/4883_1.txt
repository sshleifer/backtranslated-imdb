During the inexpensive filmed video of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same movie on the cover. Unfortunately it was. The story itself is unceasingly simple. Ethel, a murderous mania with an eating disorder, is released in a halfway home due to the overcrowding of the hospital. She is by far the most healthy resident, while one man sits dead flies in another soup. Ethel is then punched by one of the halfway house workers with a chocolate bar after taking the cost cut measure to feed the residents dog food. Ethel retaliates through him with a wireless bump on the stairs and then .... well, you get the idea. If it all looks fun, it is not. This film is poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so timid when they deliver their lines that they stand out in front of a cigar shop. To make matters worse, half of the movie consists of flashbacks of the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is a little better. A VERY poor effort.
