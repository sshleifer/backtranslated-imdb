Hard guys, sexy women, lots of curses and a most unconvincing monster coming from the depths of a polluted lake. You'd think "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not really. However, it makes star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, and in my book it makes it at least once worth watching. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed the bulk of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - which was only the footage with his children Andrea and Glenn (what characters Andrea and Glenn in a particularly inventive turn) - received full credit. Predominantly how terrible the end result was, Strock was probably glad he was not credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of a TV movie between mid-to-seventies, which is why I would love to put it in the background. As entertainment, it falls flat on its face, but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of movie recording, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car hunt.
