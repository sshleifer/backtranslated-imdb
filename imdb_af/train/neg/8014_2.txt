"Wild Animals I Know." It will only be displayed in big cities, to be sure. It's one of those movies SO artistic, it doesn't make sense like that, except for the director! I hate it! And all of the oh-so-alternative / artsy people are trying to EXPERIENCE to find "metaphors" in what the EVIDENT horseshit is. <br /> <br /> There was NO plot, no story, no moral, no chronology and nothing amusing. or even touch. For me it was a lot of scenes that were put together that had nothing to do with each other, and everyone was for the "show" to show how "artistic" and "visual" they could get. It was an ATTEMPT at another OTHER teenage harvest film, but missed the mark at every level humanly. Then the credits will roll! I waited for it to make SENSE! I waited for the good part. I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which are likely to be considered as home cinema films. It will NOT be among them. You will be very angry with yourself for paying to watch this movie, much less to ever buy it on DVD.
