Deceived by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun like American Pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and this is certainly not one. You probably won't even laugh once you're not one of those Jackass-like teenagers. It's not even an erotic movie, which would be something anyway, as it's about sex. <br /> <br /> So what is it? The erratic plot is about a man who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember "losing it" to one) and his gang friends. The rest of the characters (that is, the girls) come and go unbelievably. Come on, there are even Dwarves (so simple: "dwarfs are fun ho ...") The play is very TV-like (like the video looks through the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most girls .. . <br /> <br /> Awful movie. Amateur, badly produced, and not everything fine. Kids and teenagers will love to see it with friends because of the curse and the jokes. Other than that, don't even think about renting this movie.
