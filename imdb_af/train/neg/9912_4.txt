I totally agree with another of the reviewers here that "For The Birds" was happy. The Oscar won "Best Animated Short" in 2002, not this sick material. This is pretentious faith in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good but so are many animated shorts. And by the way, I love dark humor, but it was just going from the start. <br /> <br /> As for the story here: a man surrounded and surrounded by nothing but gray (symbolism here) is told by a TV set (which every few hundred meters away) that he in heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he puts a gun on his head and shot him at the news. I think it will be funny in two of the three cases.
