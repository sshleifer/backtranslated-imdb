I saw this movie in my international movie class and got rid of it. This movie is nothing but one scene from blatant shock to the next. <br /> <br /> The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer called Reve, who has visions of his unforeseen danger. He meets a woman named Christine when presenting a lecture at a local book club, and just decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To make this sticker, Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So convects reve a plan to deceive Christine's boyfriend so he can eventually have sex with him. But she later discovered that Christine had 3 previous men who killed her all. Now Reve and Christine's boyfriend can be "THE 4th MAN". The storyline makes sense with no plot holes. The editing and everything technical of this movie is perfect. The movie is just gross and I had the need to vomit in some areas. Basically, it's not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Reve out of bed in just a t-shirt. So in the beginning, you see Reve's beautiful cock moving around while standing in his cockroach in a bakkie. Later he had a dream where his pecker was cut off by a pair of scissors, and they showed it with the blood fountain being followed. Reve funds an image of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. There is also a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is just as blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole movie is converted to the shock value. <br /> <br /> So if any of these is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far away from this one. My thoughts are still scarce.
