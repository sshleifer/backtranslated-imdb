I usually look at the MTV movie prize to see a spectacular, entertaining show that offers a unique awards show (Chewbacca wins a lifetime achievement award example). So this year was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott was always funny-albite stupid. I laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even enjoyed him in Dude Where's My Car ?. But the MTV movie awards were simply awful. Nothing was coherent, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake must continue to sing and dance; he is sure hell cannot act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about who the authors were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny. (The Parody alone of the Rings was worth watching the whole show), but this year was completely different. Did anyone understand Timberlake's comment on Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're staring in a movie, but have never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke only went into their lame dialogue and never made a reference to the "joke" of Timberlake. And Seann was totally wasted as a talent, not even letting me smile, but laughing. And what was the point of Harrison Ford's one-liners? Did they make any sense to anyone? Perhaps the MTV authors are of the opinion that young viewers only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or Air Force One's president. I'm surprised. And will anyone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this man and how old does he think he is? The old corpse 30, trying to act 19 again. Give it up, show a little class (as in your best actor academy awards) and record your age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for the best visual performance. It was very creative, very well done, and caused the only real laugh of the whole evening.
