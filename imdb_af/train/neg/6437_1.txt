Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing really happened in this movie, except a woman inexplicably bleeding. Second, it wasn't scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me expand. The sound was edited by Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure what, so let's go with Beavis. The movie slowly and quietly mumbles and mumbles and forces you to set the volume (I watched it at home). Then Beavis blows a few very loud sounds with so-called scary / shocking images, forcing you to quickly decrease the volume. This happens many times to, graciously, the movie ends. I can light Beavis lightly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group every time for the remote descent. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought ?? If you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a gratuitous beheading, a 19-year-old blonde girl screaming on top of her lungs just before she can shoot her jersey, the shadow on someone's wall is eaten alive Just outside the camera range, a cat thrown at the camera to scare the audience, a little silly weirdo with a manic laugh or a monster that looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil. ). These people didn't even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
