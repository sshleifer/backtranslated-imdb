How viewers respond to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted if NOT a repetition of the original 1963 movie (true enough), I suspect, on the following: those who are great fans of either the book or original movie is not much of this one think ... and those who have never been exposed and who are great fans of Hollywood's current tendency to "special effects" is the first and last word in how "good a movie is going to like it. <br /> <br /> Things I didn't like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was NOT a true adaptation of the book. From the articles I read, this film was supposed to cover other aspects of the book that the first one never came across, and it was reasonable, no movie could cover a book word by word unless it was the length (And not even) But there were things in this movie that were never in the movie it has been noticed or even hammered. Remind me of the way they decided to kill the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING. I didn't like it either. What the film's press release has to say is ... "We had the basic, very basic idea of ​​Shirley Jackson's book, we had the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the main characters. , but then we decided to write our own story, and how we looked at the CHANGE and SHINING and GHOST, and decided to throw some of them. "<br /> <br /> 2 They completely lost the theme of a parapsychologist. He carefully selected the guest who all had brushes with the paranormal in their past, to investigate a truly born house. No, instead, this "doctor" all got home under the false pretense of studying their "insomnia" (he really invited them to kill them and then watched them respond to their fears. Like laboratory gears, whom he mentioned, never said they were part of an experiment ... yummy). This doctor, who didn't have the same name, was so different at that time from the dedicated professional of the original movie than night. <br /> <br /> 3. In contrast to the proposition used to promote both movies, a few homes were born badly. This home is not badly born, but has become bad because of what happened. And this time Nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of change). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was so indifferent that I was sure it was a mystery to most of the audience. But then in the first place there was no mystery (not in the book) because the house was bad to start. This is the first "victim" to die before he ever looked at it. <br /> <br /> 4. The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who had to inherit the house one day (and was a true skeptic of history). And in this one, he was just a vined, bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep (remembering insomnia) and was a doctrinal kid. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped, almost trying to recreate original scenes for word (the scene with Nel's sister's family and Dudley's small opening speech. ..) to run out of fancy that reminds me of more of these other movies than the haunting. It's as if it couldn't work out what it wanted to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed Nel's story through the whole movie. The original was like a gothic novel in the way the story was mostly told in the first person by Nel's eyes and we always thought of her thoughts. The totally unique touch is completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be different after she brought 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a bad sister?) And she wanted to complain , and she lost her temper. .. This one was almost too good to be true. It was never more obvious than in the climax of the movie where the author obviously looked too much GHOST. <br /> <br /> 7. They have changed the history of the house and it takes up too much. There was no Abigail Crain (Hugh's daughter whose legend was great in the original versions), there was no "companion" and there was no nursery. There was also no "Grace" (original doctor's wife) and Hugh Crain's wives died in different ways. These changes have changed the story WAY too much. I don't know if the producers of this movie will be happy. Shirley Jackson no longer runs this earth or they have to be ... SORRY (if you get my drift away! The ghost she could see is not something to mind. With !!!). Finally, let me just leave you with a few words from the original Luke (appropriate replacement of the word "house" for "movie"!): "This film" must be burned on the ground, and the soil has salt sprinkled! "My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this one.
