This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants, he had a super power to be oral pleasure. I see the film in the kingdom of childish 14-year-old male fantasies. The bed room scene was on top and reduced an intimate moment in a variety of biological features related to passing gas in public. From the very first to every other scene, there was a conversation about how little sex they were getting, how long it had been since they got a little, when their next sexual engagement would be and with whom it should be. In addition, the dialogue and acting were very poor and forced, they did not feel, and they filled their lack of content with messy sex scenes. It could have been very funny, because the concept is actually interesting, but it is poorly executed. Please, don't even think of taking someone under 16 if you have to see it.
