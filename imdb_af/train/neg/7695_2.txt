I was in such high expectations to see an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian nights. Instead, I was disappointed in a movie that didn't keep my attention from the beginning, though I tried to watch it twice! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but it didn't look much, as the actors didn't have equality. For something, a little like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> OK, so Sun of the Dragon has many possible fans out there, but if you are looking for something to wow in terms of martial arts and plot line you won't get it. If you just want the kids to sit down on a Sunday afternoon, then it might be for you with the 3 ninjas.
