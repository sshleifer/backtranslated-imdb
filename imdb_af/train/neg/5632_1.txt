I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the US) and felt it was indeed a really horrible movie. But they had to cut quite a bit from the original movie, or I missed a lot. The sex scenes have very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I have read several other remarks on IMDb.com that call the vulgarity and something about a tampon. I didn't see anything like that, just a bad, boring movie with unlikely characters and a trite, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth to the chicks, and an expression of her face. And her name reminds me of a drink at Taco Bell: "I'll have the Cola Grande!" It was a pleasure, it was so bad, I had to play as I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000 and saw things like Dafoe's skin too big for his face. It's really like stupid putty!
