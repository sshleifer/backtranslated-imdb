It's just breathtaking in its horror - you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here: because he is the only one who can really get on his screen. lines with something similar to natural cadences and collisions, he ruins the movie by pointing out everybody's mistakes, or he saves them by giving some context to their horror. <br /> <br /> I tend to see later - thanks to him, it works as a high comedy. He is the 7 pedestrian in a game of dwarf baseball, his skill set does not apply in this context, and his discombobulation is nice. <br /> <br /> But the right surprise is me. Eastwood, whose inability to speak In clear English, is so pervasive that I am actually going to throw her and expect her to be a Russian beauty that phonetically expressed her lines, without understanding their meaning. But no, she's just a talent-free American that will make you laugh with every line she falls. Whether she knows what the lines mean, must remain open.
