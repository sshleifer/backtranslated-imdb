It worried me last night that Fox had spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment. It's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to believe. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the first morning of filming Raquel Welch from the shelf over her fireplace to prepare for the academy award will surely win for this brave original movie . Oops. This is not what happened. <br /> <br /> The lineup on the set was released by Rex Reed and it helped to get the movie before it was even announced. When it was finally released, there was no ordinary three ring circus of publicity. If I remember correctly, it opened in Houston at drives and neighborhood theaters and I never played one of the big places. <br /> <br /> I'm blaming most of director Michael Sarne, who was hot after targeting (it's not that good) JOANNA, a movie featuring young people swinging toward London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox sustained him and teamed up the film, the best they could. Therefore plays do not play in any particular order and characters then appear and disappear. An impressive supporting film (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) has been destroyed with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To extend this to length, there are numerous Fox movie clips with stars like Carmen Miranda (in incredible footage of the GANG's whole HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who never dreamed that they will play in an X-rated movie. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the X rating is numerous sexual perversions of language; But none of the characters seem to have fun. Perhaps someone who was involved in the film had a twisted Puritan sensitivity and thought that if they made these things unattractive, it wasn't bad to exploit them. <br /> <br /> It was one of the "youth" pictures that made Hollywood almost bankrupt in the 1970s. One author joked that EASY RIDER (which was made for business change) was the most expensive film ever made, because so many movies followed that were trying to duplicate its success. Sixtyish, once honored directors such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, made films such as RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience. White directors and writers tried to make films to attract a black audience. Those movies were locked up in a safe somewhere and called the two and many others of that genre were never exhausted, as I know, on the home video or cable. They are the deep dark secret of the studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in this is all considered good. With the right direction and script, she could have specialized in the kind of sassy liberated Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck women. She looks good and has fantastic costumes. Mae West is the liveliest seventy-something actress I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's a heartbreaking attempt to see her attempt to capture her glory from years to come, but I'm sure she needs the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget, X-rated movie from this era goes out to the valley of the mad (also of Fox) because it doesn't take itself seriously. It's crazy kids who play with the equipment at a great studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is trying to say something. There was just no one who wanted to listen.
