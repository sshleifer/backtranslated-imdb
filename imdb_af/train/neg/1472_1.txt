I'm terrified to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2 / 10. What strikes me is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm still wondering why I watched it to the end . First, the plot is completely hopeless, and the acting is really awful. I think a totally unknown actress would have been better than Susan Lucci; What Mr. As far as Kamar Del's Reyes is concerned, I think it would be better to stay in his "Valley of the Dolls". In summary, it's total waste of time (and I'm trying to remain polite ...) to avoid at any cost. My score is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but since we can't give an O ....
