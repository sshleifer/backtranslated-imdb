Yes, I hired it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A good foreground sets up an otherwise uncomfortable story with no real payout, but at least it's well shot. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a false haunted house with real danger. In most cases, it should be a slamdunk, but this little stinker saves pretty fast. The cinematography is above average and the acting is at its best mediocre, but the story and writing are just awful. Slower screens drag forever and the scarce is too little and far in the middle with no real climax to the movie. A frightening mood is set in the beginning, but it is lost shine before any kind of horror appears and I have bored myself and made another sandwich. The cover art is attractive and I think it is worth a rent if you are looking for a sensible low budget drink, but if you enjoy a good story and a gifted end, you achieve something else.
