Perhaps one of the most overstated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween contains the memorable Michael Myers and some great plays by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, the wake-up factor is very close to zero as there is an unforgettable amount of time to save on real-life events. This is the kind of movie you can start off with microwave popcorn and don't miss anything. <br /> <br /> How I have grown so many persecutors I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank you. Rob Zombie does it again. And generally I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he will compensate more for all the random timing gaps with some odd points of interest lacking in the original. <br /> <br /> This is a movie we feel we should like, like the way we are taught to enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Don't assume it's a classic.
