When I first saw a small scene in a few announcements, I thought the show would be entertaining to watch. The little robot man looks pretty cute. The style of animation seems to be familiar to some classic performances. Before the show broadcast, I studied it through some sources. There I was a little upset. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are well spoken, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much nicer if he were portrayed by a young boy. One good example is Robot Jones, a robot character of "What Happened to Robot Jones?" The show isn't really bad. But the way Robotboy is depicted improperly is my only criticism. So, I don't see much.
