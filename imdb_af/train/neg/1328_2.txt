It's a very silly movie in the typical 80's genre: action comedy. Conceptually it looks like Rush Hour, but the action, the laugh and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie are completely lacking. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just can't act. He is terrible if he tries to do tough things. He barely succeeds in keeping the brand while he says his one-liners are not really funny. And seeing him running (even back) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I feel that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even start my story. I give it a 2 out of 10.
