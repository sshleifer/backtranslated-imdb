For me, the only reason to look at these remakes was to see how bad and funny it could be. There was no doubt that it was funny and bad, because I saw "Voyna i mir" (1968). Will we start? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bezukhov - a lean man who lacks the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - a scarecrow, her image may cause insomnia; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Andrej Bolkonsky - an OK incarnation that, like the skinny man (cf. above), misses the depth of a Russian soul and "struggles inside"; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a rather unimportant leader; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Prince Bolkonsky - a maze with an English face; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Count Bezukhov - a spinless freak show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters aren't much better. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the way they look and talk are often horrible. They act like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. It all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and women of the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> A great piece of entertainment to watch and have fun. We had quite a few giggles in our office when we remembered this modern product, which was shown on our TV the previous night. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - many young people have never watched our movie ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or a peculiar feeling of "Tarantino-Spielberg" quality had not. Remember the scene when our roommate saves his friend, turns around, shoots, and goes to the bridge? Looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no sense or craft to make a better version of the novel, which has been properly screened once in our country. But I would like to see a Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind". Hey, directors, wake up and get busy, instead of our classic spoils. <br /> <br /> Back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though it is fatally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Trying to get foreign actors to pass for Russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a rude mistake and the filmmakers make this mistake again and again. Of course, this leads to numerous laughs - especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dance and singing makes a Russian viewer think, "It sucks so much that it's funny!"). To say something new, I would like to mention the pass of the movie. In my mind this new version is very lazy. The narrative and the screens don't flow naturally - they stumble and appear like a modern video. Again I have to remember our "Voyna i mir", where the action is so natural and the story is so easy you just go back and enjoy going with the flow. <br /> <br /> I thought maybe the Borodino battle would be good (somehow rehabilitating many drawbacks), but it seems to be no match for the war styles filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> There must still be good in this movie. And there is. The actors seem difficult to make it all work. They didn't have a chance from the start, but still joined the losers team. Plus 1 point for that recklessness. This makes a Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous even though they are meant to be dramatically powerful and the actors do their best. It makes everyone sorry, and sometimes - just laugh. <br /> <br /> What I like about this series is the last part of it. It shows very much how everyone gets his or her "salary and tax". Besides, judging by the movie performers, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the whole project. But fortunately, it does not have that rubbish. And that's a big plus. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter", and today, in today's Russia we do not have enough craft to film it properly. Should I say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated greatly? Fortunately, a proper film was screened during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - we haven't even existed yet. There were also excellent circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the beginning, 1 point goes for recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the series.) Thanks for the attention.
