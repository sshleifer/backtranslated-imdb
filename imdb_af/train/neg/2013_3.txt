This movie is about what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and (fairly easy) sex scenes! The movie is not sure what it wants to be and it almost ends a mess. It's more expensive than most of the directors Al Adamson's films, but it's not on the same level as viewers of scientific films expected. The actors are pretty bad and unlike most Adamson movies, there are no former big names or B actors. Some of the music is good, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
