Final Justice shot big Joe Don Baker running around Texas shooting people shooting people. Then he's off to Malta where he shoots more people. He is often locked up to shoot people. Then he gets a shooting fight with the bad man, dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don wakes up again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from Seinfeld, kills the bad man, blows a boat or two and shoots someone with a flare. All this and a catchy theme song, just like Mitchell!
