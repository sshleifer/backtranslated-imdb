This movie is nothing more than a religious channel that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age Occultism with Western images swallowed up by those who are ignorant of fundamental religious comparisons. Basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. Of course, some of the characters appear to be recognizable in the present time and also in the 1600s. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is Pantheism). Redfield tried to mix Eastern mysticism with Western Christianty. His attempt at syncretism can mislead or confuse those who do not seek the truth, but this movie is a poor excuse for any eventual reality. As the ad in the old Berkeley Barb said for $ 10.00, you'll show how to start your own religion. As one well-known prophet said, use Force Luke.
