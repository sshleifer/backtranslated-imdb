I wish I got more from this movie when I rented it. I'll put it in my queue based on Heather Graham and her strong actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt, undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people who think the sibs were a few. I don't care how big a part of the story line is, it still feels a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, doesn't look very much at signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (except her warmth and some common interests) that Grys had dropped for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who sometimes found her annoying), the cabbie in dress, and the dance series (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers, I wish we'd seen more of it, since the pieces what we showed was indeed better than most of the rest of the movie. Could have been better.
