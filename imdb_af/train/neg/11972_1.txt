The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really determine the direction most of this movie takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy who lives in New York in the 50's. He has a burning desire to see two people have sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his own mother and stepfather of course! How pleasant. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before he sees something and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife has sex. However, the woman is very pregnant and does not sleep together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging out a few girls. They have a small club where everything they do is talking about sex. The problem is ... it's not done in an innocent, charming 1950s kind of way. I'm not mean by ANY, but I found it quite disturbing listening to these kids talking about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. This kind of shyness may work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it just seems distorted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely wasted here as Hedy, a former bra model who becomes the object. of Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander should stay away from the director's seat as far as possible. "For Better or Worse" (1996) was terrible and now. What a waste. 10/01
