Mario Van Peebles appeared for less than five seconds. Glenn Plummer shows a little longer, but it is a ladies show all the way. Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye are in better projects. Bobby Brown teaches and mugs through his little time on the screen. This is how it is captured. Five tough women shoot and love the Wild Wild West. Celebrate black and one Asian. Oh, and Lil 'Kim is a sad and a heartbreaker and Marie Matiko can bring the Pacific rand market. We can shoot it for less than 15 million. Straight to video and we'll double, but probably we'll double our dollar. <br /> <br /> Greenlight the puppy. <br /> <br /> You did it.
