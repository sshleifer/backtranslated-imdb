Heavenly Days commits a serious comedy faux pas: desperate to teach us a civil lesson, and it won't stop before we've passed the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or if they did not), get a spit with their Senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career), knowledge make a bunch of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later he was regarded as a close communist push, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add in a few really horrible musical moments, a whole bunch of rolling hayey, and a boring sub-plot of newspaper reporters, and you have a movie that Philip Wylie needs to get ready for Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically tireless, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has all the best songs.
