This story about three women is a very sensitive study of: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde), the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the eldest mother of Muriel. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriel comes from a town and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so you are waiting for something - in case of an accident - that can dramatize this story. As time goes on, you discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case, so there is a sense of emptiness.
