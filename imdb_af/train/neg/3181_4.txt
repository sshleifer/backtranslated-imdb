This movie is not made by Who fans. Most of the wonderful moments that fans in the half-hour Tommy Medley will look forward to are simply missed or shining: At Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams. "Tommy doesn't know what day it is." They showed almost * no * Townsend guitar shots in Pinball wizard. There was excess crowd at the best moments of Going to the Mirror, and worst of all. In the second half we will not take it to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's flashy guitar chords. Large pieces of the film are shot from behind in the band. It's a very frustrating movie to watch, and doesn't deliver the goods. I don't know if director Murry Lerner is just not a fan, or worse, at least for him, than he * A Who is, and it's all * eight * cameras that can deliver to him. For his credit, there are a few scarce numbers for Tommy, as well as some faves, which are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. It may be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you don't expect Tommy. The sound in general was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV; This may be different on video or DVD.
