Alas, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Every day, at 2:00, they fly Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was "Going back to the cabin at the lake" the movie that was broadcast yesterday. I'm sorry to look at it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regular popular low budget and it was well accepted. The problem is that this successor is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and trying to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all sentences of the word. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a soap opera on some points because it is absurd dialogue, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre movies. <br /> <br /> You're warned.
