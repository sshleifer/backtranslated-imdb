This movie looks promising, but it was pretty bad. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they couldn't rise above the average spirit of this tough college movie. Jason Schwartzman was again very annoying - even more so in Rushmore, the rest of the cast was rather unsatisfactory. Screens that had to be fun were inappropriate and incredibly young. Try to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but fail at all levels. A total waste of everyone's time.
