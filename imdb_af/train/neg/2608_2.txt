My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repeat of the things of 101 Dalmatians. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The best part was the credits at the beginning - they were nice and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thank you.
