This is surely one of the worst movies ever made. Every scene is painful. You will be on the thin attempts at humor, the awkward camera work, the sexism and racism, the ridiculous story line, the woodworking Weak Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the movie that is not embarrassing. In everything, scary.
