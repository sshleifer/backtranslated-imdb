What happens if you give a free man enough money to catch him in the rock and fight him? Homeless people don't answer anyone. They have no mortgages, lease payments or idiot base. Homeless people do not have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But just give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they need to worry about the gearbox, buying gas for transportation, paying their car insurance, and working for someone else. They get a chance to be a "productive citizen". This movie was about as exploitative as a movie could be. It's a way for the rich and middle-class sheep to say "see what happens if you try to help the poor?" and it justifies capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a movie that asks, "What happens if you take away everything a rich man has?"
