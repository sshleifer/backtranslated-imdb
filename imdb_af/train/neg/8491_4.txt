Despite some occasional original touches, such as the "virtual sets" that provide the backdrop for Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film falls short and eventually disappointed. Newcomer Francesca Faridany looks talented, but is wasted as Emmy, a character that is reduced to nothing more than watching a monitor while Lady Ada tells an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' briefly takes off when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; The camera departs on her facial expressions, ways, which even make her translucent or instant invisible, which is divided into scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" version of her. <br /> <br /> A straightforward biography of Ada Lovelace would have been worth it, but this movie unfortunately has a wealth of both Lady Ada's life and that of a modern computer scientist (and her broad-minded, doltish boyfriend).
