Oh god, what a horrible, horrible movie. Means to be a comment about the state of society, it is just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality TV. Interstitials presented by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most unpleasant part, written in a tone that is possibly reflective and informative. These moments are rather over when they talk to the camera with a dialogue written by someone with a love of abusive, derogatory speech that kicks the "meaning" of the movie under the viewer's throat. <br /> <br /> Also, a point to filmmakers: Long time and quiet scenes are not equal to art. Neither did extreme angles or logic stretch to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please do not. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
