I didn't expect much when I saw the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. Yet I expressed hope. It sounds a bit like "Bride and Bias" (L.A. old falls for an Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P wasn't perfect, but it was a nice movie with some good laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" didn't have any of these. The acting was standing and was a way to get to the numbers. Characters were so clich√© the story looked as if it could be written by the high school socialist drama student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. There seemed to be a lot of over-dialogue. I mean a lot. I know sometimes it's necessary, but it sounded like half of the movie was shot in a cupboard and it became very distracting. <br /> <br /> Two stars are slightly yellow.
