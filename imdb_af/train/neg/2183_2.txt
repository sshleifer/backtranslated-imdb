This movie was really bad either as a sci-fi movie, an abomination or even a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie seems (and is) cheap, the actors have no idea what is going on and the writing clearly shows that it was made with the shooting. Obviously the monster was added to the cupboard because the living head was not scary at all. She was even beautiful - and they thought they needed something more impressive; They also failed here (the make-up is even for the late 50's, quite funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why director Joseph Green's career as such and as a writer never realized; He was really bad at both. The same goes for the actors, leading and supporting. <br /> <br /> "The brain that would not die" is its best performance shortly.
