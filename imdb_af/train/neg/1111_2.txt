The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, this is all the positive I can say about this Western movie. I still have to write 8 lines for my comments to be posted, but there are more than 8 lines of horrible in this western. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a spoof. The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. Not realistic. Many of the supporting actors in this movie seem authentic, but the shooting scene was a joke. A previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the commentary came a cheap shot at President Bush. It was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially. I wonder if it made money. Sometimes I thought I watched a movie watched by college film students. If so, it was a good movie.
