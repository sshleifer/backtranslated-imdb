Howling II (1985) was a full 180 from the first film. While the first movie was champion and creepy. The second one was sloppy and cheesy. The production values ​​on this one are pretty bad and the play is horrible. The brother of the anchor woman was wolf of part one wanting to find out what happened to his sis. The "scene" of the first film was badly recreated. A skinny, flat-looking woman accompanies bro (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to expose the mystery to her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee occasionally appears and disappears as a guide for the two. Sybil Danning and her two largest assets appear to be Stirba, Romania's main wolf. She also suffers from a bad case in the morning, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprised Philippe Mora directs this picture because he's usually a good movie maker. The movie is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content, but the movie inventory itself). To round off the movie from you, get a mean "punk" show from a Lost Wannabe "Babel". Perhaps if they dropped a few extra money, they could get the right deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> Best to avoid unless you are desperate or you have lost the distance and you're too lazy to change the channel.
