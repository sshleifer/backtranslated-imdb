Thank God! I didn't waste my money, but I downloaded it! It happens to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, f ***** g visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Distant from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many loopholes and bugs in the movie. If you have time after reading this comment, please check out the director's profile (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I get a self-explanation, why the movie is like that, every movie that regulates Ulli Lommel gets a score of 1 to 2. And now I'm not willing to search what kind of movies it is aimed at, but I can finish it all by saying one strong sentence. Even having fun or time or even in a very bored situation, MUST NOT BE THIS MOVIE.
