I found it on the shelf while I was home and bored. How can people possibly give it a 10? It's not just that it's supposed to be a feeling of good salvation film, because it doesn't work at that level either. Poor plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; There is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but has nothing to do with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just awful. The plot progression (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) doesn't make sense. The authors seem to want the plot to go some way and make it without writing the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only half an hour, but it's 90 minutes of your life, you'll never come back.
