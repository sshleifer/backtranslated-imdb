So, Steve Irwin. You must admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that is clearly filled with crocus, snakes, lizards, tons of the above-mentioned reptiles, and mud, not just daily, but with enthusiasm. He could never do this, but he managed to make his wife close. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fall into my parallel film category universe - the movies for people who just had their teeth drilled, have a migraine, or have no movie experience and therefore they love quiet mediocrity (currently populated by Disney movies). This is too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He is always so happy and would cut through the blasse teenager (I can hear it now: "that movie was so STOP") or the Tylenol with codeine. I want to say his enthusiasm is catching up, but if it were, I'd have a room full of snakes, and that hasn't happened yet. I agreed they were beauty, but I still don't pet them. <br /> <br /> Plot was indeed predictable. Bad guys were so bad, for a moment there I thought I was at an electronic supermarket. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, so I watched it. That plot (if you could call it) was really more of a reason to throw another bump in a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way. <br /> <br /> I was hoping there would be a sequel to Steve and Terri (with their acting worked) a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can't believe we'll see Steve any more. I hope Terri and the kids will still be involved in the Australian Zoo and the Discovery Channel. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having a member of the Irwin family, and telling me how wonderful that crocodile is. Crikey!
