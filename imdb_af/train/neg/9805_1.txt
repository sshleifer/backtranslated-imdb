I never understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers show. It was simply a second time American version of Japan's ultra-popular super centai series of the past three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that power stations are the biggest, but they will be wrong. /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they'd learn how much better Super Sentai is about the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are quite terrible, try Super Sentai earlier! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
