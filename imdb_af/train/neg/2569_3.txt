Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is gently amusing in this 1970's turkey, but the writing is so lame and insulting that even the Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar victory) can't pull this one out of the mud no. As a dressmaker in his 40's, Sellers mostly sells him to the ninth grade. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young type of study. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers are well paid because I don't see another reason for a trip in 1970 (a good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE , WUSA, FIVE easy points and many others). You can't win everyone!
