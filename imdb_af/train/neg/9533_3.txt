A text prologist warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house, but I think the more pleasant word is "entropy". George, Seymour Cassell, is alone in his San Francisco office and his exceptionally expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke like Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on his door and ask for directions. Well, it's raining, and they shiver like two drenched cowardly kittens, and they're not sure of the address they're looking for, and what about one thing and another, George invites them to come in and take part in his pizza by the fire. All three occur in George's bath and there are about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure and dodecuple exposure. They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls make him breakfast. But something has been cut slightly because Georgie's guests grab everything with their fingers and throw ketchup and syrup over the linen and - "you eat like animals!" George calls out and tells them to come out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary blonde young blonde with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp is jumping like a super ball. You have to say that they are breeding a very cute cute brother in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they also breed with sticks, because we can't help but after the first five or ten minutes. /> <br /> But when the girls go berserk, so does the movie. The film is then bathed in a green green light. The pair have ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces on themselves in the mirrors. They brain a delivery boy and then press him to make sure. They erected a storm and hit windows and furniture. They had one of those scenes in which two people sat across the table, licking food and then jumping one another's legs. <br /> <br /> And Georgia? They make Georgie unconscious with mace (which doesn't contain anything you can't get in that little red bottle of McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cupboard), binds it, pours flour and milk all over it, submits it to a psychotic trial, Put him through one of the Tolstoy-type semi-retrenchments, slap him around, pull him off in foreign costumes, then hit him and his virtually destroyed middle class, and be sent by an ex machina delivery partner. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, somebody told Georgie, "First of all, to these girls, and then panic after being tied up." And for the girls, "First of all, ashamed, unwilling to lay anyone up, then you must be mad." And that's it. <br /> <br /> Photography and location work is straight from a 1970s porn movie. I'm not sure it represents a total lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to make San Francisco ugly. The score gives us two Leitmotivs. Georgie's are a few pop-stamp with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in." Jackson and Donna's is a catchy rinky thing called "My Good Old Father." <br /> <br /> However, I accept the moral lesson behind the story. There are a few things that you simply should not give, although they may seem like a lot of fun. Everything very educational.
