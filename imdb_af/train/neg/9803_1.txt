The generators are definitely the worst television program and totally ridiculous plastic stick in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing that even remotely entertains about this totally horrible television program. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst performance ever made, with horrible actors, dressing in multi-colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, as there is no redeeming value for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today's kids should try to look at better performances like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.
