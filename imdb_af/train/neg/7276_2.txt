You can call this one a flop, and it's also great! Quality is not associated with the words National Lampoon, but the entries for vacation and animal shelter were at least fun, but so far this feature should be their most functional feature. Ugh! The three-piece story attempts to parody the clich√©s and stereotypes that Hollywood genre films have flooded, which seems to be indecent and dreary. <br /> <br /> "Grow yourself." - Jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and divorce his wife so they can both grow and do what they always wanted to do. It is life, as Jason sees it, and he takes the children into consideration, but his decision to follow this path may not be the right one. <br /> <br /> Talk about the lead, boring and stiff. There is only real interest in the small show of the beautiful Diane Lane. The satirical element here seems to point out something rather than just delivering it. The silly humor is tense, flat and particularly pointless. Peter Riegert plays a very deadly role in the lead role and Teresa Ganzel bubble in her role. <br /> <br /> "Success managers". After completing only collage, Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and is raped with a little butter by the Dairy Company Presidents. For the repayment she is interested in the margarine industry and she is immediately working on the 'top'. <br /> <br /> Probably the best one of the three, but the competition wasn't too big. Want to be more subtle with his sexual and power-oriented tone, but still feel more sticky and forced. The idea has something promising and resourceful to build on, but the bumpy pacing starts to wear out at the end and the disastrous dialogue does not try The humor tries, but often does not matter, despite the hunger. The tempting Ann Dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout (good after the painful ordeal) and likes gracefully bald, it's quite a bit even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story. Jumping into amusing minor cameos ranged from Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and a favorite turn by Joe Spinell. <br /> <br /> "Municipalities" - a series of murderers who leave copies of his driver's license after every murder, are traced by an enthusiastic naive vegetable head and his old grizzled partner. The young police, however, learn that trouble is the only way to go when the two meet one after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yes. Certainly if you want to spoof a lot of things at the top of the game, make sure the laughs run down. Obviously they forgot it! Even on his 30 minute run, drag the boy on it! Robbie Benson's stirring performance has become somewhat tolerable with a tired Richard Widmark who does very little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd subscribes to the role of a serial killer, but his spicy, cruel and sympathetic performance works well and shows the other clues almost. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When the jokes come, they really feel out of synchronization and are quite surprised at the repetition of the fun of these cop cliches. <br /> <br /> Overall, the idiotic material attached to his sketches comes across as disposable. the unbearable writing is basically inactive and relentless. Only one or two few gags make it out of every segment, but really there are too many cheap stinkers or regular dung that stuck in your head. This is because it almost becomes what it is trying to make fun and it basically shows in every story. It was lost. The performances range from warm to cold, but that can't deny the embarrassment that most of their faces feel. Director Bob Giraldi's first taste is a vapid for "Growing Yourself", but "Success Wanters" have some small flourishes of soft efficiency. Henry Jaglom is working on "municipalities". Rick Meyerowitz's spectacular drawings, which open the film, are neatly designed and continue to add style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-brown comedy flunks it by overlaying it, with the main interest of the well-known cameos. But really, it's worth going through this awkward lame and restless rise, just to see them. Well, it's up to you.
