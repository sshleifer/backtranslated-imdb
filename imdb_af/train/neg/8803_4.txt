I loved "Anchorman, the legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped it would be just as funny, but unfortunately it wasn't. Some pieces are excellent. I thought the sportsman, Champ Kind, who emphasized his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team, was hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he just gets louder and louder and eventually lures Burgundy, which is also not recognized. But on the whole left the story. However, it is a beautiful attempt to save the unused pieces of the first movie, including a whole plot of some benign, domestic terrorists called the alarm clock. Saturday Night Live Maya Rudolph is one of the members and has some funny lines, but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. The extras on this disc are pretty good, with the best two being the filmed rehearsals with many improved comedies. The faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an exec producer who discovered Ferrell early was not even part of the movie. any way, shape or form. It appears he is a man who has walked into the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. However, these are a few funny things and last for about 10 or 15 minutes
