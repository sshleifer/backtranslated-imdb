A wonderful example of how Hollywood (and still can) make a masterpiece of literary fiction and ignore it stupidly. <br /> <br /> In the case of the Big Sky, author Dudley Nichols and their company arrogantly assume that they can improve on a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer Prize winner, AB Guthrie. This removes the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have as a movie adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of his main character, Boone Caudill, From a naive, Kentucky pupil to a hardy and capable survivor / mountain man, was replaced by a truncated river boat. -farce that seems little like the author's intention. In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing but understatement. <br /> <br /> Introductory and even shocking platinum elements that give Guthrie's new impact and excitement are eliminated for no apparent reason. The most confused of all is the emphasis on the Seb Calloway character, who was a casual, small character in the book, covering only a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, is completely wrong! It is also clear that director Hawks did not irritate the Zeb character in the movie, which was played by actor Hunnicutt. So Zeb / Hunnicutt gave a considerable amount of time to do that unnecessary, voice-over story, which is the Hollywood cut for incompetent writing magazines, editing and direction. <br /> <br /> Some movies actually improved on the books they were based on (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is an excellent example). But it is horrible and depressed not only as an adaptation of a novel, but as a movie for itself. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and split, and the characters - at least the one not worked out of writing - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas's star appeal, which could be helped to lift this movie, was cut by the milktoast role he was given. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the movie version of Guthrie's Pulitzer Prize winner, "The Way West," which Kirk also expects, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" strengthens Howard Hawks' place beyond one of the most overstated, lucrative directors in the history of the theater.
