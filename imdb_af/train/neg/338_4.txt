Definitely one of the funny Eddie Murphy's smaller films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three-hundred-year-old dragons and a chosen one. <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "Chosen One" in issue, and if The opening song indicates that he is "the best man in the world". A searcher of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him that he is the "Chosen One" and that it is his fate to find and save the "Golden Child". For if the child die, compassion would die with him, as he is merciful. <br /> <br /> If all this hocus pocus junk doesn't ruin it for you now, it'll surely start the movie. Possible to say the plot is horrible and destroys the whole movie. He wants to be another vehicle for Murphy's selfish sense of humor (the comedy isn't that good), the movie fails at many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can't do much for proceedings. Very stupid and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
