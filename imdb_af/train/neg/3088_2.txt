1. Aliens look like soft toys and puppets while having arms that don't work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens master intergalactic space travel, but they don't know how to open an open safe by opening, but can keep a door locked by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Old security guards know how to get a hold of C4, and just wait at the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, the US Army Boat Camp involved various "gardening tools" sessions in the 80's, including the pirouette spin of death. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your cheerful girl friend, you need to "save the world ... err ... neighborhood" from strangers. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are closed, either openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Scummy nightclubs look like bad dinners. <br /> <br /> 8. "Scummy" waitresses double as dancers for the Fontanelles (how did they talk about this?) What can only do bad 60's dance moves. <br /> <br /> 9. Army-privates dream to be Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. Grenades apparently has a "flash-bang" setting. <br /> <br /> 11. To be burned alive, only one with slight burns on their arms appears. <br /> <br /> 12. US Army Staff Sargeants seem to always be in the area and do nothing about strangers in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens seem to always "go home", which means returning to the safe where they were unlocked. <br /> <br /> 14. Aliens are attracted to bright lights, which apparently mean in the Los Angeles area one would assume, the chief's home is the brightest thing in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking screens in a movie makes the audience more frightened. <br /> <br /> 16. Vans from the 80's apparently have terrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. Comedy is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 18. Horror must happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. Bobs and homages are supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 20. This movie cures insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, gardening tools make electronic keyboard sounds when used, not just in fighting (tell me, I'm not the only one who noticed it). <br /> <br /> The only truth is this movie just came out wrong. Period. There is not much meat on the bone, and nothing really does good. Even average. It's just bad. However, I have seen much worse, and the rake battle scene is pure comedy gold, deliberate or otherwise. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than that. At least the film never took him seriously.
