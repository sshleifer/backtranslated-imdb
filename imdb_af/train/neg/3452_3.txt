I have chosen to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was selected for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious competition section. I was surprised that Cannes could be so far from the point of judging quality. <br /> <br /> The film, some reviewers, has not seen too much gunfire, but its inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor before your young boy ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are a few tips from the contrasting Corleone boys in Copolla's "Godfather" who are here in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, but the quality of the two is as clear as lime and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for violators. There's not a big movie here. In the best case, it is considered better than the regular Run Run Shaw production value production.
