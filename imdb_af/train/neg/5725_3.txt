2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel and in 2006 we gave Live Feed; a not so decent rip-off from the Hostel. Live Feed follows exactly the same formula as Eli Roth's previous movie, except this time the stupid kids in Asia are rather than Central Europe. The plot focuses on these stupid children, and one of them has irritated one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The residents decide to close them all in a theater and kill them. Despite having heard less favorable things about this movie before I saw it, I still hoped it could be at least half decent, because director Ryan Nicholson previously had the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge movie Torched 'made. but this movie just falls because most of them are ridiculous or boring. Of course, the movie goes back to the good old days of the Grindhouse theater (which Hostel did, successfully), but it doesn't really matter. Surprisingly, since Nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even the gore is impressive. Although it's much better than the acting! There's not much else I can say about this movie ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
