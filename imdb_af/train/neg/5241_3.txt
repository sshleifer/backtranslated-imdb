Say the truth, I'm a little over seeing all these positive reviews by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decided to watch this movie. And after I saw it, I was really disappointed, and it comes from the man who loves this genre of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm completely surprised at this movie - it's like a kid's movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involves little kids who curse and curse. I'm not fair at all, but it's really too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Summary: The story of two guys sent to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. There they met with one child with an obsession with boobs and the other was a medieval freak. <br /> <br /> Only the name itself is not really linked to the story. They are not a role model or nothing but their time for what they did. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And didn't we see all the same characters (playing by Mc Lovin ') in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and almost slept. <br /> <br /> Well, the casting was good, he is the one who made the script. And the acting is as expected as you watch this type of movie. And the direction, what do you expect? It's the same man who brought our Nat Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in a star to attract his horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, I didn't feel a total riff, but a total waste of time. Only the bare screens seem to be the best part in the movie. Can't really see any point why I recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Not funny, terrible story, nudity and kids do not interfere. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
