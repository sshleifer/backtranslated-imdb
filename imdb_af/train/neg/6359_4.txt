Woody Allen, at his best, has one of the sharpest pens around. He can make an acute observation and turn it into a punch line like no other. But when he is at its worst, his films can smell of pretentiousness. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have this stench from opening to closing. The setup is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while. Four friends sit in a restaurant and discuss whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help establish the argument, one man starts the story and asks the other two offenders (one drama playwright, the other a dramatic playwright) or the story a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story and the film plays out the stories they are weaving. Now, when I first heard of this movie, my understanding was that they were telling exactly the same story. The genre (comedy or drama) just changes by how you see it. Now it would have been interesting. However, the stories only share one main element and some elements. They are completely different stories with great plot differences. The drama is so well written and pretentious that it can only work as self-parody. If that was the point, it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and brief. Of course, Farrell would be meant to be Woody, but he could have played this more credible character without adding Woody's shorts and handcuffs. Woody is best to be Woody. When someone else tries, they don't play a character, they form a recognizable actor. This type of thing just pulls the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen movies leave me a little bit lighter in the mind than I entered. This one made me wish I could get my money back
