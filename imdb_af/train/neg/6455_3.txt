Really a horrible movie. However, this can be expected. Clearly a low budget: nothing innovative, an actress (if you can mention what she's doing, "acting") who always has a nudity in a landfill, has a man in a reptile suit almost modeled on predator, a cabin in the woods, etc. But there are some salvation points. Although the story is not new, for the most part there are a few parts that are not being traced back. For one, the black man does not die when he is attacked (the first time) and he is not even one of the first couple to die. But it's a minor. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on Kat's experiments and West & Steve I didn't see. When Steve told Kat he knew what she was doing, I believed what he had said and what Kat had answered. But when the being revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation. This may be due to my lack of experience with the genre, or it's a really clever turn. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty bad and doesn't look like something better ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi movie.
