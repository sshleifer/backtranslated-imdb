end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover, but is warned its bad. A big fan of mega-star actor Christopher Lee was my fool. Like tentacles (77), a good role doesn't mean it will be a good movie. The start looks promising, then it becomes tedium, many parts of the film are too dark to see what's going on. The rest of the roll is shown. briefly like: Lewes, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as a security guard. I would expect better from Charles band who made good pictures like the re-animator and dolls. I heard that Christopher Lee was made in this movie. He said his stars Jose Ferrer, John Carridine and Dean Jagger will be. Well, dean Jagger is there, but the other two never made it happy. If you make a film about the end of the world, use a bigger budget and better storyline. Jagger then did two good movies, alligator (80) and the game of death (79) suing Lyon (Lolita) also in the movie minus her lollipop. If you're a glutton for punishment, watch the end of The World over which I dare wake up during the whole movie.1 out of 10.
