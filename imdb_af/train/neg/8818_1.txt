Stupid and just plain strange film about a child being traumatized when he finds out Santa, isn't really (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of people who are naughty or beautiful. One Christmas, he snaps and kills the naughty people - of course dressed as Santa. <br /> <br /> Boring and just bad killer Santa movie. If you're looking for Gore, it's not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and they are not sorry for many false effects. Most of the movie contains only Brandon Maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy. The script is thin, the play is terrible and it ends up making me stare at the TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and see it again to make sure I wasn't hallucinating! Really VERY weak end. <br /> <br /> If you want a horrible Christmas movie rental "Black Christmas" (the original 70s version - NOT the terrible remake). Avoid this one at all costs.
