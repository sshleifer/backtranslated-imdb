It has Christopher Lee, it has large shores of 1970s computers that make Teletype sounds, because letters are displayed on the screen. It has radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark, but emit vibrating sounds, it has volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! Tidal waves! earthquakes! explosive cars! explode coffee machines! And as a climax the whole planet jumps up. How on earth did this movie succeed so incredibly, annoyingly DULL? The answer, my friend, is because 90% of this movie consists of shooting shots, most of which include tracks, pans or zoom in combinations, or sometimes all three, that do nothing, except that the crew must do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, driving in and out of cars, driving again, looking around, watching things, driving and driving ... I just sat there looking at endless parade of nothing in relentlessness. "Say something, please. Someone, just say something ... DO NOW ... ANY! ..." <br /> <br /> The dialogue, when it comes, is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Perhaps their minutes are being measured at a different scale from ours." was a typically meaningless line. The text culminates in the destruction of the world by stock, justified in this Lee's main alien speech: <br /> <br /> "Planet Earth has poured out an abundance of diseases, infecting the universe planets will suffer from light from here if not destroyed! "<br /> <br /> This is the Neanderthal SF writing script. This is the kind of motivation you capture in the 1950's Japanese monster packs on 7-year-olds. That is, and I am collecting such things, the most divine line of an English SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. It bugs believe this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who always hit me as a clever, helpful actor with some knowledge of his boundaries, delivers his lines as if he were killing his agent to get him into this hope. I don't blame him.
