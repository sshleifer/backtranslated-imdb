No? Don't think so! Well, all you have to do is far, far away from "Want to know a secret," because it's just the umpteenth pointless post-scream slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. The plot is extremely ridiculous; The characters are stupid, the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this movie is mainly inspired by "I still know what you did last summer", as the events occur in a similar environment and the killer's motivation is equally stupid. Why anyone who wants to steal ideas of junk like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery to me anyway. At least the movie can depend on the precious stretch of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls in this litter, apart from mindless, are also extremely unattractive. A year after the unresolved murder of her boyfriend, her new cute lover, Beth Morgan, and her four other simple students go to Florida to spend their spring vacation in a fine beach house. The murderer did not make a move all year round, but now he is following the post to Florida and starting to kill, leaving the titular message as a kind of business card. You really don't have to be a horror expert to quickly find out which face is hiding behind the indescribable ridiculous mask and the writers' efforts to put you on the wrong track are really embarrassing. As the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant, including the subplots of the incompetent Floridian police force and the 'mysterious' FBI inspector who apparently has a personal score to settle. The murder inexplicably goes off the screen (don't hate it if it does?), There's not even a free T&A to enjoy, and you can't better start the dialogue. By suffering such a fool, you just realize that the beautiful spirit of the 80's slides is gone.
