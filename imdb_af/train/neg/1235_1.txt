I was really looking to see the planet of the monkeys, but it was a great dissapointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are great, but it's the only good thing about the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg doesn't work, he's just in the movie, look stupid. The other actors aren't very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst point of all is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example, the monkeys are unconsciously lying on the ground, but the people don't attack them, no, they wait until they come up again! This is just one example for the stupid story, but it will take too long to tell them all.
