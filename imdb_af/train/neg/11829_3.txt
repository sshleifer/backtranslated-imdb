I wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute "Borat" and left disappointed tonight. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and will be watching animation movies on a regular basis. That said, I cut myself and barely walked at one point, but waiting for this movie to get better. Never happened before. <br /> <br /> The footage is beautiful and the voice work is, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a few times about the bullet head band Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is that it is one of those animated features for the ADD set. It registers after the fact that a zany slapstick routine after another, delivered by a treacle filled plot that pulls each stop in an attempt to get an "important message." It looks a lot like an Oscar for the animated category, and given the way it is with critics, I won't be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers its hardware. But if you're looking for a nice animated feature on rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
