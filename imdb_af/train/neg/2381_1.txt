I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is something to go. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, and that was why I first experienced this experience. A horrible movie with only the music as a redeeming quality. It's just a shame that we're unable to give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
