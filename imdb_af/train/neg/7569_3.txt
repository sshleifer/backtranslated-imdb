It certainly fits in the time as the action and allies play espionage games throughout North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of movies, but certainly not the worst of the budget films described earlier in the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed Harry Parke's performance (credited as Parkyarkus). Why he never had more roles is beyond me. He played the perfect partner / partner and saved the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As said, this movie was part of a Superbox-Mart budget package entitled War Classics. Eight dollar movies included other never-heard movies, which have a few decent stars to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. The editing and cinematography is ... worse. If you can convey it all and want to see the future Cisco Kid & a good sidekick that unfortunately never achieved its true potential, you should definitely get it! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
