It is fascinating to me that so many judges consider it a masterpiece. I'm not a dullard as far as quality movies go, and I agree that the movie is a technical filming stance as well as several of the characters portrayed in an award-winning class. But there is no sense (to me) of this movie actually going; I mean, take the viewer everywhere. It's a series of mind-sets, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more of a movie. I'm looking for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival, of which I haven't found in this film. Yes, it can be considered poems on film. . . but there is a lot of poetry that I cannot attend for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> One thing to say further is that it documents an English childhood of the mid-century, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally shocked by what a young British boy had to go through, at that time and place. Having grown up in America a decade earlier, I can say that the contrast is great. I can't help wondering if this contrast had any effect on those who reviewed the film so favorably. In other words, can there be a tendency to completely judge the film on its 'cinematic magic' (which I acknowledge there is) and ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of the actual recalled experience?
