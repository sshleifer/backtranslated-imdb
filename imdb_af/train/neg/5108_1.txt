I can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tearful. For one it is quite unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives to their new homes. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to support these new mega homes? And what about their poor neighbors? Property tax should surely increase after it has happened. Plus, the noise will irritate me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how excessive can a reality television program become? This is almost the same repetitive litter week after week. We were introduced to a family of suffering, they made the house, then surprised the family and all broke out the Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how boring the refurbishment component is. The only interesting part of the show is to see how the house looks, but even the segment is destroyed by the evil confessioners and constantly sighing. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a performance pretending to be warm, but it falls flat. Skip this one. If you like reality television, Survivor is much better and moving.
