A hint I think can be gathered through the various comments on this thread. <br /> <br /> I was rather surprised at the number of people who wanted this movie, which made it "compulsory" or "compulsory". </ br /> <br /> I think this gives us some insight into why this film and its underlying subject matter polarize. <br /> <br /> The Global Warming case matters to people who want to force others to "do right". This is especially true of more "liberal" leaning people because it does not have to do with bedroom morality which usually gets conservatives who want to force you to go well. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one to it. He can't help insisting on those who want to force others to do what they want. The political appeal is just too great. <br /> <br /> And we are left with a scientific issue that can be of great importance, reduced to a political issue that is attractive to those in body politics with a love of forcing others to get right do. <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how was the Environmental Movement hijacked by such people?
