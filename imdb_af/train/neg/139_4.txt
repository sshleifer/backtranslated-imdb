This movie was hired by a friend. Her choice is usually good. I first read the cover and expected a good movie. Although it was <br /> <br /> a horror movie. What I don't prefer. But there was no horror in mind while watching the movie. It was a boring <br /> <br /> not very entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was once again a pleasure to the eye. But that's it. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> We are a little disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> judge it yourself.
