This man has no idea of ​​theater. Well, it looks like he has made some interesting plays in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that have successfully had more political reasons for deceiving the communist censorship. All this is very good, but look carefully: he knows she doesn't work! The screens are unbalanced, without proper start and, with disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he speaks violence, nudity and gut language. How is it possible to keep such a rotten body that has no understanding of cinematographic profession and art? Why don't they give him a piece?
