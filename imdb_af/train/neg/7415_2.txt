What do you call a horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> It's the most annoying thing about the movie: I get the feeling that the authors never really decided what was really going on! It's another thing to know about it, give tips for the audience and not completely reveal it, but here you get the feeling that the writers don't know it, characters in the movie don't know it and hear that no one knows! (Remember "Cube"? Even that movie knew more about himself.) <br /> <br /> I have consumed many 80's horror / gore movies and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those movies. But many important things are missing. We really don't know anything about the characters. They are still repeating empty lines over and over. The story doesn't really develop - it never goes anywhere. B-play is OK in these horror movies, but there's not much to do in writing. We don't care about the characters. There is nothing to remember from them. There is not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no excitement, no cold fever. <br /> <br /> You just get some commonly used elements of the horror movie genre. They show the Herei monsters one by one, but their characters don't really give anything to the story. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with minimal crew and equipment. Oh yes, filmmakers did it - and more - about 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience when the film ended. Really really.
