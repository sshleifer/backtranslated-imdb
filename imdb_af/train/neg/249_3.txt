See this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was scary as Scrooge, but the rest of the role-playing fails so much. Sometimes I can't stop laughing at the stupid scene and the repeated line: "Merry Christmas for everyone!" Other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a short story by Charles Dickens about a rich man, who doesn't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich man is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate Christmas. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how this movie, with a script so bad, had to be written in five. minutes can be rated so well. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend you the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. It was at least funny ...
