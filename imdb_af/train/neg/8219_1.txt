I am the kind of person who always goes 2 to the horror section when I choose a movie, so I chose five eyes, I was disgusting for this movie and thought there was no story line and no point you could enjoy it, it crawled my skin to think that people want to see movies that only encourage violence for hell, it was low budget and lots of junk! I think I can improve better. I think it was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and you shouldn't bother to see it. The actors were rubbish. The camera was terrible. The picture was bad and the sound wasn't too tight. I think it was a bit like a fine rip of the baler projecting and it didn't work at all, it was dirty.
