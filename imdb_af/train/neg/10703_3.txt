but Thomas Ian Griffith just did not grant the Polish, which has a big dollar actor, it was made 5+ years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been to make it not just action but comedy. And how do you get KC from Katia Koslovska anyway? Plummer's character was so thin, he'd better fit in a Bullwinkle. Personally, if action planes will appear skin - I'd like to see equal time between woman / man, otherwise nothing will show.
