Unfortunately, this movie has no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly timid as far as actors, embeds the screen with a variety of skills from, unplowed to top. The supporting role is not better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains much the same as the original in terms of stage aggression, but is much worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Unbelief cannot be suspended, nor can it be doubted. The only saving aspect of this movie is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whoever is investigated should be praised for the place. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and several angry, literally at the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, throw a whiskey and enjoy.
