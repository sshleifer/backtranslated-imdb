We rented five movies for New Year's Eve weekend and watched this one first. All I can say is that there was no room to go, but after watching this one. It was senseless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's writing should have been easy to write - just make two out of every three words a swear word. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good at a character role, but the movie has nothing else to recommend.
