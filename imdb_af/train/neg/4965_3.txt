For such a great classic story, the environment (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script for dramatic tension. The club story column is useful and would have given a new approach to literary classics. For some strange reason, the column was dropped early. Knowing it was shot in 21 days, tell me, "rushed" and it shows unhappy. Now we have to wait on the big screen for the Hollywood version. I get on FX, I can really tolerate CGI, but the writing must rock and this one was just too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I'll blame it on the actors, but ... since I know more than I do, I'll pick my colleague.
