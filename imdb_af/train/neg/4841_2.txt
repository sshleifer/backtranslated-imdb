REALLY ??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the glowing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is a great pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would have laughed out loud, and many, but was on a date with a former military man. I couldn't hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat old, good old boy, likes it. It's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work .... Fine for the other. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful plague from Ralph. I just agree a 2 because Ralph SO SO IS. But I have to plead, Ralph, how can you? And why ?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to look at the end of the case to heal and repair now. C1
