I will admit that I may have seen five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I don't see myself as a snob, but I really think I'm looking at what is at his show. You must try to elevate yourself above. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social studies event that I was doing. I was told that this movie had little to do with Springer himself, but rather on the lives of those who would appear at Springer. Handle better, this movie could actually be a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives really are. I would admit that I had a doctrine of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all she has in life. How sad she feels she must go on Jerry's show to fix it. <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan who appears here. Did you notice that she was mainly referred to B-roles on TV after this movie? I'll tell you about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she has a lot of seriousness in her acting and she tries to play her roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan can't carry a scene himself. She just doesn't need to play a leading role. Her best work will always be Angel at Herman's Head (a show that wasn't good, but his heart was in the right place) and when she walked into Seinfeld as Sister Roberta.
