Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This steaming stack of donkey tail is a perfect case in the point; It makes "the violent years" like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards's worst flashback look like my first nightly release. I had nightmares, you know awake and glide bullets, which will never come close to the visceral terror, that Santa Claus was excavated from the seemingly pure ground of my being. However, I can think of some parties where this movie can actually go well. Also, if you are looking for the perfect example of a Santa Satan digotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Do not check this movie as I was notified that the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here is the "Santa Claus".
