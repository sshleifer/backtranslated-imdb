Not long enough to be feature length and not suddenly enough, this thing exists for some reason, to have a lesbian triple. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that it could make a decent feature length movie. Misty looks after her outfit and is a very chubby girl and when people have such a game character, like Lara Croft, that they make nude calendars from her, you know that a soft flick explodes. Unfortunately, it's pretty pathetic. Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand, rubs air. Watch it if you just can't get enough of Misty or Ruby, which makes a pretty blonde and has the sea.
