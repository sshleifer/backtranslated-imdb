This movie is so stupid, it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I actually wanted to see "Darkness Falls" and thought it was the movie. Son, what a mistake! I transferred as much as possible and still I couldn't get rid of the boring moments. I just envy the people who were paid to play in or work on this movie. They were actually given money for this crap. Is not it wonderful? I mean in this movie, a man is killed and chopped in a wood mill to small bloody pieces and a few minutes later the mother and the child talk calmly to the table as nothing happened and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such crap movies? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was lame. Not scary and it was obvious that it was a bored stuntman wearing a bad makeup.
