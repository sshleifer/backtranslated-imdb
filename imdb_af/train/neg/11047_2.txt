There are two reasons why I didn't give one to this movie. One of the reasons is some of the actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh), who tried to play on their usually good level of acting. But on many scenes they are somehow blocked by the bad essay. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the cool idea and look at the Cyborg, which is very different from most other such roles I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be. Drilling scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad writing. And it was like the first movie ever for many actors. However, it may have been an interesting story, but they have completely failed.
