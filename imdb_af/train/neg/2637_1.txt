I really don't even know where to start. It is as if someone gave a biblical dollar budget to an autistic third degree and said "make me a secret service movie". The editing is ridiculous, cinematography was at its best arbitrary, every single syllable was completely delayed and directing ... was there even a director there? Everything was just as useless and lame and useless ... and random .... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; This movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> But if you like this piece, you'll enjoy too; Dislike, Dark Blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.
