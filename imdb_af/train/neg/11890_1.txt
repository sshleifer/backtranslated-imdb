From the first time I saw the box cover of the movie and the vast photography I thought this man, this friend of the 'Scwarz' should be like 6 feet or 6ft 2in. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet tall. It's not his fault. <br /> <br /> At any rating, I turned the movie on a cool night in Tucson, on the second story room with a good cigar and let it roll. At that time my wife had a relationship and things were for my hill, so I needed a good diversion. But, as bad as the movie was ... I totally enjoyed it, with a bottle of Merlot, I can admit. <br /> <br /> Surely I watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not that it's been too hard to be cool, or it's so close to hitting the action movie point. It is wild. And then it's really clueless. Then again, desolate. It's best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene. Wow !! I have never felt safe in my life. Warm and happy too. I was grateful that they were kept on the petrol during the race, due to less production in the summer months ... anywho <br /> <br /> The direction was 'oninspired' the order of action and struggle to be choreographed or choreographed and strengthened again, the sound of the delivery did not hit you, it just got going, vice versa. The 'residents' of the town they were in, the town was rather 'Off Cue'. They also didn't seem to have done very well. They will look and even look into the camera lens. Like a deer in the head, something just lifted them with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because 'Columbu' I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own compatriots. <br /> <br /> But "Baretta's Island" is very enjoyable and incredible. Even so, I love it a lot. My now x-woman hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, I'm pretty discriminatory when it comes to movies I want or even love. All in all, I love Franco. So there it is. <br /> <br /> As a movie add-on if you want to kill a few hours with really fun watching, straight to video B movies or 'bad movies for your little library collection, if you can find the Big Sweat (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar. You know the big man of 'TANGO & CASH'. "The Big Sweat", a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting so lame, may also be "on crutches" and at the end of "The Big Sweat" I think they have money walked. because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and burned it during the credits. - Good fun. <br /> <br /> But all, not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave it a '1' and an overall rating of 'terrible' for a terribly good B-movie. I'm waiting for the successor, maybe like 'Baretta's revenge on Montazuma' (Franco takes a Mexican holiday and gets sick on the water then, declares war on the water camp.) Or 'Baretta's powder war' where he would hand out a big drug host in his country and chemically no-splitting and creates a hybrid superbug (insect) that is grown in the cocaine fields and eaten in the cake. It forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke into pure powdered milk. Then another sequel would have saved the young people from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He was able to get a large toothpaste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature. Right? (*)
