The director is trying to be Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters are trying to be Tennessee Williams. Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman. Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye. Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as fast as possible, but can't ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. It provides endless, meaningless dialogue and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a village with beautiful lift lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a beautiful home of Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't see this movie. It doesn't do the spotlight.
