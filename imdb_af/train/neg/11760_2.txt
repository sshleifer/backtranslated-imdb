Amen to Stomach. There was a lot of confusion going on. First, how do you know which movie to buy? Henry Cele stars in each of them. I bought this movie, think it was the miniseries ... WHAT A LETDOWN !! It would have been a comedy, but raped for the young girl. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is good for popcorn TV, but he wasn't credible in this movie (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT IS THE LOVE STORY ??? The movie had to be about a young man's emergence of military force - not the slave ship captain who was looking for the father with the English girl ... <br /> <br /> If I pay more than $ 7 for this movie , I will have to call the police - because it will be a crime!
