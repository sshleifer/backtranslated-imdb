The plot and characters are ridiculous and only qualify as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out of focus and vague. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with dung does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite entertaining, one of the main characters said he had no friends, but in a minute of screen time he held onto the new man and had a lot of women on the side. Although he does show his antisocial trends, he randomly draws an arrow in a poor b ***** d that only keeps his own business! Images of blood or gore flow get more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn't much more stupid than Zombie. Must be a rental if you want crazy Italian movie or are desperate for sword and magic or something bizarre. How do you sleep by someone sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?
