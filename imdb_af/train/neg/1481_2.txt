Did they use their entire budget to pay the stars of porn or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music and editing in general were so bad you would think a 12-year-old wants to make the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was good in light of the writing. The "innocent virgin" played her part very well. <br /> <br /> The mutants look really cool and it could actually have been a very cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately for everyone involved, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Turn Left is made better than this movie and the guys don't have even money! Good thing I didn't rent the movie myself!
