While William Shater can always make me smile, he appears (and I especially like him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal). Well, this show is about glitz and dancing girls and screams and jumps up and down. <Br /> <br /> It has nothing of the intelligence of Millionaire, nothing of the flair of Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time. <br /> <br /> Of course I just watched it out. I watched it for more than 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part was William Shatner dancing on stage. He is a hoot !!! Unfortunately, this display will not. <br /> <br /> It's a given
