0 * s Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the video game director Uwe Boll attempts to restore the game into an action-packed nail bitter. Unfortunately he does not succeed in doing so. Instead, he makes one of the worst movies ever made! Even though he becomes less well-known celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film has the necessary basics that a movie should be good, such as a storyline and some basic relativity of what is in the dark and light continue. The movie is jumping around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make the monsters. Although they look cool and the feed was good, it is a bit lame. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating 0/10.
