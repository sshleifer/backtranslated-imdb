<br /> <br /> Worst. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (except to change it into a 90-minute information for the movie's soundtrack)? Zombies that * run * ??? I suspect the director never watched the original "Dead" films, showing that stiff images (from rigor mortis) shuffle creatures to their living prey. <br /> <br /> And how did the survivors know exactly which boat in the harbor belongs to Steve's recent departure? <br /> <br /> 1/10
