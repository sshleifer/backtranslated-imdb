I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a child. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can't solve a case and all the work is done by the walking dog Dog Brain and his cousin Penny. I heard the live action movie was decent, so I checked it at the library. I hired this movie for free and felt I had to be paid to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick is nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams as the voice of the gadget. His voice was wrong. The girl who played Penny looks nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is a brunette with the cartoon version being blonde with picky little tears. But she did do a decent job she had to work on. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy never hidden in a strange place or exploded messages that he accidentally drove to Gadget. <br /> <br /> The gadget mobile was wrong. It never spoke in the series and it did well. Why did they do that? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too intelligent in this movie. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a half-way decent intellect. It would have worked better if he were a moron. <br /> <br /> Also the slogan completely slaughtered. Borderick says "Wowser". It is and must always be "Wowsers". It sounds lame with the 's'. I got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The only decent gags were during the credits. The lack of Claw is ahead of a support group for restoring henchmen. In the audience, Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond film awareness, a Herve Villacheze look, Oddjob, Kato and more. It's about the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> The other is at the end where Penny looks at this gadget and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams votes the dog and says "Brain is not in the moment. Please tell your name to the sound of the woof. Of course it is not funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie He must have at least the dumb car. <br /> <br /> Children like this, anyone over the age of 13, will. <br /> <br />
