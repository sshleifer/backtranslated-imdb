I hired I AM CURIOUS YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was initially seized by American customs if it had ever tried in this country, a fan of films considered "controversial", I had to see for myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered on a young Swedish drama student named Lena who learns everything she can learn about life. In particular, she would like to draw attention to making a kind of documentary about what the average Swedish thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam war and racial issues in the United States. In between, politicians and ordinary citizens of Stockholm ask about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me is I am CURIOUS YELLOW is that 40 years ago Since then it has been considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheap porn made. While my compatriots find it shocking, sex and nudity are in fact an important pile in the Swedish movie. Even Ingmar Bergman, probably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I recommend to the filmmakers that any sex shown in the movie is shown for artistic purposes. than just shocking people and making money in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of the Swedish theater. But really, this movie doesn't have much of a plot.
