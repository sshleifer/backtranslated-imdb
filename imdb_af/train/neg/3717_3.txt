Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a sociable star vehicle switching his appeal to white and mainstream black audiences, updated the 1978 "Heaven Can Wait" comedy with an urban agenda. He plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident that quickly removed his soul from his body. Therefore, his angels have to find another body to set him up, and can only come from a white businessman. Reviewing a movie such as blatant and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" just shows that Rock's Eye was at the box office (it was strictly a corporate move organized by most mercenaries of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something elevated or more memorable than a stupid reincarnation comedy that culminates in an evening at the Apollo? Wonderful supporting role players (including the usually reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock looks uncomfortable and uncertain about himself. * 1/2 of ****
