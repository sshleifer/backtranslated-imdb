<br /> <br /> As usual, I was really looking forward to a new TV / movie about a favorite subject of mine - making a good change from a * oddly known * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History channel. </ br /> <br /> I was eagerly looking for Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but were dissatisfied with the earth with the realization of the malicious, stupid power of Hollywood - and its ability to make an absolute fortune spend on tripe. <br /> <br /> I was excited about 'The Rise of Evil', especially since I heard Ian Kershaw was involved, as I enjoyed his books. I can see why he stopped. <br /> <br /> To quote someone responsible for this litter: <br /> <br /> "The Kershaw book was an academic piece," he said. "It was <br /> <br /> pretty dry. We needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they completely nuts? Hitler's life cannot be said without 'incident'. Yes, Kershaw's two volume Hitler biographies were long and detailed, but they were supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The thesis behind 'Rise of Evil' seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a VERY bad man, who hated Jewish And just if you miss it, we'll emphasize the fact in EVERY scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to explain the mood of the time, and why Hitler adopted the views and strategy he did. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent Nazis - a Warning from History '- this film fails to point out that almost all the leaders of the Munich communist emergence were Jewish and that it was his views on the subject. colored. - and its axiomatic connection of the Jews to Bolshevism - an absolutely important aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there wasn't much understanding to do - the filmmakers didn't want to go there, so we just got all the stuff we knew anyway. We certainly don't get the fascinating fact that Kershaw refers to, which Hitler was short of socialist / communist shortly after WW1. It would of course be far too complex for the film to handle, and could even detract from the relentless 'he was very bad' mantra that was constantly breaking down. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a charming figure, as well as public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and of course has some views like vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking that many Guardian readers could agree with. He was also loved by animals, and so the perfect dog-flogging scene was so absurd. <br /> <br /> He was also, from all the accounts I saw, a brave soldier in the first half of the world. Seeing him with his iron cross, we never see how he won it (acts of bravery were not in writing, needless to say). We also get no insight into why he was so burned by his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and so many others experienced such a devastating experience. And again, like the point above, the Jewish / Bolshevik link is essential to anyone's understanding of the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why didn't he care about his colleagues who were dead? Or maybe he did - but still made the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This film certainly had nothing to say about it. <br /> <br /> Like too often, days, the movie is a classic example of 'history relevant to the present' and finds out things or awkward facts to fit into 'present' - what to do often meet the lowest common denominator, where you do not trust your audience a thumb, so you just hold a ram in the throat, knowing that you will always get away with it, because there is so much stupid in the world . <br /> <br /> History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it clears our gift for better and worse. This garbage was a good opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it and the sites and great scenes were impressive, but we didn't tell us anything. We did not know it and did not promote any understanding of this dark period in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
