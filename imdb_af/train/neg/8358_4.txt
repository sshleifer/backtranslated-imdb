It's not one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's better movies, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all her heavy drinking, so she takes him to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims a guaranteed cure! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken after surgery. Then he escapes and is rushed over the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite staff pursuing them, they escape the point at which the girl is crazy and Arbuckle will soon be recovered. However, he woke up and everything after the operation is already a dream. There wasn't a sexy crazy girl and Dr Keaton wasn't as big and incompetent as he was in the dream. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Certainly, making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low, but in the day it was guaranteed to laugh. I would also laugh if there was just something funny to respond to! A lot of energy and that's all. <br /> <br /> FYI - during one of the chase, Fatty wonders in a 200 pound men's wow (wow, what is its chance?). And shortly afterwards he returned to a post on which the number 5 was just painted fresh. Consequently, the five are now on the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular participant. However, the number had to appear backwards on Fatty's shirt, but appeared lingering - a mistake as they had to realize the mirror image would be a deterioration. 5.
