*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From here the whole movie falls on itself. First of all, we meet a rogue program indicating that we will find ghost and vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a man with a delayed accent who speaks endless rubbish, two 'ghosts' that have no real purpose and no character, and a lot of fathers. Someone told me they were vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they were so indefinite that I didn't realize. <br /> <br /> The funny accented man with a ridiculous name has the same problem as the Oracle, just for much longer and much worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, makes it, then it goes on and makes it astonished and stupid. His final line before he runs away is comparable to Storm's "do you know what happens to a road ..." line in X men in levels of total mere bad things. The chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic stone and Monica Bellucci, because the woman does nothing but exactly what we expect the moment we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we get another Kung Fu fight !!! WHY? Neo is allegedly The One. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what he uses for it. Kung bloody fu all the time. And while he can stop 1000 bullets, he still gets a sword and makes another meal of 5 invisible handles (vampires?). I wanted to see forces blowing. I wanted to see him the wildest, craziest, worst of all people because he could do anything. I became the same as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The fabulous motor yacht. It can't be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's not just what we meant, it's going to be. All the cool shots of this scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So everyone possible Wow was taken from us so that everything we get now is a good sequel to, guess what, a Kung Fu battle !!! OK, it's not Neo, but you'd think he explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least they learned something. It's not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It's not real. As long as you understand that nothing is real, nothing can really hurt you . " <br /> <br /> There you go. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the chase is not bad. It's never boring and it doesn't look like 16 minutes. It's just as sublime. And still, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The final highlight of the movie is probably the worst imaginable. They have this entire comprehensive plan involving three teams. They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus' ear long, super pastors, monologue. To make it worse, they never clearly define what this plan requires 3 teams. You know basically, but you don't know who does what when one crew goes down, you just don't care about and you don't know how it will affect what's going on. <br /> <br /> I'll sum it up, but it does. Trinity can return to the Matrix to set the end. That's the only reason why this happens. What causes the question, why did they originally have to send 6 people? Trinity gets itself within five minutes! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is equally lazy. Ooohhh !!! He runs in another 100 Agent Smiths !!! Woooooo !!! It must have thought a lot. Only now are they in a corridor, so the battle has no scale and is over. Man, what a grand finale !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the strange man? Add them together and double it, that's how terrible the architect is. The only reasonable potential of him is to set up the climbing climax. <br /> <br /> And then he blows it! <br /> <br /> Let's look at the options he gives to Neo. Choose one door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and die all humanity !!! Consideration of choice is something that this movie is trying to explore, doesn't really give it the hero. If he has a choice of the salvation of mankind and dies or misses the mission and saves mankind, there is the potential for inner torment and tension. Also, with Trinity in the middle of the fall, has the potential of a real stone hanger that made the third more essential. But no. He didn't save anyone or save the missus. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo who died and then returned at the end of life. The year when it came out, everyone was so bad of how stupid Jar Jar, they didn't realize that the end of The Matrix showed him, Steven Hawking. "The Oracle told me I will fall in love with the One, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How could the whole world miss out on how terrible it was? <br /> <br /> So, what does the Wachowski's do in the sequel? Well, they make the end of the original look better. How? Well, by doing just exactly the same thing (just to swap characters), just as much worse, I think my FA and R keys will be exhausted if I write a long time before I get worse. <br /> <br /> And the stone hanger is not really a stone hanger. It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really didn't want to be bad, but it is. Bad in just as many ways. And to make matters worse, it's not a movie with not enough budget. It's not a movie with too short a schedule. It's not a movie that has run out. It's not a movie that has too much outside influence. This is exactly the movie that Wachowski's with Warner's fortune is behind. And it makes it so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum could say it didn't have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and filming film ever made. <br /> <br /> Unmistakable. <br /> <br />
