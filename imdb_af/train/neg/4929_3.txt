The fairy tales in this review are presented as a public service because the only way to enjoy this melodrama costume is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is finally raped. And not a moment too soon. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was afraid I would hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, "The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton" (I think people don't have "I didn't know about spoilers") was written by a woman, " an English fleet that was either upset or cynical or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the writer seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter, like the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is murder. She killed three men in five attempts. A series of femme fatale, she had a case of dissociative personality disorder that had to land in Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vampire, with so much makeup I thought of her as a recovery era Joan Rivers (or a recovery era Joan Rivers, ha!). Still, Lady B. is irresistible to all three main characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason, and Griffith Jones, all of those who do good work, such as Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers realize briefly what a psychotic bitch is Barbara, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them eventually blew her - by accident, in what is meant irony or just dessert. Given the dramatic death scene with a fuss highlighting the camera from the windows and sky, I assume we were meant to kill a damn about her. But hair is the first thing we don't care about.
