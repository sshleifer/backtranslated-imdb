Disappointing and unmistakable boring-real-crime movie that bad-player actor Jeremy Renner mumbled through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most recognizable degenerate / serial killers of the last century. Dahmer was released straight-to-video live in early 2003. It is an exaggerated, boring, heavily-activated and virtually bloodless string festival of a true crime drama that never really dies in the monstrous and demented psyche of the late murderer. It had the perfect potential to do! What it does, try to do for reasons unknown to me, that it is similar sympathy to the viewer for the man, by portraying him as ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and very socially indifferent homosexual loser who look simple. for love in all the wrong places against the cold, calculated and depraved sicko and madman that he was! Overall, 2003's "Dahmer" is one that can surpass true crime buffs everywhere, because I'm not joking when I say it's one of the worst serial killers ever done! It's even harder than other pathetic and exploit straight-to-video waste such as "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
