I like silent movies, but it was a bit too moronic. As much as I wanted, I could say it was the hour I got up, I can't. I don't think any version of the movie comes close to the book. And don't try it on children, they might be freaking. And the lady Pollyanna played, how old was she? 38? I know the labor laws were different ... BUT COME ON PEOPLE.
