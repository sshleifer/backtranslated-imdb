It was a good story, but not very well told. I like the themes and the main story line, which was not as clear as it could have been. Perhaps there was too much going on and a lack of ability to govern it all. The acting was okay to be cheesy, some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors observed their lesser quality moments. It took me a few months to get through the whole movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad. I just finished looking at it and I'm glad I did if the movie was finally moving and had some continuity to the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was subpar. Would recommend for the story line and maybe a little eye candy, and I mean, a little.
