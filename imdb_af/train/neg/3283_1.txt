OK, we all love the daisy dukes, but what about this role? Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there's not one thing about this girl, and Daisy wasn't dieting! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to look at the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed that Boss Hog was so long. It was part of the humor of Boss Hog's size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK, now it gets them throwing Jessica Simpson looked at someone at her husband? He adjusts Luke Duke to a tea !!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes !! It made the movie a breeze from the beginning. I give it a BIG thumb.
