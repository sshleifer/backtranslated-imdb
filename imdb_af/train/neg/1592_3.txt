To increase the drama of this sudsy maternity ward, it is set in a special hall for "difficult cases". The main story is Loretta Young's; She is on leave of a long prison sentence for murder. Will the doctors save her baby for the cost of her life, or consider her husband's plea for the opposite? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they are not the honest kind to say the least. For example, just to make things move, this hospital has a psychological department next to the maternity ward, leaving a woman with hysterical pregnancy wandering over the stealing of babies. <br /> <br /> There is just enough laughter and sarcasm because it is recognizable as a Warners movie, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who swallows gin from her hot water bottle while she waits to have twins who she thinks there are now a law is sold. An example of her repartee: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Of course, Aline MacMahon is wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse, but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the movie is that the face of a baby will cause anyone to stumble. Even with the obvious limitations, this movie had to be better than it was.
