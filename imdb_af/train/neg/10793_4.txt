I watched this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival of 2005. Based on a novel by science-fiction writer Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, clustered twins from their family, by impresario to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately clumsy, the movie is too clever with half (if you forgive the pun). By mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in La Mancha) lost their way fairly quickly. I was never sure I had to do it all seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream series, it was all just a little bit. Plus, the promised rock and roll just didn't move me. At times of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I was reminded a bit too much, a movie I originally found. But in this case the songs were not just as good, and the main characters were not sympathetic either. A more unfavorable comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
