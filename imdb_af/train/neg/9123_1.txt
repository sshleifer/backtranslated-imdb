I don't have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in film history. The fact that it is Sellers' final film makes it increasingly painful. <br /> <br /> The horrible screenplay, direction and shocking wood performances all come together to make this one of the most indifferent horrible films ever made. <Br /> <br /> I wish so much that I could even bury a snicker or a chuckle somewhere in this stack of turbulent blubber, but it is a lifeless, humorous disaster. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why couldn't you stop being there?
