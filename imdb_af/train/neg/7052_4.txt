God this movie was just as boring with the music I really loved. I mean what the point was to make this movie. Everyone who reads this review doesn't look at this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emran can act but was really pathetic. In this movie I am actually ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was just very bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another pretty sight. With no lack of talent she ever does, she can't act at all, and there was no sense that she was in this movie. As for the other girl Radha, she went well, but it could've done better. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time. Please buy the good music and do not look at this movie.
