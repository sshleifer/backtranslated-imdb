In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I have to say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is, of course, a shill reviewer. The plot is thin to say the least. Cantonese dialogue is not funny. See this movie at your peril. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang must be in the movie for the little or no income this movie will generate. The banal plot tries to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just mix in the scenery. It was as if you were drying paint. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on YouTube.
