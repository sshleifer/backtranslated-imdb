To hear such a praise about this play, I decided to watch it when I stumbled on the cable. I don't see how it leaves "women" and their "struggle" by focusing on the subject at hand. I think if you are interested in stories about women's private parts and how it affects their lives then it's for you. Otherwise, it's pretty boring and boring. As something, I found it a little humiliating. <br /> <br /> I asked for a female friend who also watched it and she thought it was terrible too. So, it's not just a guy who doesn't get it.
