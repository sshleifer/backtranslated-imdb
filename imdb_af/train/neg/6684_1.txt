It must be titled, "The curious case of unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non-horror snorer as a shock movie." It's a long, boring story of a brotherhood, a gay so transparent that even Flounder of Delta House can see through it. Jeff East, an actor in the amount payable, can be forgiven for any work he can get. The same cannot be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously performed for such films as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape, but fortunately it's not on DVD. Misrepresented garbage like this belongs to a landfill and nowhere else.
