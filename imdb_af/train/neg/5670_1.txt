The only reason "The Norliss Tapes" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Unlike seeing Angie Baby in a pre-Police Woman performance, there's nothing else to see here. <br /> <br /> THE SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is typed to write a book about the supernatural. One day he disappeared mysteriously after addressing his publisher and said he had stumbled upon something that had put him in a mortal danger. The entire series for which this unfortunate pilot was written, was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks by the "Norliss tapes" - a set of audio tapes recorded by the author during the investigation of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the pilot section, a rich sculptor dies - but not before he bought an ancient Egyptian scarab from a local occult who assured him that the bauble would give him immortality after death. We soon discover that the ring itself does not allow immortality. Instead, it just makes the sculptor's body, which allows him to escape his tomb, so he can run around the village. Beautiful girls wearing all their blood. <br /> <br /> Blue-eyed, yellow-eyed and coarse ARRRHHHHHHHs you have One has not heard since you last watched a "Scooby Doo" cartoon, but the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and contacts Norliss to get his help to leave the secret behind her husband's unpleasant again on her estate. <br /> <br /> Is this man a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? Do not know. We just see him attack, never gather. Why? To fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. It appears that the ruffled sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size image of a demon called Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. Once finished, Sargoth plans to occupy the statue and use it as his gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> "The Norliss Tapes" have not been added. As a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is an awkward, unashamed mess. The acting and the dialogue do not offer better. It's not even a contender for a "So Bad It's Good" award. Sometimes bad is just bad. <br /> <br /> After years of underground rumblings on the great merit of The Norliss Tapes, I was excited to find it on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I didn't set myself for the fall. <br /> <br /> For the first time two days ago, after searching for this groaner, I can only accept applause you've heard from other IMDB reviewers so far. Come from those who review the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they are just loyal supporters of Dan Curtis. Either way, they offered you deceptive reviews of "The Norliss Tapes". <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
