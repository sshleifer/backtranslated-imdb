Excellent drink. I got the 16 minute / 27 second run and gave up. I would have given it a negative number review if it was possible (although "vulnerable" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the sizzle you could see and feel practical between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between dumb guys Dicky Crenna and what her face here just doesn't exist. The anklet becomes an unappealing piece of bracelet? There is no ciggy lighting for finger tip? And I thought I would be SICK if they practically buried (and at the same time believe you, my) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes by explaining his "Little Man" to Mr. Garloupis. No offense at all, but it seems a post-blind men ran amuck with the design of both the Dietrichson and Neff homes. The same goes for the terribly braided pants that Phyllis wears. And crikey, how many $$ does Neff make, he looks out over a big port? It, people, again, everything takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get more of it, you have a stronger constitution than I am, or you are a masochist. But please, take Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop a "little man" of your own that can never go away. Continue with caution, of course.
