Normally, I'm not the kind to be afraid of horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie came in my mind !!! It is a very simple movie, but at the same time very effective, it has a good atmosphere and it creates a few shocking moments. The girls coming down the hill are a real outcome. Another was the family photo, I didn't expect it and I jumped out of my seat !!! I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, with the lights off, it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
