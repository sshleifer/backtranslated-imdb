Humm, an Italian movie played by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I didn't expect much, to be honest and I even took less than I expected. This does not mean this movie is the worst I have seen, because I have seen worse things than this, but the plot was confusing and uninteresting most of the time and some good gore scenes are the only thing that saves it. In addition, you will love special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I just want to see "Troll 3" by the same director, sure it won't be worse than that.
