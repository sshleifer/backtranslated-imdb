The movie is bad. Nothing special - just a "child" movie with no serious thing in it. However, there is one reason to look for: the animals are talking. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you just can't stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound that says, "I'm Keyser Soze," or another animal that says, "You're a dead cat walking," or many other funny one linen, see it. Because there is no other good movie to see. Vote: 4 out of 10.
