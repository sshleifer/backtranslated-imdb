A decent sequel, but don't grab the punch of the original. A murderous scriptwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still killing relentlessly, but movie looks very tongue-in-the-cheek. Any humor is not funny. The overall project looks like the quality of fast and fast Nelson is. This movie is about a script to be rewritten before going to the screen ... it had to happen with this script.
