Entertainment Tonight has gone hill this past few years, but tonight (August 17, 2006) they reached a new low. <br /> <br /> In an effort to increase their broadcast, they decided to put real-life photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers, said last night: "Photos of the case you've never seen not ". The two pictures were graphic and very disturbing. One was from the side of her face and head / neck and you could clearly see the cord that used her to strangle her around her neck and bruise her face. It was so horrible, I couldn't believe it. How about ANY distance related to Hollywood Entertainment? Nothing !! They have dropped their levels of dignity and values ​​to new levels ... and show them. It used to be the premiere show to watch ... and it's just rubbish now. <br /> <br /> From now on I will have access to Access Hollywood.
