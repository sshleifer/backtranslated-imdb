The Dereks apparently struggled to find Rollies for Bo to "10". <br /> <br /> I've been working for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day the writing for "Ghosts Can Not It" can circulate among the coaches in the "fish house" where food is prepared for the dolphins. There was one scene where a dolphin so-called "Bo" (or "Top dolphin") asked to make eggs. We do not read the script, but we did not do a part of this movie at our facility, although we did dolphins in the "Big Blue!" <Br /> <br /> It should have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he had fun in this movie because it certainly did nothing for his legacy.
