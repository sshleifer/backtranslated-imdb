It's a great step to the surprisingly enjoyable original. This successor is not nearly as fun as one, and it spends too much time on plot development. Tim Thomerson is still the best of the series, but his wisecracking has been featured in this entry. The performances are all adequate, but this time the writing leaves us. The action is just routine and the plot is only lightly interesting, so I need a lot of stupid laughter to stay on during a Trancers entertainment. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and so this film is at its best visible.
