Oh a vague one-time actress in a movie where she plays a mother for a child. It is shown on BBC 1 at midnight, I wonder if ... it is a TVM <br /> <br /> You have to hand it over to TVM producers, not happy with making a mediocre movie. , they usually give two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed and NEWS TO KEEP, is no different. The first theme is a woman in danger, and a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme means that we have a play of the heroine who survived a murder attempt, followed by a scene with her son. Sam asks why she's divorced? And she's a TVM she replies that the reason is that people change, rather than say something like "I'm a real sleeper" or your father's public toilets for sex, "and this happens in divorce cases. young Sam, I feel sorry for not only his parents being divorced, but he is as thick as two short boards, actually since he is so stupid, he deserves no sympathy because he is not aware that a man is stuff Toilet is a drug dealer, unaware that you can die if someone shoots at you and unaware that I love LUCY, is painfully unsuitable. If only our own childhood was so innocent, Ah and Orwell said, "Ignorance is strength." Oh, hold fast Sam is suddenly an expert on the marine life! Is this character development or dissertation? I know what my money is. And strangely, Sam did not notice the boy if the story was set in 1994, why people often wear clothes, drive cars and drive trains from the 1950s, but as it turns out during a plot it is the mom what the dummy is. Then there's a last plot that makes me feel like an idiot to watch it
