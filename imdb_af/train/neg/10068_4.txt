A cowboy, sympathetic to the condition of a nearby Indian tribe, is mistaken for the rape and murder of the chief's daughter, leading to much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This crackpot nudie feature is fun to watch, though Thoroughly impossible to defend at any artistic level. The awesome costumes and the fact that all the Indians are white, of course, make it more like a lively action cartoon than the serious production that makes it pressurized as if it were. <br /> <br /> In short, the abundance of nudity (the right reason to watch it) is good. Everything else is not. There are definitely better examples of both genres. <br /> <br /> More interestingly, the Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and didn't have one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who were probably already in the tin for killing the moment it hit the soda-colored screens of the Pussycat theater!
