This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before, it depicts more of the Alamo's myth than history. The production is poor, overall the impression of a welfare project for many actors who otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. That was the biggest mistake for me. I know the centuries and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors who have been chosen to show them, never leave a hint of credibility. <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up with mythology. I learned more about history later. From any perspective, I can accept a decent production (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but it never gave me the chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this blunt mess, while only slightly less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it.
