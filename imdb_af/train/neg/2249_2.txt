It's a terrible disaster of a movie. From start to finish, it is filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the movie are a few numbers by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem with this film is that we never see the character of Kristofferson at his peak or Streisand's character. The first must be seen in decline and the second rise. The final Streisand number was one of the biggest finals in the film, if properly edited. The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, audience and wide shots of the stage were shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This movie should be directed and edited by a NYU film school dropout. The only thing that could be worse is the miserable performance. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even it is completely hit by deceptive technical decisions.
