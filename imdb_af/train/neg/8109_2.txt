*** Contains Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I made it incredibly boring and rather superficial, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: since we eventually have to die, how do we approach life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to experience that question, like Sabina? How much is faithfulness in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be crippled for our loved ones? How much should we be involved in the political life and social problems of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I didn't read the Kundera novel, but after I was released by the movie, I will definitely: I want to understand whether the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (this is my guess ) or if it was from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I disagree with most positive comments made by the film as a masterpiece. I just don't see the reasons why. What I see is many mistakes, and an example of this is following. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what they are driving when they make their choices. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are just there to fill the gaps, but they don't add anything to the story and you're wondering if they're really needed. <br /> <br /> 3) I don't like how Thomas is personalized. Nothing good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his confidence fails and he realizes that he is dependent on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina can afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main characters are very successful in their respective occupations, which seem strange to me . a) How can Tereza become such a good photographer effortlessly? b) How can they do so well in a country that does not have all the economic incentives that people usually motivate to succeed, <br /> <br /> 5) The false accent of English spoken by the actors , is laughing. And I'm not even mother tongue. In addition, the letter Sabina received while writing in the US wrote in Czech, which I found very contradictory. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments have praised the film that Prague was beautifully presented: I think most of the film was shot on the spot, so it's not hard to make the film an Eastern European feel. do not give, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague it is not even difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the end kind of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of the "metro police", far from the social struggle their fellow citizens live, apart from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after realizing they are happy. Approximately? If they unfortunately died, would the message of the movie be different? I do not think so. I considered it a cheap trick to please the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the movie that is unbearable is the way the director portrays the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are nothing more. You don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you stay there in your couch and look at a series of events and scenes that have very little to say. 9) I hate the "stop the music in the restaurant's scene (which has praised some commentaries). Why did Sabina have such a strong response? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don't see the point. The only one The thing that you learn is that Sabina has a very bad temper and a strong personality - that's what is so special about it and <br /> <br /> After all those negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked very much (therefore I gave it a two). <br /> <br /> The "Naked Women Photoshoot", where the envy, the jealousy and the uncertainties of Sabina and Tereza beautiful <br /> <br /> The other scene is the one that represents the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza photos, taken to let the world know what is going on in Prague, are used to the people. who identify with the riots, I found it very original and became Tereza's sense of despair and guilt oi depicted. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small possibility that the film is deliberately designed so that Tomas types are going to keep it and "Tereza kids" are going to hate it. If that is the case (I strongly doubt it), my comments need to be drastically reviewed.
