Note: I will reveal an important part of the plot, but if you have looked at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you will already know it. <br /> <br /> This movie is written by an eleven year old who is not very bright and probably very tired when he wrote it. The author does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the UN and the NSA look like Hungary. Forget the fact that when these master intelligence go to someone whose bare touch will kill you in a minute, they don't wear protective equipment (even gloves). This is a doubt in the context of this movie. In the scientific world in this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity sideways. <br /> <br /> The fact is that people in this movie (with a few exceptions) don't behave the way people behave. Almost every time a character responds to something, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes soap opera scripts look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
