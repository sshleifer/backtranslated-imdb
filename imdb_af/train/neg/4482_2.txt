A perfect horror ... I doubt a single shot lasted for more than the MTV 4.4 seconds. Lush decisive, worse even than in Kusminsky's version (a reminder: he missed Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But hey, the rich have what they deserve. Dark and breeding Heathcliff diminishes to the condition of a golden-locked angel, angry and angels Catherine, presented as a chubby, melancholy, gentle and weak Linton's gaze, and innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle-Gellar's character cruel intentions. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch dunners take note. This thing was made for you. It's an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you; You are saved from the awkward necessity of not even understanding the complexity of the characters, but even of the initial shock to their actions. The actors tried, but as I have already said, they were missed. Good photography, but editing is at the level of the TV production class in high school. I command you all: read the book, or the cliffs, even; look at its previous versions, even Kusminsky's; but stay away from the many future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefits of the commercial free premiere.
