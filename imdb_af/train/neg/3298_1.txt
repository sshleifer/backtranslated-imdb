When I heard that the Dukes or Hazzard would again be made with current actors and a solid screenplay, I was like, "Okay, I'll give it a chance, it's not going to be better than the first, but we'll see What happens. "Well, I saw what happened. I saw a big late 70's / 80's show which is a classic, mainly humiliated by Hollywood. It is so sad to see that Hollywood screenwriters today can't do anything original. They look like a good performance that has a good target audience, and is trying to "revive" the classic performance. HEAD UP Hollywood ... THIS IS NOT WORKING! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have thrown a better actor than Sean William Scott (American Pie Stiffler) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider was definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and used. Also, get the rights, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How low can you go? A Crappy Jackass actor to play lovely Luke. It makes me sick. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman but suck her acting. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy was smart, sexy, strong, opinion and a good IL's southern girl. She was every little role-playing model that grew up! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit slut like Daisy Duke. Daisy was never blonde. Why did they have to throw her. Jessica Alba would have played a big Daisy Duke. She can speak with a big southern accent, and she is beautiful and would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie has blown something fierce. I feel like I've been torn by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they have to repay my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (the original series), see this movie. It will just upset you. CMT (country music television) plays the rest of the Dukes all the time later in the night. So set your TIVOs and go with the right thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
