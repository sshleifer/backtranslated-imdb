The brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes seems to have sent the writing of this one offshore, perhaps to the Mediterranean? "PP" reminds me of one of the many boring, promising but predictable within one season, David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so exuberant, they hardly give out sympathy or grief. And that's what actually makes good medical drama bushes - dramatic situations you're scared of, "That can be me." They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the lines are dead and cannot be brought back to life. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Everyone who writes her articles has taken the ethics and transfer / counter-transfer courses in Stanford. Someone should give them an ethical code to read (the episode with the nosebleed woman and the therapist's involvement in it). No therapists are so bad. <br /> <br /> Women crave men who have attacked - were killed, we all slaughtered and graduated from the city. Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it well. The only successful / bad development is that Addison struggles with her decision to move to LA, and the "Voodoo Dr" and his dealing with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept may work with a whole new writing team.
