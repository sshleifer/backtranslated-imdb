OK, I've been a big fan of the Black for a long time and have been relaxed after watching this movie. Let's mention the problems ... First of all, this movie has much of the same crew that had the first two. It is also called the PREQUEL for the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they can't correctly name Shetan's dam or its color? In the Black Stallion Returns we learn the Sagr was the Black's CHESTNUT mother and in this movie she's a gray mare name Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it was in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I can be wrong, but the first one was also in the 1940s when the ship was wrecked. Timeline doesn't sound right. Also, as a goof, there is a Friesian in the beginning of the movie supposed to be Shetan's father. On further notice, it seems to be valid. Ben Ishaak is the only character left to even make this movie appear to be related to the previous two in any way. It may be a nice family movie for me, but it's my biggest movie show of the year.
