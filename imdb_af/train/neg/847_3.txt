The movie is about two brothers that should be equal - but they don't seem smart - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses like they want to call themselves that sound very exaggerated when compared to personal attributes, can be seen from the material of the title. <br /> <br /> I honestly didn't have the style of the movie. I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues bring it, there is for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much. The movie is cheap on scenes and basically tells the story without any human aspect in it. It gives the comic book experience. However, it is visually beyond the viewer, it somehow brings him into the blues with short dialogues, monotonic scenes, dynamic cuts, music and sudden sounds. <br /> <br /> The movie's storyline is very simple, most of what is going on is dramatically suggested for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium-simulating drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will openly say that this movie did not meet my protrusions a little.
