Bonjour Tristesse covers similar land as "The Member of the Wedding." An possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship between a beloved family member and an interlocutor from forming. While critics "love the wedding," I find Julie Harris a jumbo dress and an adenoid, spectacular in everything she was in. It contains annoying, rich idiots like last year at Marienbad, but this time it is a travel book. <br /> <br /> In this Preminger movie, rows are developed but characters do not. For the first 30 minutes, he is pleased to fade the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. Once the conflict is instituted, Seberg cannot deliver the depth the part needs. Kerr ranks and turns the movie into "Endless Love." Seberg's turbulent narrative is like something from Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really wish someone other than Niven in his role. He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his movies. He never came to the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable sequence, an evening dance is becoming free for everyone in a harbor. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise, "The Conformist." Kerr is on board to clamp her hands and portray another great pain (such as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven knows Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc.). Really, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every movie could end up with a fatal car accident, or even better, with one. <br /> <br /> People who are uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid it.
