Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see there ... I held for the weekend with my nephew and that's what he wanted - Yes ... <br /> <br /> I use to watch this show when I was in college ... it was senseless, fun, and somewhat action-oriented. The show has a good heart tho ... and the characters were cute; No one has ever been killed or even injured. It was like a cartoon coming to life. Cut until 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there is simply no coherent story and the performances are strange ... almost annoying - certainly not true to the original characters. The whole thing is like a Mad TV skit and it takes more than 100 minutes! It was one of the few times I saw a movie. What do they think? As I can say best, the product needs marketing, toys, etc. Be. All I can say is let one die quickly. It makes the original Dukes or Hazzard look like Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remake left over from TV is Gilligan's Island ... Good Luck!
