I love how it started, with some decent special effects, especially for a 50-year-old movie. There were some impressive scenery. The film, however, falls early early with some very stupid dialogue, as the men all try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius." See it in the 90s after a long absence It was nice to see Francis again, an actress who mostly did television shows since this film was released. It was also interesting to see a young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not admit if it were not for this voice. <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie before the boredom almost came over and I had a strong desire to go to bed. I appreciated them doing this VHS tape again in stereo. but it was a poor effort. This is an overestimated movie where "elites" think so "heavy" and "thoughtful". That's nonsense. It just appeared "intelligent" because the rest of the 50's sci-fi movies were so stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some if the early scenes on big screen would look good, which I did not at the time of this writing. Maybe another look - this time on the 2.35: 1 widescreen transfer will make me change.
