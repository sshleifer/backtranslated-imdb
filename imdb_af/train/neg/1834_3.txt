I can't say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (just like the current ratings here). I rented it about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even tried / enjoyed it by watching it twice, but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I'm not one to dirty a movie, but I think it's really awful. It wasn't even funny at all. The only pieces I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this movie destroys me Jack Black and Ben Stiller. All I can think of when I see one of their movies is this horrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very irritating. <br /> <br /> Overall, well, I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken, incidentally.
