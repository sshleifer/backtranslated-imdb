This movie is just another average action movie, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out, they really need choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made the brilliant performance in Heat as they enter the street of the robbery - would have changed the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the movie was good - predictable but viewable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show, the one we were waiting for, but was like watching the A-team in the 80's. They shoot wild, nothing hits, and they run around a house to kill each other - the same guy, the same guy.
