Absolutely drunk slasher film does not have a reasoning quality. It has camp counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson .. furious as the murderer, her chicks when she wastes, is not even amusing) on ​​the war path that kills teens who do the least bit of naughty or resist her good behavior pleadings. We run the spectrum of boring, cleaved murders such as a child hitting the throat, looking for his Freddy-glued glove, a child who gets a chain saw, one being drilled, one being chopped up ( full of leeches), one that is fried, etc. <br /> <br /> It doesn't have one original idea to offer and is just a waste of time. This is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's (who plays the slut Ally) tits. Most of the violence takes place on the screen, so even that won't satisfy.
