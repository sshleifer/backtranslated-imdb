High people <br /> <br /> Forget about that movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as an executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX is a joke. <br /> <br /> The first vampires were good ... and they were the only vampires. This thing just bears the same name. <br /> <br /> Just think of a waste of time ... <br /> <br /> JAKE Scorpio
