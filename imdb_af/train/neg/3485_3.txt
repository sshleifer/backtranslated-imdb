This movie was pretty absurd. There were some funny parts. It goes right into the bin of movies in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... that movie has some funny parts, but generally, pretty ridiculous plot (or lack)." <br /> <br /> I thought Ben was trying a bit too hard to be a funny guy. And I didn't understand how he was a self-made multi-millionaire and still such an idiot. Anyway, I love Ben Affleck. He made a little shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I looked like Jersey Girl, I didn't think Gigli was all his fault, I like him overall. I think he is like the child you feel sorry for, because he can't do it. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this movie. It didn't really develop into a workable plot, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not used so well. They earned better. Overall, this movie is NOT House alone, it's not a Christmas story, it's NOT Christmas holidays or any of the other classics. Forever Forgettable.
