I love the often malformed "Masters of Horror" series. Horror fans live in a constant lack of nutrition. Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" gave us 'Fees' - as it or slap it) are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horrible prayer to develop and feed for us what Love to eat at abomination. <br /> <br /> This one started with a core of really cabbage idea and running ... right from the edge of "where in the world am I going with this?". <br /> <br /> I don't know how to spoil the spoil, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... no, there was that light that had drifted over the night sky ... we had long cock luminescent strangers (huh? ... huh?) brain bubble males and ... yes, I get it ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - an exciting and promising setup without a satisfactory denial. br /> <br /> Go to storytellers ... your build up should have a payout that exceeds the build up. Not the other way around. Math Story Story 101. <br /> End Spoilers - Big Oops!
