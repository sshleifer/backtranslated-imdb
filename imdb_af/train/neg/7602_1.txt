One of the other commentators mentioned that they were almost out. If I wasn't with my wife, who wanted to stay, I'd be gone. It's also a shame because I think it could have been a good movie. But it's easily one of the worst custom screens I've ever seen. It starts nowhere and it goes nowhere (I want to say it doesn't go anywhere fast, but it's really going nowhere slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time there are hints that something interesting can happen, or that there may be some depth under one of the characters, but that's all we get - tips. There is no single payout or revelation in the whole movie. Not that I need a smooth plot to be entertained. I love a good winding character study as much as the next indie buff. But these characters don't add anything. For the whole duration of the film, you don't care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost hope they die, because at least death can be more interesting than looking at their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you would think it would be compelling, but it is not . Instead of eye-catching, noir-esquire characters who work hard-boiled, you immediately recognize it for what it is: a bunch of talented but mysterious actors who breed and raise their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context . All this for two plodding, painfully slow hours. Awful.
