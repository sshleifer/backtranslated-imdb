Trite, clich√© dialogue and plot (the same kind of things we've all seen during the 1980's fantasy flies), Hokey Music, and a character painting number number beat it out for everyone except hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> Saving the movie of the rubbish dump is the wonderful stool of Bakshi's work, the rotoscope, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. The violence is spectacular and the art and animation are different from any other sword and magic movie of the period. <br /> <br /> I like to play it with the sound, and play the soundtrack to the first Conan movie.
