This movie made me feel like I had missed some important scenes from the start. There were continuity errors and plots that suddenly stopped as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover. In addition, Danny Glovers has always been confident and respected in his choice of roles, for example "Grand Canyon". I couldn't finish this movie, which looked like an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters that made you flourish or sympathize. There was no emotion about this movie, and the cuts of their past were poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What would be a good idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love watching white people freak out and start acting like complete idiots, let me laugh) have a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store.
