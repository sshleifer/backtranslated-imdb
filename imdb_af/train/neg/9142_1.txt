I just watched it after hearing how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Although, even if you read all the negative comments here, you will never be close to understanding how horrible this movie is, even though it is one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen! Never bothered to comment on this, but this piece of crap really justifies it. <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot is ridiculous and stupid. Brother of the main character (or Ben of Arthur, I forget what is and frankly it is never very clear) wants to stop a kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is horrible to Christians but apparently mass murder not it. Then there are a few other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force him to recall her at the gun. This leads to nothing, but offers us one of the funniest rules of dialogue in the whole "movie" - "I don't make sense, you don't make sense! That's what makes sense!". Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there's the play that's just horrible. It must be seen to be believed. My personal favorite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer, who clearly reads her lines but still manages to solve them. Enough said. The gay couple couldn't be less convincing. There is the vaguely handsome and completely grimless man, and his boyfriend looks like that little cartoon doughman of the bisto advertisements. Just lace. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "movie" is also filmed by someone who is unable to even hold a camera, and the number of errors throughout is wonderful. The whole thing kicks off with the thick headman in bed with a pair of boots on. Yep. <br /> <br /> But anyway, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I would like to highlight the most precious comedy moments that the "movie" offers. <br /> <br /> - When the fat man ignites the church and then comes across the parking lot like a six-year-old girl to make his escape. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! No idea what she's the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she comes in a few scenes. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The stoned lawyer. <br /> <br /> - The evil brothers' dinner of crackers he offers to his guests. <br /> <br /> - The evil brother's anti-gay potion. <br /> <br /> - The cats of the evil brother. <br /> <br /> - The end, which I will not throw away, because it must be seen as believed. I warn you though, make sure you don't eat right now !! The bath of the main character / director / producer becomes bare. It's dirty. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but inadvertently the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good about this apology for a movie, but managing a director even succeeds in joking the opening credits by writing his own name 15 times.
