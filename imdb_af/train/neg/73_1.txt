It must be the worst piece of garbage I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heartbeat? He looked. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts were a real-life item because I wondered and wondered what she saw in him for 2 of the longest hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a sad? With the scruffy beard and deer-in-the-headlights looking over him, I can't say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual fantastic self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Should I be sorry for bank robbers and murderers? It's far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually an entertaining movie. It was trite, clich√©-ridden and boring. We just stayed because we were convinced it would be better. It didn't. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are shrouded in a border hotel, and women and children die because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny when they ran out of the hotel with the weapons, because all we could think of was the Black Knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I waited for them to say, "I'll bite your leg off!" We cried with laughter, just like many other popular members of the audience. When we were gone, everyone talked about what a waste of time this movie was. <br /> <br /> I didn't pay cash to watch this disaster (sneak preview), but it was definitely not free. It took me 2 hours of my life to never return.
