This early John Wayne Lone Star western went a little more than the milestone oats that Wayne made for Lone Star at that time. For one, it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, which is a much better actor, is the standard Lone Star villain, an essential professionalism in the environment, rather than the usual hesitant line readings often offered in these oaters. The plot, about the wrong identity, pay robbery and murder, is as thin and perfect as you'd expect it to be in a Western budget of the 1930s, but Wayne's strapping view, comfortable charm and a line-up a long way to make it more enjoyable. Bald, naked Eddy Chandler is not entirely credible as Wayne's female "partner", and there's a running mouth about something that happens when Chandler and Wayne are about to get a fist fly that gets annoying. On the other hand, Wayne's love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" of the early "Little Rascals" boasting. She is now 20 years old, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's top ladies in this Lone Star / Monogram "B's" were pretty vague and colorless, but Mary is beautiful, cute and, yes, sexy. There is a scene in the shop where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of "nerve tonic", which appears on the upper shelf, so she must get a leather and climb to the top. shelf. Wayne's islands touch the back of her as she picks up the steps, and when she returns, a few minutes later when he asks her to climb and get another bottle for him, it is surprisingly furious for a film made in 1935. Wayne doesn't try to hide the fact that he's definitely checking her butt. Anyway, it's an interesting little "B", not big, but not as slick and random as many of its time LoneStar productions. The final gunfight is not handled so well, and after a while Chandler gets a bit annoying, but it's a glance, just to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
