Vipul Shah has done really impressive work in the past as a movie maker. 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His latest outing as a filmmaker, London Dreams, arrives as his worst journey. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' has a mediocre storyline, it's about how successful the friendship is in hate. Agreed, it has the potential, but if you look at "London Dreams," you wonder what happens? This movie may have the worst climax in recent times. Vipul Shah the writer sits down Vipul Shah's director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is terrible. How can anyone forgive someone who has decided to destroy you? I will not. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask for his lazy buddy forgiveness, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reached India, rather than hitting or abusing him, Salman welcomed him with baja and said he was the reason behind the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as a GOD? If so, if you have completely failed. The only question I want to ask for Vipul Shah is to welcome a person who has ruined you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, do not deceive us (the audience), we are wise enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> It's a musical, but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song stays in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is excellent. He's wearing the film on his shoulders and doing really well in the emotional scenes. But again his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like a delay. Ajay is equally good, but Salman completely overshadowed him. Asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this movie? Rannvijay ham, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is good like the vamp. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream remains a dream!
