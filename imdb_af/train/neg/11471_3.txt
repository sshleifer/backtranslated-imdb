Is it coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "jaws rip off", but it is clear that it has tried to take advantage of Jaw's success. In the first place, Orca was, I think, a bad movie, not terrible, but certainly not good, average at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male killer fishery (killer whale) after seeing its mate and his unborn calf. Killed by a fisherman seek revenge. I couldn't stand watching this movie again. The direction of this film is poor and compared to Jaws, it looks like the director, producers and writers were almost talented. <br /> <br /> Regarding the acting, it was very average and credible, but the real characters are not the least likely. The effects were in order for the time and the footage of the killer fishery looks pretty good. <br /> <br /> The violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very loud, drowns the sound effects and irritates at times. I hated how they dominated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales do not fit with just one partner as depicted in Orca.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad / poor in my opinion of the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I'm not going to use this movie, and I can understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for his concept possible a 5/10)
