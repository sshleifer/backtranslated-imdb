Boy, it was a lousy movie! While I haven't seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can confidently say it's the worst. This rich but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Mediteranean, which ruled over an appointed staff when she is suddenly visited by this travel poet. In fact, the whole movie is just a talk party, with lots of talk that doesn't make sense. Even in 1968, no one can make heads or tails of these pretentious nonsense, and over time it becomes even clearer. If it wasn't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery, it would be a negative rating. The only thing this movie is good about is its unintentional laugh at the expense of the stars.
