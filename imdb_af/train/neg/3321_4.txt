Usually I know after the first minute of a movie if I will hate or worship it ... but now I went wrong. <br /> <br /> The start was wonderful; the "it is based on a real story" and blah blah blah thing was funny. After that, the cartoons and the description of the guys' life with pictures made me think I made the right choice. <br /> <br /> When I saw Toronto's hilarious look, it was cool. The situation and appearance of the house was also my first idea to confirm. <br /> <br /> It may have been the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then looks like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's just me who doesn't understand English-Canadian humor (it's possible, English Canadians don't always understand Quebecois humor), but hey ... there were plenty of things for a short movie, nothing more. Maybe it's a meaning to the title? Anyway, almost everything was filling, and very few things were even funny to me. <br /> <br /> In fact, "making" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything bad. The potential of the idea was wonderful; Therefore, I hired the movie, interested in the "nasty people disappearing" thing. But I didn't know the whole universe would disappear, and even a point on the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are English Canadian, it looks like you can appreciate the local humor, considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8th. Otherwise, just think twice before losing your precious time.
