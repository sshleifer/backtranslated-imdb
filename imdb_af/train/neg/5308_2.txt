Nothing can prepare you for another common bimbo outing! This time it is brought to you by the inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As far as mining movies go, don't click this one! As a science fiction, it is clearly original! All we see is an ugly female android that carries a bikini to destroy the earth and withstand anything almost barefoot to resist! Give me a f --- ing pause !!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, why not push the old SI swimsuit out of the attic for a change? It would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor at a very high level, but it wouldn't make one big. I would like another movie called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which corresponds to ALIENATOR's identity. This illustrates why top-notch 1-person "femme fatale" action movies don't translate well into America. Sorry, fellas!
