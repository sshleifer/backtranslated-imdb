I watched this movie and hoped for something to improve all the time. What's so nice about a man with no emotion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex showing emotion to anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that's why his son is the only one to let him lose his temper (if you can call it), I get it. <br /> <br /> Characters are undeveloped, relationships are not given enough time to understand In one scene Sarah says they will not fall in love and the next time we see her, she talks about how his death really shakes her did because they were so close? Logical synapses are abundant in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's like someone looking at Boogie Nights and writing this section to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene where he loses his temper is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, until the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion. Were there, did you? Can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This movie not only had emotion, it didn't have dust, good writing, developed characters, and a plot. And this is definitely a lack of recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
