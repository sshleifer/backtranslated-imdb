As a "dilapidated Catholic" who had 11 years of Catholic school but was not in the Mass for 35 years, except for weddings and funerals, I thought I would get a kick out of it. And I did it. . . for the first two thirds of the movie. These were all the standard things - strict parochial schooling, suppressing sexuality, etc. But then the movie suddenly meant. Actually means. Note, I saw it before the pedophilia scandals hit. . . and maybe I was not so offensive to such nasty, hateful digs at the Catholic Church if I knew about those abominations (such a Catholic term!) and coverings. <br /> <br /> It was a few years since I rented the video, and I won't be renting it again with a new perspective. It just left a dirty, nasty, ugly taste in my mouth. . . I wonder what the experience of all the actors with the church was, because they * really * hated it, or they hid themselves for the salary. It is an amazing anti-Catholic film, offensive to anyone who has a glitter of respect for Catholic education. What I still do because there were no better teachers in the 50's. Whatever the nuns did, forced me to learn how to read and write the English language. They made us memorize. (How many kids can do simple arithmetic today in their heads?) Truth is, there is nothing more necessary for success in America. Can you read? Can you add / subtract / multiply / divide? Great. You can have any advanced degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will satisfy you in the right place, not only as you continue your studies but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of Catholic "mythology" that we all had to learn. <Br /> <br /> Such a big role, such a bad, rotten writing. I really feel bad (and no, it's not bad - trust me, the nuns have taught me better) for the writer and director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed emotions about the Catholic school. But the participants in this project should be the bad (ie, stupid) children sitting in the back of the room, if they were willingly involved in making this movie.
