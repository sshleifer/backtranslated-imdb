Horrible. I see many users commenting on how big this show is. It's really a Will-be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are lame ... and the plot is ridiculous. Of course, the actors struggle to be funny and are probably cut when they hit those terrible punchlines (if you can call them). Most of the other users who comment are, of course, from another planet (or at least another continent). Of course there are reasons why TV companies cancel to show ... and nothing of the time is when the programs go well. Make sense? Anyway, push clear - even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else to do on this planet ... rather be in the rain - more fun.
