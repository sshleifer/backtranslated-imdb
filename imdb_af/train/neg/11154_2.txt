This move was on TV last night. I think as a time filler, because it sucked badly! The movie is just an excuse to show a few tits and ass in the beginning and somewhere in half. (Not bad tits and ass). But the story is too ludicrous for words. The "wolf", if that is what you can call it, is barely shown to save its teeth. If it is completely in view, you can clearly see that they had some props that work on the CGI, because the wolf runs as if walking in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it's been washed, glitter :) <br /> <br /> The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily find out who will be killed / cut / eat. Even if you like this kind of flashy movie, you'll be disappointed. They didn't do a good job with it. <br /> <br /> Don't even start me on the actors screaming the girls every 5 seconds about everything. But then, if someone asked me to do bad acting, just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> Overall boring and fake horror.
