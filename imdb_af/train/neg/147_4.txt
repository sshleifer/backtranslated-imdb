"Valentine" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think "Halloween", "Friday 13th", "Scream" and "I Know What You Last Summer"). It's certainly not as good as the movies I've listed, but it's better than most ripoffs that came out after the first "Friday the 13th" movie. One of those movies was the 1981 Canadian "My Bloody Valentine", which I really hated. "Valentine" is a better movie than this one, but it doesn't say much. The plot: A nerdy young boy is harassed at the beginning of the movie and pranked by some of his classmates. Then the movie moves later when those classmates grow up, then they are chosen one by one. The murderer is supposed to be the young boy who is now all raised to take revenge. But is it him? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive role that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a scary manuscript doesn't really make them right. However, there are a few scary moments throughout. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
