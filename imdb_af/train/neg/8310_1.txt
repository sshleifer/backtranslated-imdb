Another great conspiracy film that is trying to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served in the US Army can see how deceptive this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and ways are wrong. (And of course, all Senior Officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Blatant propaganda without attempting to achieve objectivity. Most of the theories offered have been rebuked over the past few years. Use every click, rumors, and urban legend from the Gulf all are presented as gospel. (The truth is, no one knows why some GW veterinarians are sick and others are healthy like horses.) PS It's not new. War is NOT fun and I also know WWII, Korean and Vietnam veterinarians with some very serious ailments. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.) Sensational movies like this won't solve the problem!
