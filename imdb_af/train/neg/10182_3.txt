Well, just by reading the title, you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well but became so boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It tells a story about a mother who is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader, that she will go to any length to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is in the way of the girl. She always wins the competitions and therefore pushes the mother further to "eliminate" her. After talking to a "hitman", the mother decided that the girl should be a little first. So actions are taken, but she is eventually caught. <br /> <br /> The role is awful and the film is too long to happen. Don't waste your time watching it. <br /> <br />
