Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local congregation of Reverand, who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but is also a solid woman and decides to expire his own death with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). But so he gets amnesia (hence the name of the movie). Sally Kirkland is also at hand as a crazy old boyfriend who is in pain for the good Reverand in a shades of "misery" kind of way. It is sad to see a reasonably good role being wasted. Not least, John Savage has a very forgotten role as an unashamed private investigator. In a movie that is considered a "black comedy" one has to bring both elements into the movie. While bringing the former into spades, it does not contain any of the latter. Furthermore, you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as such, they have absolutely no interest. Technically not an all-embracing bad movie just an extremely forgetful one. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich becomes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows a little <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Where I Seeed It: Showtime Showcase
