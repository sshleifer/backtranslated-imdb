I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This movie is sucked right! It lacked the magic of the first. You can actually understand every word the mice say, the animation is crazy, the palace is very different from the first movie. There are new characters that have never been mentioned and were terrible. Unfortunately, the Prince did not have many lines that kept him. of sound silly. Basically, it's like The Lion King 1 1/2 except its various stories all told by the mice. The reason I give it a 2 out of 10 is because the songs that were not sung by the characters were most enjoyable.
