Istanbul is another of the vast films that Errol Flynn made in the last decade of his life to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. It's a reminder of the Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner movie, a decade ago, Singapore. <br /> <br /> Unlike the studio product, Istanbul benefits from the fantastic location cinematography right in front of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was exponentially obsolete before the camera in each movie, was too old to stop playing this action / adventure style. His plays with Cornell Borchers have a real lack of conviction. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she plays Errol's former darling who has been traumatized by a fire to be saved from a fire. She doesn't know Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after a few diamonds that came into his possession. I have to handle it too. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people do not realize today that Cole was a complete jazz pianist, but they only think of him as a singer. Actually, he was first a pianist, the song was a memory. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for those who are fans of that kind of movie.
