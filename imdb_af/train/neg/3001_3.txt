Pass High the Story of Revenge by a Nasty Man who has become a victim of one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately after the promising opening, the movie went straight to hell. A very boring and unnecessary mess with mediocre slashings and a last half hour sucking on a whole new level of sucking. The man who played the nerd actually released him shortly after the movie. If you want to rent the movie, stop it at the prank and remember, choose life.
