I'm surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series will actually recognize responsibility. The writing is so unique, it must be written by someone who failed the admission exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers Association (and that says something!). Get out of your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing like joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett had to break flat to despise himself with this junk. The rest of the cast was so lacking in any kind of acting or comic ability that I was amazed at, the last episode has endured - correction, beyond the auditions. All I can say to those amused by it is that they have to be entertained very easily. And it is clear that the production cost had to be â‚¤ 100 per episode. And just if someone thinks I'm commenting as a stranger unfamiliar with English humor, I must add that I'm indeed English.
