To be honest, I didn't have an "Executive Decision" - it was clearly the template - but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not just those The people moving in the movie (the term actors would be an insult to all other actors) must attend more theater classes, the man who builds the environment doesn't even have a plane seen from afar. It's so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance is on board, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogical (eg use sleeping pads, don't use them, then use them anyway), which ultimately brought down my rating. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun in Rearranging your socker or drilling a hole in your knee and filling it with milk.
