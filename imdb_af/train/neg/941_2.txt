This movie is just bad. It is not even worth watching to enjoy it. The mad professor is just annoying. Even the suspension of unbelief to allow invisibility (which I do brilliantly for the sake of good bad movies) and allow for many lethal victims in a horror movie, even more than that, asks this movie. If you're looking for women's locker rooms, and random sexual encounters, get a porn, if you're looking for a good bad movie, get something different. If you just want to waste your time on an annoying bad movie, rent it.
