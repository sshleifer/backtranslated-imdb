The actual shame of "The Gathering" is not in the bad play, nor is it in the impossible level ground. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series it started, though it had one of the main draws: Takashima. I'd love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. She has those sarcasm, that white, that double-edged personality that is unstable and loving at one time. Unfortunately, the "Babylon 5" movie has an incredibly boring story that includes murder. Patricia Tallman - who has never returned very seriously to the series - has fortunately become much better with the age like Lyta Alexander, who is no more than a cunning, disappointing telepath. I'll leave you with one last thought - why is Delenn looking like a kind of outdoor space frog (though she is a woman)? Thanks for the way the Minbari looked later in the show.
