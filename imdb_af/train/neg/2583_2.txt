Another American Pie movie is slipped into our throat and this one is the worst one of them all. It does not deserve the name American Pie. They had to stop at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie just feels like a stupid porn movie that they have slammed on the title American Pie. When I saw it, I felt I had looked at another series. It's not like American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and has much more sex scenes than the other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. Actually, I don't recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just stick to the pretty original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
