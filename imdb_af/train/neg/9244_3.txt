One can handle historical inaccuracies, but this movie was just too much. Virtually nothing was even close to the truth, and even for that era it was considered stupid. <br /> <br /> In defense of Ford, it was unveiled on an old talk show, working on the story as told to him by the real Wyatt Earp, who was apparently old, senile, and the scene on his own way. Earp told the director about the stage coach and how it was planned to arrive at the stage carriage, Wyat himself said it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This film depicts Earp as an honest man and also his brothers. History doesn't say they were or were not. Most people like to include a bit of fraud and lawlessness in their characters, but it's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them than the legal obedience of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old West, didn't have the time to think too much. <br /> <br /> Non-existent characters depicted characters die at the corral that really hasn't done, everyone makes it a weaker movie. It is further weakened by Adult, who really didn't make a convincing doc. He may be the worst choice for Doc, but at the same time, remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a sense of truth. At that time Ford got the first hand from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It's also weakened by all the predictable events in the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro-Nazi at that time, and is ready to kill dark women in a very predictable way to show their protest to Hitler idealism. It takes place in most movies until the eighties. It is no excuse, and indeed the art cheap. <br /> <br /> The actors playing the Earps are doing well, and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, Adult can be the only drawback to this movie. Yet, it's the worst of the old OK Corral movies.
