I did not read a single IMDb commentary on this movie, which mentions how the Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down as a baby was shot like a rifle in a racist skin in his face while the movie look at the main black character in strictness <br /> <br /> I don't know how anyone can regard it as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance as they are supposed to be and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make such characters caricature. <br /> <br /> On the surface he tries to portray the character of Ice Cube. As a bad man, Remy provokes to become a racist skull. But who is studying at the end in the film's redeeming epilogue? Singleton points seem to be white or not able to empathize (I didn't say, sympathetically!) With his fellow black student OR just take the path of a racist skull. Many people who have been tormented by people from another race are not used to extreme inconvenience. <br /> <br /> Also raped women do not immediately become lesbian, which is more than a cult portrayed as a lifestyle. Very honest, what was the point?
