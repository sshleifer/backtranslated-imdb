I have no idea how anyone has managed to stay awake during this show. The play was ham-fist and amateur, the story was old news, and the development of the plot (or lack thereof) always dropped my eyelids less than halfway through each episode. It's about all that is to say about it, because it really didn't have any kind of thing. <br /> <br /> How do you like people like crap so much? It's freaking stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I don't even know how to explain it further. It is as if some of you will stare in an unashamed way, just because you look at the way some of the actors look or because for whatever crazy thing I've seen the same formulas in dozens of times before. shows. <br /> <br /> I just forgot. This show sucked, and fortunately it was gone forever. I wish they would work at the O.C. to demolish. once and for all.
