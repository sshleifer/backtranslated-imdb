After hearing raves about this movie for years, I finally decided to rent and watch it. Let me start by saying that I am pleased that the rent was free at the local library. This move was slow, boring, unrealistic, and the plot had no meaning. After 2 hours I was ready to take the Texas village back and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just don't understand the hype I heard from this movie. Dallas provides such good details of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money for judges to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
