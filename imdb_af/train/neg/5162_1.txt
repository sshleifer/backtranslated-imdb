This film reminded me so little of a "History of Violence" that pretends to be a close study of violence and violent action, but ultimately nothing less of a cheap action movie that is considered an imaginary film about violence do not become. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and meet endless harassment of the local drunks who do nothing but hang out at the bar all day and make trouble. Don't these men have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes everything he can and by the end of the movie he stays in his house and fights each of the drunken attackers in such a horrible manner as boiling whiskey over someone's throats, feet shot by shotgun and some blown head is caught in a bear trap. Funny that somebody needs such a big crap in a small British town, except maybe a man's head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah who made the "Wild Bunch", which also makes the subject of Blood violent where no one is spared. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw Dogs are not credible. First, the location is wrong and does not work. Why put it in England? I might think in some downtown or a small town in the American South in the 1930s or something. Secondly, it is not, in my opinion, ever clearly explained why these men are so violent, except perhaps they got drunk and needed Hoffman to rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah missed the point. this one.
