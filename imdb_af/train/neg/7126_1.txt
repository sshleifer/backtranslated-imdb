I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I couldn't really believe it. I laughed so hard at what had to be the worst written and in the history of man. I was seriously worried that I would have a heart attack and die in the theater. <br /> <br /> So it's the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother's accident and his brothers' car exploded, just away from him (the hero). The "hero" threw the expected "fitness" to see something so tragic and people tried to stop him from keeping off the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of his fitness and his uncontrollable anger / emotional breakdown, he says "I'm so sad" - he said right? Am I crazy?
