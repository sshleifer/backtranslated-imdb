I recently watched this movie on DVD and I have to say I wasn't impressed. I know it is taboo to beat independent movies, but this one was without entertainment. <br /> <br /> The point of departure was interesting, but its implementation was short. I thought myself "okay, they just come in, the story will pick up soon". Before I knew it, the movie was over and the story never picked up. I can't say I found the acting both impressive. It was pretty bad. Not Star Wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad but. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the running time was, I'll take two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the movie was finished, I felt as though I deserved some kind of recognition for the willpower I had to not stop the movie and walk halfway through. <br /> <br /> Again, I was thoroughly unobstructed and eventually bored from my mind. I'm not one of those guys who need quick action and explosions in a movie, so don't start on me because that's why I don't like it.
