Julia Roberts obviously makes a joint effort to shake her cotton wool Pretty Woman persona with this ghost abuse thriller, but it's hard to think she'll eventually make a show so powerful and convincing (and win oscar) as she did. Erin Brokovich based on the back of this litter. And don't bother about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately her performance isn't the most thoughtful thing. <br /> <br /> The plot has all the marks of a late night made-for-cable, and shouldn't be under the impression that it will provide any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse, because not of the characters are sketched enough to really care for you. <br /> <br /> Eventually disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Roberts's name above the title, I'm sure it would be fair.
