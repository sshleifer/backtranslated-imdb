A big concept went wrong. Poorly acting, worse writing .... After I watched the first two episodes, I wondered why it ever made two in the season. The characters are forgotten, the writing is poor, the sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - so much better done in the same time frame - where does the money go to this one? The first episode starts interesting and then goes off fast - the prescription of the whole show is just stupid. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Sci-Fi fan and 'geek' - but this view simply doesn't cut it. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised that it played twice - so much better after just one season canceled (for example, Jake 2.0). This show was just bad.
