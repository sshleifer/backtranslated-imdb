Extremely dull drama with a very young Roddy McDowall, training a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and the only reason to watch the movie in the first place. Dressed in blaring, remaining music and deviated from a schematic dialogue, it is one of the undeniable films that leads you to the point of a knee headache. The naffly-titled successor, 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', in which McDowall leads the next generation of night, is marginally better than the original, but the pace remains slow and the score continues to suppress you, but there is at least one or two scenes that do not cause a coma.
