I attended one of the premiers last night and had the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you have a ton of music videos, doesn't qualify you to make movies. The movie had an abundance of dipping shots that didn't make sense, terrible angles and terrible lighting. The editing didn't really help this mess. When "Dixie" arrives late for the memorial service, her mother comments on her hand, but it's never clear what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot promised, but the writing was thin and full of Ford Truck size holes. We never understand what the characters are driving, which is really behind the conflicts that everyone has or exactly how they solve it. Sixteen years of distance are extinguished in 4 days, apparently by magic. The deep conversations were destroyed by stupid clichés. (In fact, the whole town was one big cliché of southern life.) Half the audience greeted Toby as he pulled out: "You got my blood through your veins gurl" ... and we were not treated once the petty line, but TWICE! The revelations were yawn inducing, and the dramatic confessions boiled down to "I was dumb and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. The play was okay considering the wreckage of a script they had to work with. Toby was dark and broke most of the movie, but when he smiled and relieved, he was charming. It is a pity he had no longer screen time. Kelly Preston's acting links are pretty rustic and show it. Lindsay Haun is talented and definitely not her fault. The authors made her character so unpleasant that you didn't blame her father for not looking for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this movie, but lost more or less. (And indeed, their characters are lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you're a Toby fan, you'll love the songs. But often the movie felt like a scene was forced just to record one of its songs - or the artists on its record label. For example, the movie's official love song is "Crash Here Tonight". You might think it would be a loving scene, but no ... we hear about 45 seconds while he goes to a memorial service. It was as if they had said "Well, we have to use this song somewhere". The song "Broken" is ghostly and the best thing to come out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary ... a promising plot never develops fully and the movie is terribly uneven, as it is trying a vehicle for Toby Keith's music and product placement for Ford Trucks. It's about building people bridging bridges to try out the power of music, but the story is so badly told that both points are lost in this overgrown music video. I love Toby and would like to keep "Broken Bridges", but the people he aimed at dropping this movie deserve one of his famous boots you know where.
