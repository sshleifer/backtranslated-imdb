Give what a movie! I said that for decades I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies, so I decided to start with this one. It was a pretty good choice. I made this adventure to get lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I didn't see anything in the pastel debris. I haven't watched many bad movies yet, but I have the feeling that it's so "bad, it's good", probably because it's so unknowingly funny! First, there are the inaccuracies. There are plot-related inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter is in particular as insane as Van Damme's donkeys in the blue spandex. There are also extremely tough lines and I won't even move on some of the hilarious action. There isn't actually any bad thing about everyone involved in the hot rubbish of a movie, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic like Frank, who is a completely stupid character. And to tell the truth, I was really surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job of playing the twins. He managed to get a different tone and mood in the two roles that were convincing to me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sadness is that it was produced by a large film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
