Holy crap! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and finally started the other night. I watched an hour or so before going to bed. I was very inspired by the whole thing. I finished it last night and couldn't believe where I stopped the previous night. I literally stopped it the second time before the movie went completely down. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was very excited and curious about where this mystery went but stopped right when Simon put the package in the bar. I picked up when he opened the package to reveal a laser gun and then played a "threatening" laser tag game. Wow! Then the big revelation is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role-playing nerds. Wow! You can say that the Spanish industry was definitely behind director Mateo Gil (co-author of Amenabar's two major previous hits). There is an excellent score and good photography. But this scenario series of silliness. How someone has been sitting with a straight face for the last 40 minutes is outside me.
