In some ways, the concept behind the storyline was an interesting combination of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so obvious that it didn't earn tremendous close-up shots. I felt as if I had been hit with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease that killed people. <br /> <br /> The author simply removed clich√©s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to real characters. The actors didn't help. No chemistry. I think they had to develop a kind of attraction if that's just the reason it's an essential element of these stories. However, the authors did not work very hard to develop chemistry. Certainly, they are attractive, but whether they are attractive to one another, an open question appears. <br /> <br /> The confidence of Turner's character shows in Sabato's development is too fast and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't play the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character in "Independence Day." Usually that kind of character is supposed to show some kind of talent or brilliance. Sabato's character does not. He is Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magical eight ball. He seems to be random. <br /> <br /> The dead scenes are comical. Every actor really tried more than a little too hard to show the suffering. The symptoms look like a bad clay, like the 80's video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
