Anyone who has Tammuz's kids' nets knows it's a director who can do better. Let's hope this wasn't a case of too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And that was a case of the second feature jitters. The characters are one dimensional and over used. The scenery, however, is wonderful and shows the Pacific Northwest beautifully. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful. Shoots almost completely outside, the images are sharp and beautiful. You can almost blow the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is as healthy as it gets - it just has a heart failure.
