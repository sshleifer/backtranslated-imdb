After looking at it, I thought to myself, there were too few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie anyway. Awful in a way that is not fun, but rather makes you teeth and trembles. Make you scream "it's wrong" at the movie. Immersion is zero. By now, most of you are probably accustomed to the terrible errors / strangers in movies that hackers etc have in them. This movie is so in every way. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope she grows up and makes it worth at least something. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor. Don't look at this. There is not even proper action in it. Total waste of time.
