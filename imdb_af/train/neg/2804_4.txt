I was probably spoiled by first seeing the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I just got no chemistry between the two main stars. Staring and acting, it just doesn't do me, and what was it all about Tim in the role of Rochester. The casting director actually read the book. Very strange! He's a good actor, but definitely not Rochester! And Sela was, well, strange, a bit of a mix that made it fit. In his favor, the supporting role-player was pretty good and the Lowood screens for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall didn't catch the magic of the novel. Surely no one will ask to regard it as a true adaptation of the novel. A true deviation!
