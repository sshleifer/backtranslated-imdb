How many times do we see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is a kind of original, but the movie itself is a complete failure. For one thing, the dialogue is poorly developed, it is boring and wasting too much time on trivial details, the acting is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this rent stinks worse than a skunk.
