LOC could have been a very well-made film about how the Kargil war was fought; It had the places, the budget and the skill to be India's "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it appears as a bloated, 4-hour drill to attempt to report the war movement with the masala movie. Even the war styles have been terribly executed, with the same hill in all their battlefields, and spending unnecessary time on casual talks. Instead of calling on the Indian public, a better movie would be a glimpse of what happened at Kargil (such as "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time on a militant point (such as "Tora, Torah"). , Torah "). Better still, a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma could use to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, I'd like to see someone reshape this movie, including just the appropriate parts; This will make the movie more viewable.
