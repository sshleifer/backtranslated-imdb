The amazing "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after the "Butterfly". I had such high expectations for the actress, and then she goes from bad to natural WORSE in this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, it was the 80's and I have to tell you Harold Robbin's work was obscured by clever writers. Jacqueline Susann caught up with him (she wrote women's way of writing), Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course, Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the early 70's in the early 80's and then Jackie Collins came as women stronger and equal to men in all respects in her books, even more. That's why this work melts. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosene on a fire. The supporting role was also not a help. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was terrible to look at it and even 20 years later it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all shot when it was done. It will be difficult for Pia to deliver herself as an actress (although John Waters pours her into Hairspray, was a spark), though she has a good singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. Hair spray can go on tour! Join the show. You may be the greatest return story. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie for you if you do.
