Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring film maker, lives in a battered NYC apartment and relies on his mother to help make the lease. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not be married, but who wants Aldolpho to die in his movie. When Al unexpectedly found a financial promise of funding for his movie from a strange man named Joe, he thought he had made it. This is until Joe Al takes an adventure to steal a Porsche for some of the financial support. Will the movie be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And will Angelica star in the movie? According to this viewer, it's a terrible movie. The script is uncomfortable, with a plot that wanders willy nilly. Beals understands all her lines, and Buscemi is unavailable. There are quite a few insatiable materials and indifferent characters to start. Finally, the production values ​​are also very poor, and the film is second time at all times. If you have time on your hands, it's still a good idea not to have a chance with this movie. But if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and look at the darn thing. Beals look pretty, though.
