I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it wasn't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and I'll take this time to ignore Kris Aquino's about this. and ... end. <br /> <br /> I really avoid Pinoy horror movies because stories don't have originality and I really think (some) authors don't pay enough attention to the characters (and their progress) in their stories (superfluous ??). It was as if they were pushing the movie when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to jerk off other movies. why ?? why did this movie get a good review? I won't earn that much. the movie was so frightening, but the movie was more freaky as it is about Filipino folklore ... it's in my list of "most likely case" category. I just wished they were spending more time improving the story lines and resolving the flashbacks, no matter if the lighting was sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away. Sayang.
