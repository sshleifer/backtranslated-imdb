I'd give this movie zero out of ten, but I'll give it a two. Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a face with Kamal. I love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. That's why I didn't enjoy kissing her in this movie, but it's not a big problem. Anyway, enough of the bedroom scenes that made this movie noticeable, we can actually talk about this movie. It's good or bad, I think it's a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn. I am a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review by clicking on my name, I have good taste. The movie is not entertaining, is one thing and if it is supposed to be hard work, there is no morale in this movie. It's a biased movie, it's not a real story and it stinks. If Kamal watches these actresses kiss me, I'm sick, man can't kiss at all.
