What kind of sh * t is it? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was vigilant and as good as the first movie in the beginning, but the part where the lead actors get superpowers in their dreams has begun to become childish. This sh * t should be rated PG or PG-13. I expected to see many adult stuff, but it was only for 1/3 of the film. The rest is for small children. Plus it is too much focused on Christianity. I know Freddy is a devil, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting demons. Why should it always be Christianity? It is total orientalism and filled with white people's / westerner's superiority. Don't 'look it up, show it to small children who love the watchmen.
