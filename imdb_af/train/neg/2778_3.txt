This movie looked like it was all about good camera, sound, movie, sets, music, costumes ... but tricycle, Gary Stretch spoke! I don't know if it was his poor or just a bad manuscript, but would say it was both. For the sake of his decision in this role, I found it difficult to root even to the end. I wanted him to die in battle or one of the sword / knife spread. <br /> <br /> Then the cup was to kill the king, because the king had no sex with his family. Queen? Nice lamb. And to go the extra mile to kill her own son? And then her lover presses as king? I see a wire or two here and there of historical grips, but the way it is all presented was over. <br /> <br /> I don't recognize Gary Stretch of anything else, but he was terrible. I read another user's comment on sound being baptized, but don't think she was baptized ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was really awful. The lines were read to the right of the shoulder's table ... flat line. It may be that he just doesn't have the voice to carry tone fluctuations. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I watched it to the end, so the movie had at least an "interest". It could have been more if the writing / lines and casting were given more work. The landscape and filming team with a very good quality film is what really made this film above all. The cast and the story were all secondary. I give the film staff a 10.
