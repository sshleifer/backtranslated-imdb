"Nat" (pronounced by Trevor Gagnon), along with his brainiac friend "IQ" (pronounced by Philip Bolden) and the always hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon. The Apollo 11 is waiting for its historic journey on the track near where the three go. <br /> <br /> The first thing you see is the animation of the movie. I did it very well. The scenery was deep, as things seemed to be behind the scenes in the distance. I didn't see the movie in 3-D, as it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that there were no scenes that made use of the 3-D effects, except a battle between characters near the end. Also, I was not really impressed with the design of the characters. To me it doesn't look like anything that looks like a fly, especially in color. The flies were an unusual blue-gray that so distracted me. <br /> <br /> The cast of the cast wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story. The writing is certainly written for a younger audience, with comical moments that will make younger children laugh. I have seen nothing for adults, such as jokes that they will get the adult punchline to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> History was not followed in this movie. In fact, I think it's completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies. I also hated when a famous astronaut appeared on the screen explaining that the stories about the flies in the film were a work of fiction, and no flies were on Apollo 11. I looked like he thanked the men and women having sacrificed what they did live for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you're an adult, it's not for you. It wasn't made for the whole family. It's definitely just for kids. But, except for this one for a rainy day.
