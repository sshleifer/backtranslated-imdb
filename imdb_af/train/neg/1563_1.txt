I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was amazed at how bad it was, but based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. It is thought to be a "mockumentary" of two high school students who make a high school documentary school. It has bad acting, bad directing, totally lacking in alluring characters as written, and everything is a complete bust. I love good movies about high school, and that's not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-consciously "cool", although they have to be rejected. You get the overall impression of a lot of people sitting around making a deliberate bad movie to show their friends, but somehow it came to Sundance. Mystifying.
