I will say so much - This director is all about RAW images ... things are most of us who are not right to confront mainly. Images of sex, suicide, murder and people who relieve themselves are constantly obstructing the viewer. It makes me wonder if the director tried to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I don't think I can ever see this movie again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some very nice shots and "photo moments" in the movie (the fans, the wire fish in their hair), but the story needed me to have more (strictly in the time after we asked ourselves: "What did we do? Just see?"). <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to easily gag or vomit, you can't see this movie.
