As a true Elvis fan, this movie is a total embarrasment and the writing is a disaster. The movie opens with the beautiful boy "Stay Away" and the landscape of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope for something special. Elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted a lot of time, especially on the rest of the featured songs. I have been through this movie twice just to make sure it is a piece of junk !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
