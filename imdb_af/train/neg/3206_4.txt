I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language. (Not "dialect" as most Philippines call it wrong. If Cebuano and Tagalog are mutually incomprehensible as French and Spanish, it is for each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. As Canadian, from Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this movie. I was further excited to hear that it wasn't another silly movie or melodrama, as Philippines loves these kind of movies. But unfortunately, I was briefly changed. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serves as an ego journey for Cesar Montano. Of course, Montano plays the hero of the movie. And if I say 'hero', I mean in the most stereotypical ways; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bol anon to victory against the Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. He suits the heroam. The rest of the characters are one dimensional; they all roll their cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow moving / meditative movies, but this movie was just moving slowly. It didn't really meditate on anything. Just because a movie is a historical theme, a drama and slow motion doesn't make it a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> Particularly annoying is American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan movie industry, he really had to think it through. He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, but really this movie would be fired at such festivals. To get Visayan movies into the mainstream consciousness, he had to have at least made a movie that attracted audiences, even if it meant sacrificing quality. It was clear that he didn't think or was receiving information about what kind of movie awards were in Cannes, so an audience-loving movie would have been at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm scared that Visayan movies won't be made long because of this movie. If I ever told a Filipino that I would of course like to see more Visayan movies, I would get an answer: "Visayans don't make good movies. Didn't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" This is, of course, ridiculous, as it is one example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example one will see today. <br /> <br /> An example of meditative movies not only moving slowly is the Tagalog movie Blackout or David Lynch's The Straight Story. I hate to promote the Tagalog language because it is infinitely and unfairly promoted and moved into the funnel of non-Tagalog Filipinos, but for the sake of a spade calling a spade, I say Blackout is a VERY GOOD movie . These movies depend on what Hitchcock calls 'pure cinema'. Images without words are used to convey the story. But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they just take the shooting of the landscape, then they fix the mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino movies with a dying mother or grandma ???
