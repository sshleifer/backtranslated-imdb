Well, my good, I'm disappointed. When I first heard the news of a reminder of Robert Wise's 1963 film The Haunting, I was afraid it would be destroyed by an abundance of summer movie size visual effects. But deep, I had faith. Certainly, with such a talented throw intact ... De Bont and the company won't ruin a movie, whose original was a fantastic and terrifying film that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtle, where are you now !! ?? My fears revealed ... a promising movie went wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw; the film is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do wrong. But, the writing suggests it's good actors on trial. They are named to deliver the kind of stylized dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only artist to escape with some dignity ... and it's scarce. But the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, feel that terrible fear of the unknown fear. No, we get some visual effects to show us what we should be afraid of. And you know what? As wonderfully realized as they are ... the visual effects come down as a kind of fool. And the climax is a fantasy-magical debris ... but things went awry for a long time. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is exaggerated and overblown. I'm afraid there's no real excitement or creaking in these old haunted monsters ... just groaning. Rather look at the original. <br /> <br />
