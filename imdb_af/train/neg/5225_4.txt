This Drummond entry is unfinished. Most of them have their elements of sotiness, the delayed wedding, and so on. However, it has an endless series of events that occur in the dark, as the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who doesn't even look at anyone. He is a stranger and rather suspicious, but Drummond and the people don't seem to pick up anything. However, it is a reasonably good action and a good end. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movie, he's so buffoonish that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence around him. Is there a history behind him explaining how he and Drummond became associates?
