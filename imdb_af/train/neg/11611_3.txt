Lady in Cement - PI spoof with Ole Blue Eyes. Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny "comedy". Through an annoying and repetitive Hugo Montenegro score and a bunch of misfiring punchlines. This 1968 movie is never mentioned above. A bit too bawdy to be made on television for television movie status. Dan Blocker is effective in Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia's big gallout role and Raquel Welch has to thank her personal coach. The only thing worth watching or watching the DVD is the Welch movie chassis collection such as Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you left the predictive film over the DVD and go to the trailer library in the special features. In addition to tons of myoginist asides, Sinatra lisps @ the gay owners of the local Go-Go bar. A remnant that needs to be brought back into the timepiece. D
