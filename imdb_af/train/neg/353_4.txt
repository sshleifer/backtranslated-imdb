As other reviewers have noted, the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. But before that, it's predictable and an incredible vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who never found her character clear and ruined every scene she's in. Connery is good like Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than the truth that dominates the whole. with a sense of unreality. And the end is simply bizarre. The filmmakers apparently knew when they joined this mess. All they needed was tasty potatoes and pumpkin pie to have a Tuesday afternoon. To compensate, they added an overwhelming "dramatic" score. Each jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestra, to the point where it is laughing. If you want an example of big league bad movie, it's one to watch, otherwise it will skip.
