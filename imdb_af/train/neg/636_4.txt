A few farmers are struggling in life in a small town in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, becoming his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the front roles, speak with false accents and emphasize ancient stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good woman, many kids and country are the best things for men to have. They are seen as property and investment. Because it's a big budget movie, in which many extras work together, big sets are built and special effects take place, the filmmakers can't risk renting less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Oscar for this show, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives a better performance and shows his talent again. Another problem with the movie is the end. Franklin didn't seem to know how to end the photo. This film can be dangerous if viewed as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
