For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I start with the bad. Bad points: The decisive choices (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), the play of the badly chosen cast, the storyline, the idea of ​​placing the movie in modern times, the direction, the editing, the soundtrack and most importantly the whole idea to make a movie from a television series that was not so nice with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> One can have an analogy here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke pushes her way to Michael Weston as Enos and asks the question, "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", In his cloud judgment, tell her where they are. could just as well have asked, "Enos, is this a good movie?", the red bikini would have darkened his judgment by saying yes, although he said in his right mind "No, not really." As good as she looked in the bikini, she could be sharply naked, and even that wouldn't have made this horrible piece of film. Get out of Hazzard!
