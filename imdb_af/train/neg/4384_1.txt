The fact that someone spent money on such a bad script is outside me. It really should be one of the worst movies, in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actors, and a very bad story. There are no normal reactions to any event in this movie, and although it is Halloween, normal people will have greater responses if they testify that their father is being murdered, not to speak, people with a band covering their airways, unable to breathe. (in a room with at least 50 people I can add) and a person dressed if Satan is dragging the dead people out of his house, even an 8-year-old would see the difference between a doll and a person . Not to mention the fact that nobody can possibly be the naive and stupid to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus' appearance on the same day, as this child does. When I was 8, I probably had more brain than that. <br /> <br /> But the very bad thing is that everyone else looks like this dumb Satan, also no questions asked. The question throughout the film is, is it really Satan, or is it a crazy person who kills people when he feels that way? Well, he has human hands, arms, built and whatever, so I think he should be in the movie, otherwise they did a great job hiding it. Then, when this person was man and everyone, he could kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) policemen (all with guns and training I suppose) and a few other people . .... and of course everyone is standing there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst I have seen, and I will never recommend anyone wasting 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total shit .
