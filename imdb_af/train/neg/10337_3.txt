Man the end of this movie is so terribly unavailable and dated that my whole movie aesthetics laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the movie was good. It had some unintentional funny scenes, but has some really good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a good director who made FLIGHT OF THE PHENOON and whatever happened to Baby Jane. The problem is not with direction, acting or anything technical. The film is only destroyed in the third law. Why? The murders, twists, turns and characters all threw around nuclear material? What was the scare the writer was smoking when he got through it? The way it just came from nowhere was perhaps the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's planet of the monkeys, the life of David Gale or infamous, I think this is the worst end ever. What a drop.
