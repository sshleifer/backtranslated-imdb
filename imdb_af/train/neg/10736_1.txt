The movie starts with an intriguing scene, drinking three people and talking small in a bar. All of them make a little outrageous stories. As the film unfolds, it seems that the most outrageous story is true. In addition, the movie is not very interesting, except for the scene in the pub and the main secret scene. This revelation hardly happens halfway through the movie and frankly, there's not much to see. The rest of the time director is asleep in a abandoned Russian village, full of pitiful and flu old ladies. Sure, it's fascinating and a little shocking, but to admire them is going too long, offering any possible plot or character development. I got this movie as another example of lousy or lazy movies. Instead of trying to make an interesting story, filmmakers focus on strange fascinating images and in a few almost unrelated stories (fallen in the point - storyteller's story) To leave the spectator to find all odds and ends . On the surface it has art display, but in this particular case nothing more than a lack of talent.
