Note to George Litman, and others: The Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is "I don't think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite reef is: "Why do you have his"? "for complete absurdity. That, and "Good, didn't do it!" All in all, I'd say we should give credit to the MST3K team to mock this TV movie. you can't really make much fun of the dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would deny it. a high school drama club can do better. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend buying a book and reading "Hamlet".
