I don't like this movie, but then I didn't think much about the book, although I praised many as a "masterpiece", I lacked character development and unpleasant and illogical in plot, though much more was. readable as Fante's terrible first attempt, "Road to Los Angeles", has not been published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> I was intrigued to see what kind of sweet Towne would make with so few ingredients. He worked hard to repair the many shortcomings of the book, but for my money it didn't save. There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while ever trying to stay true to the book. I consider this movie Towne's folly. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgotten.
