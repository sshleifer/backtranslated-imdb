When I was at school, I made a film about a few moving around in the trees, and I realized halfway through editing that it was not just a failed aesthetic strategy, but a click from the Canadian theater. welding steps loaded into social comments. But what feels like my own movie's failures, I feel much better after seeing it ... this ... thing. For one thing, mine ran for 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content: every senseless little business passed for four, five, six relentless minutes. The male lead is just incredible, a prosperous, moaning crawl given to outbursts of drama-class enhancement between philosophical insights thrown out of the T-bar, and he gets plenty of room for us to hate. Truly, if he wasn't such a ** hole, the third act would make even less sense, as some snarky dudes prevent far and proper improper echoes of 'exploitation' values ​​being provided; but it doesn't make it easier to see the crawled crawl screen "please" in close-up to the magazine. I recall what I said about AUTUMN USED, which at least had the courage of its own misguided lechery: this movie crater is and remains the worst Canadian movie of all time. At least I really hope so.
