The one sheet and newspaper campaign suggested (as often as they did) a much more lurid and violent piece than it appeared on the drives. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization by Claudio Brook, who has worked in films for many years. This one is rather difficult to find; I would love to see it again in comparison to other international horrors of the day, but don't remember me very much when. Chances are, this was an accelerated release made in America's theaters and video. But oh, that one skin ... still a jewel of my later horror collection.
