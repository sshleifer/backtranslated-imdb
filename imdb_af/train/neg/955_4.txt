I don't think a Hollywood story player lasted as long as David Niven had most of the bad movies he wore with his incredible charm. He could act, got an Oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one layer of two ply tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a case in point. It is a musical and for the most part you remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will remember that they are in Scot's costume while the film is presented in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can recall a single song from it, you need a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the American lead in a musical that apparently emerges from Edinburgh in Edinburgh. She starts in the choir and walks late one day. She gets a lift from the millionaire greeting card driver king. Everyone now assumes that she is the greatest pressure of the millionaire. Doors open as they have never opened before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with the various situations caused by the mistake. Cesar Romero has a few good moments here as the avid producer of this music. <br /> <br /> In the end, Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless fluff that David Niven has done so much and has become so tired.
