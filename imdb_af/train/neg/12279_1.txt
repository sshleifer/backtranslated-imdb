Although it looks quite an old show (2002), I watched my first episode last night and I must say it should be the worst show. . . ever. <br /> <br /> I'm not one for posting, but I was so shocked that there could be a blatant attempt, and I just assume it's their target audience, children under 12 old or people with less than average IQ. <br /> <br /> The episode I had last night contains so many different story lines, trying to record every possible plot plot, and trying to talk about friendship, family, religion and politics! !!. <br /> <br /> Basic story they covered in the episode: Frat House hazing went wrong with too much alcohol - Death seems to be Senator's son who wants FBI to investigate. Death is actually murder by peanut allergy. Senator believes it can be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did it because Senator took money for his legislative votes but eventually got a conscience and said "no" means multimillionaire. Everyone who is a suspect, but everyone has the usual alibi (former friend student who has seen a married teacher, so he had to lie, dissatisfied student reported by the victim, actually had life-changing experience. Senators enemy did not desperate students pay to kill sworn enemies, son, he gives money to many students who have been broken. All the time the heroine of this dribble has remained her cousin, who is 'at that age' and has a loved one for a boy, who eventually gets the courage to talk to her aunt, but only to dump him because the 'In' girls say he is not good enough and so they keep with him. Don't worry, she comes back with a boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls let her go, and Aunty also explains that God is the only one she can really trust (I was almost sick at this point) <br /> <br /> This drama is even better than Sue and her FBI team find out who is the killer. . . You will laugh at this, I sure did. . . <br /> <br /> It is one of the Frat boys who found out a year ago that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and he tries to make impressive real dad by killing a boy and planting bomb at funeral. . . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard, the play is cardboard, the continuity is cardboard, the story is cardboard. Anyone who says they love this show has cardboard for a brain. <br /> <br /> Why the authors of this show have tried to embrace every possibility in one show means that they obviously have no confidence in the character development or actor ability to perform a simple plot line. To watch this show is to look at 'Last Action Hero' with Arnie killing 5,000 people with a toothpick, except that Arnie is a better actor (wow, never thought there would be a day I would say it!) <Br> <br /> In the words of the Simpsons beloved character 'comic book guy'. . . . <br /> <br /> WORST TV SHOW. . . . . Ever.
