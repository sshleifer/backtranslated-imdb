I'm not really sure how to start describing how bad this movie is. I like bad movies because they are often the most entertaining ones. I like bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and dishonest direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I expected), this movie had all those features. <br /> <br /> The special effects were incredibly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch include the Thunderchild, the woman being broken by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck. Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the positive side, some plays from the alien walkers were well done. <br /> <br /> The play was about as bad as it could have been, and was directly on H.G. Wells's book based. To have such a good source material, it's almost as if the actors tried to be so cute to make it funny. And then there is the mustache ... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen long ago. Of course, only half of the movie contains acting. The rest are characters who run purposeful and poorly delivered shots. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an unfair director, will be an injustice for unfair directors. Using different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, using poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside screens, the bad green screen, makes me wonder how this man ever has permission to send a movie . I wouldn't think it would be possible to change a brilliant book into this bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone planning to watch this movie is to do what I did: have friends who enjoy bad movies, play poker while watching, drinking, and maybe You will make it all the way through. It makes for an excellent bad movie, so enjoy it and don't let yourself down with this disaster.
