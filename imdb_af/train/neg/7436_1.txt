This movie is a waste of time and money. During the whole hour and a half I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. It was slow moving, the plot jumping around, it wasn't scary or interesting, and never really went to anything. The credits during the introduction were long and issued, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and out). Several parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the movie I thought I might have "zoned" because the plot's accident my comrade had the same problem and assured me I didn't burst out of boredom, but it was indeed the movie. I have never actually made a movie about this and have been updating movies on IMDb for many years. The fact that I actually take the time to write something, therefore, must talk about volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
