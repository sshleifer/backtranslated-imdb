I never really thought a movie could be so horrible, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible consequences. The crocodile was awful and for the stupid sex / deadly scene in one, it was a bad move of the word. It was really shocking and not a compliment! How can anyone make this movie, look it back and actually say, "Yes, it's a good movie. People will see it." If you haven't seen it, I beg you, DO NOT BOTHER :-(
