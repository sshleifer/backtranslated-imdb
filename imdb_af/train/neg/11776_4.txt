Anyone with fairly good knowledge of the German cinema will surely tell you that many films about a young girl who has problems with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past. If such a movie is shown to people again, it will surely click provided it has something new, fresh and engaging for today's challenging audiences. This also applies to German filmmaker Sylke Enders, since her filmmaker Kroko, her film director, was abused by everyone around her, including her mother and boyfriend. She is brave enough to experience any punishment, as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities, including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot at DV to be blown to 35 mm format. His technical virtuosity does not hinder us when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman because she feels that she is angry with the idea of ​​running a mill-barber. If someone puts a positive aspect of Sylke Enders' film, it may be Kroko's involvement with disabled people because of a punishment. It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are also man with their unique joys and sorrows.
