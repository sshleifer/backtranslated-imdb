Filmed in a documentary style, but you can tell fairly well that participants are trained. A recently divorced wannabe filmmaker (Myles Berkowitz) sees the chance to educate his love life and enter into the movie breeze. He plans to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty dates, including the conclusions. The comedy is at best spotty; Unfortunately the rest is after accident. Also participating is Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the seductive Elisabeth Wagner. To try to be credible, Tia Carrere's fetch is spoken in a cameo. It will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date.
