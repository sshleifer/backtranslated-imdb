I watched this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. The quick summary of this movie should be avoided. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited and did not do any of these posts well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's attempt to capture in 1999 a part of the disputed region of Kashmir from India. . Presumably based on the fact, you get a hint of this movie of the troubles the Indian army had to regain the territory of Pakistani troops - which occupied the high ground. But instead of telling what a compelling and heroic story had to be, all that the film does, the Indian army looks, laughs and stupid, I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with an almost completely Indian audience, who was very patriotic and wanted this movie, but also found that they were laughing at the scene, which was not meant to be funny. don't be. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely abysmal. It gave the impression that Mr. Dutta knows nothing about how an army functions and uses bad war movies as a reference. The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The actions of most of the principals were not sterile, but the consideration given to the scriptures found it difficult to criticize them too much. Regarding the supporting role, all I can say is that I hope they are amateurs. <br /> <br /> Editing was also pretty bad. It was pretty difficult to follow what was happening much of the time, and music would suddenly end in the scene. <br /> <br /> Good things: The cinematography was pretty good, although it was a bit hurt because the film didn't seem to be color-coded (the color balance often varies between screens). Also, the few songs that were in the movie were quite nice - for the first half a dozen or so collection. Unfortunately, they went much longer than they needed to. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG. There is plenty here that a good editor can print out a good 1.5 - 2 hour movie that has been shot. Unfortunately, a good editor does not work on this movie.
