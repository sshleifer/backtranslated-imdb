Seriously, I read some of the reviews on this movie, and I have to ask if you are watching the same movie. Yes, I give the set of directors a lot of credit to be able to recreate Los Angeles 1930 vintage, but so what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are nice, the story looks aimless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (and his character "Homer Simpson" wished me the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had the creepy kid actor, creeper Billy Barty, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies movie loves and the rest of us are watching each other and going, "What's the heck!"
