If they could get Ed Asner, didn't they get other actors instead of people going to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character on the ground when he was never in danger. This forced the old man to mask the injury out of pride and so the young man would feel guilty and leave him with a life-long disability. I think that's why the main character refuses money and why does the old man work like a dog, even when he volunteers for extra work. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy, because he is a long-distance boyfriend, why is a soldier better. He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father. All the characters that are meant to be fun are not and everyone is the 'bad' boyfriend. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a sawmill?
