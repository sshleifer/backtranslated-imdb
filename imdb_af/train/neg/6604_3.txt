The first one was the best. The second one sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although the storyline was not so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie I taught a few times. I know Jackie Chan is a good martial art, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker wasn't good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, some rules, horrible acting (But it's based on her writing). All the characters there were not so good. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 are always the action and less sex scene. I know Jackie Chan doesn't do the things that are good for him.
