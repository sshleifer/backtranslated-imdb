Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by making the successor to the Universal Soldier. But, did that movie save him? I think he goes to hell when he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the bad man of the movie. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the acting (details follow). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (don't remember the name .... well, it doesn't matter) to escape some muscle people. Of course, they are the new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fought Goldberg, but then the "mission" stopped. It was just a test (Is this movie a test for our nerves?). It seems that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Whoever saw the first movie may think that is the most illogical thing Van Dammes can do). But it's a successor. And a "story" has to come up. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important to the story. <br /> <br /> Now, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation to shut it down and stop it. Of course, the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the facility BUT the computer sends a few soldiers to hunt him. (It wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he's the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a stupid sentence for the audience before being paid. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After a story, Van Damme tries to save his daughter (from his wife - the reporter in the first movie). It comes to a final show where Van Damme fights the Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (see yourself. It's just too funny to tell). <br /> <br /> You'll see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Don't look. But if you do, keep a sapack with you!
