To say this movie, stink will be offensive. As the others say, this movie is offensive to anyone over the age of 7 (it is particularly offensive to gays). It's terrible - and not in a "so bad it's funny" either - it's just awful. No, I have to say it: it stinks! (sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From the opening credits to the end titles, there is barely more than 10 seconds of this movie to open your eyes. The "plot" is incoherent, the characterization does not exist, the play is from the upper cup "look at me, I'm funny!" school and so it goes on. The prescribed pieces are in any case tidy and poorly executed. It's just terrible at every front. Except for the music, I don't remember the music stinking (except the songs). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the makers, they put their cards on the table very quickly: the opening credits include the title "Also with Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor" (since the particular meteorite never comes out never say anything else, but make an occasional noise, maybe Kitt's contribution to one of her records has been recorded) and the second line of the movie is as follows: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus. "Uranus -" Your Anus "said? geddit? huh? huh ?? Your Anus? The humor is really so cheap. It says strange things about the "comedies" of that period, because it was perfectly permissible for the hero to deliberately kill people in the street, but not to say "sh * t" aloud. <br /> <br /> I've been selling fifty pence ($ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I felt ripped off.
