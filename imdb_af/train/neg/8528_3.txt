What is written on the poster is: "At birth he lived 6 years to live. At 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime." Ami is an American-born Israeli who has been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of one. At the age of 34, after the love of his 22-year-old caregiver did not go well, he decided to come to the US to meet the doctor who said he would only have 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he was still alive, weighing 39 pounds. Why? You guess is as good as mine, even though I've seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it is courage to live when all he can do is his left index finger, but why does he have so much anger at the doctor? Who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor recently told his mother that people with medical history would not live long. What is the point of his appearing at the old doctor's door? Why is tracing this old US doctor a journey of his lifetime? There are so many things that might interest us in Ami's life: how can he make the animations with the movement of only one finger? How can he go through the daily lives, while it depends entirely on others? How did he live his doctor's prediction? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him, like looking at a strange being? The movie didn't tell us anything about it. Instead, the filmmaker got a bus and set up a trip to let Ami appear at his old doctor's door to show him he's still alive. I thought it was a joke.
