Untidy, relentless comedy that disregards the "classic" 50's "alien invasion" movies, but really no better than them, except of course in the purely technical section (good makeup effects). And any spoof worse than its target is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of the screaming voices of the strangers, you will beg for rest and silence. (* 1/2)
