I think it's possible I've seen worse movies, but this one is a real stinker! The plot is imperceptible, but it's not the worst. the direction is not as close to what you would expect from andy ching. He is able to get good work, but could not pull this movie together. <br /> <br /> Angie Harm plays the female head as a reporter who fights in the background of the assassination of the president, has really slaughtered the role. There was no chemistry with kindness, her attitude was flat and wood, and the 5-inch nail hooks she wore through the film were absurd. This outing for harmony places her solid on the bottom of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> What was Cuba's thinking? He has a number of outstanding performances, but it was far below what we expected from him. <br /> <br /> The poor James Woods and the disappearance. poor poor poor poor poor.
