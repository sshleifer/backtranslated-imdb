To watch this movie for action is rather a waste of time, because the figureheads on the ships perform better than the people. It's a grace that Anthony Quinn can't convince anyone else to lead him to other turkeys. <br /> <br /> But it's filled with entertainment, as Yul Brynner has her, Lorne Greene shows an unconvincing French accent, and the rest of the big names stretch into the comic-book mode.
