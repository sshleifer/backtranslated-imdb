Okay, it's gona, short and sweet review. Something that the movie had to do was shorter and sweeter its life than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason why there was a petition with more than 40,000 + signatures. ALL claimants Yours Boll stops making films of franchises people would like. Rayne's blood is a biggie there. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard a thousand times before. The act is descent, but you can really just blame the writing for it. I even wondered for a few moments if they even used a script. <br /> <br /> The movie has little to do with the original games. HELLO If you played the games, you know the main character has no real motivation outside of murderous drugs such as mass murder, as he knocked his toes or simule. There is too much story for such a silly movie. as I said. I won't even steal this movie. And for the person who says it is 'Fungste movie of 2007' .......... look, the news is better than that.
