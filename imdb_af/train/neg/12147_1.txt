This is perhaps the worst attempt to have a zombie movie I ever had to see the accident. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. Of course, any review found on this site is the work of the filmmaker, filmmaker or filmmaker's friend. How does this movie suck? Let's count the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Horrendous. I won't be shedding the bonds as I understand it's a low budget. But was there even one zombie that wasn't obese? C'mon! And for a movie in Rhode Island, why did that truck have a Massachusetts sign? Continuity, find a few. <br /> <br /> The girl is dancing while the soldier is "paying attention". Please, do not naked your ex-girlfriend or girlfriend's sister in your movie. It was an ugly movie filled with ugly people and no business to mention Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, don't do it.
