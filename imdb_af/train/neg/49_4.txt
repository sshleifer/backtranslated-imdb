A very cheesy and dull road movie, aimed at being hip and modern, is shown in the editing style and some strange camera angles, which only results in drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the leading Lalo Schifrin soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Begin if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this movie are completely earned; it's really pure garbage. Of course it has its charm to watch a movie where everyone would not drop the beer glass when it was on fire, but it saves for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.
