The only redeeming quality of this movie is the real storyline ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the set design was cheesy and very tough. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch because of all the hearing observers. I would not recommend looking at this one. The only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive. Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera player. Some of the editing was done well, but there are continuity errors all over the place. I'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad. Can we get a good one soon?
