This is a simple story, but it is very manipulative. It has no pathos because it does not leave room for imagination or personal thoughts or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I feel it is too promising. I would have wanted more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe it wouldn't feel so kitsch. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood-style movie it works OK, but it is very distracted from Aardman movies and it bothers me. Perhaps a longer movie will test whether this maker can do without the voice over. <br /> <br /> I think the voice over is too slippery.
