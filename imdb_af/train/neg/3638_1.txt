The film portrays France's unsolved problems with its colonial legacy in West Africa (France) Africa through the satisfying and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (she represents symbolically). It is a often impressive and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to achieve a traumatic moment in her past in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the "other" that once. owned and formed. This is reflected in the way it completely revolves around the idea of ​​travel (or transit) of the present to the past; recalls realities to unimaginable contemporary political and economic topicalities. <br /> <br /> The characters all play a symbolic, though limited, and unconvincing role. France, which is intended to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to her fate as she is still apparently with the same naive, which she, as a child, enjoyed. a child looks. She looks more in possession of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgotten. The black Afrikaners are at least the offensive impressive portraits of former colonial peoples now colonized by the director's poor handling of her material. They are no more than a dark and deadly backdrop against which the gay France is looking for a world she never knew, and hopes for someone who can never be found in Cameroon.
