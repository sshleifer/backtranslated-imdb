This movie doesn't really promote children and has better attitudes, like a family movie, and it won't be considered a family anyway, because it has a few things that children shouldn't see. Not the best ABC family movie if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie, then maybe it's better. Hollywood does nothing to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least it's a TV movie. I don't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do than watch this movie, please go to them.
