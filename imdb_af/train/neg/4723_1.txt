First, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone from ex-Yugoslavia who is not an extreme Serbian radical will agree with me. This movie, see the Serbian side, and only the Serbian side. No Serbian crimes were represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this movie was made by Serbians, so there is no neutrality. All '' professionals '' interviews are not professional at all. Some people just read a book written by a radical Serbian, the other one is genocide denier etc.etc. <br /> <br /> Even Slovenians have been accused in this movie. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for a few days. just because Slovenians were happy. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the war in Croatia and Serbia began). Every Slovenian is furious with all the accusations in this movie. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croatia would agree with one thing: Independence was too early. Perhaps all major conflicts can be avoided. To name the Second World War and some unrelated things, however, was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. Just imagine that Japanese nuclear bombs throw in Seattle and Washington, saying it is justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence of the famed YNA soldier, and have killed Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the band with reporter committing his claims to Serbian civilians near Vukovar. Across the Internet. And the director forgot to call the entire bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now on Serbia and Montenegro's side and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrin). And let's not start with the Chetnik movement. At first, it was simply a resistance movement. But director somehow forgot to call co-operation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing, and once again fighting the Yugoslav Slavic parties. There are thousands of other things, but it can be easily checked. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only a few of all accusations are true. Every Croatian is furious about this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe I shouldn't call Srebrenica genocide, the genocide that has too much evidence. Imagine the film about denying the holocaust. This movie is the same. And according to this film, Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombarded themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is furious about this movie. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the director forgets to name the small occupation of the Macedonian (FYROM) land by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnians and Macedonians never entered the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian and you actually started something from this movie, you know that Serbs have a kind of propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs who made their history. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs say this movie is '' small '' extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And Serbian radicals are very, very happy with this movie (there are about 40% Serbs who vote for radical). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this so-called documentary is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: Imagine watching this movie. Then you will just laugh at all the pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See true, neutral documentaries on Yugoslavia's death.
