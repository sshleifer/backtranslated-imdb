TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20s during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and being revived when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The question is where the filmmakers are serious or joking when they made this film? If it's serious, it's a nice bad movie and a good movie to pick up its bad. If it's a comedy, it's less good but funny for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh long and hard. This movie, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
