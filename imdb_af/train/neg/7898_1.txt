When I saw this movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where these hilarious creatures, garbage dumps with big pointed teeth, were really scary? Or where they designed to have a good laugh (I hope so). If you look carefully, you can even see the strings they manage (better; drag them across the screen). The whole was quite funny as scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed at its total inability to have just one good part. It's a big joke from start to finish and I believe this movie is in a new category: So amazingly crappy you'll be laughing from start to finish. (I won't even try to comment on the acting or all the other things)
