My kids watch the show every day. This is a great program for younger children. However, they have to stop playing again and do some more real performances and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Tired is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearl teeth and the kids notice these things and ask if the 2 never brush their teeth? Going to the show ever to the United States and, if so, where can we find its schedule. And another thing we might add. Tired you have to hide so many times. Sometimes when you get out of the nose where you scare the younger children and what is the rope of the rope? What does it mean? Others then get wet all the time. They should add the same ole to the newer stuff at their show instead of the same beer. Children lose such interest.
