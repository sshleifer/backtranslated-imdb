At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to record the offspring case. For a good reason! The super sleuth left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, no acute analysis of signs in crime scenes. Holmes bumps along fifty meters behind the plot. The deadly CAM is eventually applied by an old break in a way that would make Charles Bronson's heart swell in the bread tray with proud six bullets. In a subsequent race, a aftermath gets one of Watson's shoes. The author had a lot. It decides to attack the story of Cinderella to extend the film. The killer, Holmes and Watson, escaped gunfire. Oh yes, it's a bit of a change in pace in the late Victorian London. A bit of sixgun law :-)
