This film depends on self-confidence and confidence, and promises to develop into something that is used to it. But it doesn't. It's flat, self-conscious, unattractive and boring. <br /> <br /> A set of images and backgrounds doesn't make a movie, they make a calendar. This kind of bad socialist pseudo-drama documentary ("That's WHERE It Really Happened") not only fails to entertain, it fails to convince, so it doesn't even function as social history. Clich√©s associated with a bad play make it a very difficult movie to end, the entertainment factor is dropping pretty fast. The characters are one dimensional, which never develops to the extent they feel for them. The directors ego is the greatest character in this movie.
