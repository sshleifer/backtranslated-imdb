POPEYE AND LARGE **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; SIGNED OF POPEY'S GOAT ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I chased it as a kid, but I retreated an episode of the series of three cartoons that were already a few years later. theater screen of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they are not so good! The character of Popeye is not really sympathetic to start with, Olive Oyl is clearly offensive and Bluto's criminals also didn't get much interest? In short, the scripts were terribly thin, pretty awful and generally unsuitable to start. They're strictly youthful rates, but I doubt today that the kids even have the patience to stick with them! In addition, the animation style is unattractive. <br /> <br /> With each short in itself, I think they've improved one after the other: after the initial shock, one tailored to its mediocre quality as it was, so the third cartoon easily leads to the most enjoyable of fate? Popeye is entrusted to a mascot army, whose tremendous appetite does not end his calamity (almost original, I know, but always an amusing jersey). One interesting element here was that the shorts were placed with Popeye giving moralistic bits of wisdom to the children in the audience.
