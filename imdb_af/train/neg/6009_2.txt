What about Americans and hanging out with religious gobbledy-gook? To think it was a best-selling novel is incredible, but to subtract it as a movie, you really need good acting and a script that delivers. In this case all the good actors went to heaven and we left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type journalist (!). Try to discover why many people simply disappeared. Oh yes, there is a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine, or something. The good news is that it is done so cheaply and with such inevitable dialogue that it has a mere entertainment value in all its unintentional laughter. Not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit IQ.
