Born, educated and educated in Scotland, I was horrified by this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more or less than a cattle farmer. Worse still, the thread of the whole movie was sex in some form, by implication or verbal. To see this, one would think that the 18th century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sexual persons and homosexuals. Lange was a joke that was 49 years old as the "young" mother, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish loch is not one day as they portrayed him, but it gave them another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.
