The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with artists is so fashioned that I must assume that it was the desired intention. The sets are artificial and I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. The actors seem to just read their lines, rather than react to each other. While the film has elements of early film noir (except in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Given that the offer didn't appeal to me, I at least expected an engaging story. Usually I am fairly slow on the recording when it comes to stories with plots, but you can see what comes within the first fifteen minutes. By the time of the "Give, I forgot the $ 80,000," moment I thought to myself that this thing was really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with experienced gambling addiction to behave so foolishly, it is out of faith. If she were wearing a normal intelligent person at any stage, the whole story would have fallen apart. <br /> <br /> This wood production left me cold.
