I waited for the first show of this movie since it was released to me on DVD on Christmas. Last night I put a special lock on it, and I sat looking at it with my daughter (17 and a film student), of course, in chocolate with eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After just the first two minutes we knew we were sinking. The shaky camera shots and corners, general poor cinematography, direction and wood performance have already made us feel flat and dissatisfied. Dissatisfied, we looked. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strange and without any specific purpose, directly at the camera, broke our hard-won "fantasy of the moment" we are directly into an "almost find" your stalking fashion. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the writing and direction, blessing him. I hope they paid him well, as he drowned virtually on one occasion through a huge wave that had been a predictable breach of the sea world and had watered him and his fellow actor. They were almost thrown out of the sea. Health and Safety had a field day! Poor Rupert made his sea water spit to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money in the kitty to get a reshuffle from this scene. Anyone with any sense would not have tried it in the first place on such a day. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige, delivered the only convincing performance as Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon offset by Anthony Head's unconvincing portrayal of Annoying Sir Walter Elliott. <br /> <br /> By the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth made strange grace every two seconds for her for most of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment that made him forget his reason for the fact. In contrast, Anne ran, sent from the pillar to the post, looking for the good Captain who in the meantime could almost turn on the whole bath, in the course of only three or four minutes, without having to sweat. <br /> <br /> We didn't experience any of Anne's charms that crossed the screen. Indeed, we have left to wonder what Charismatic Captain Wentworth has ever seen in ordinary, spineless, friendly Anne and why someone, someone, didn't say, and wing Sir Walter to just close the shit. <br /> <br /> The important coast, usually our favorite girl moment, is painfully pulled out. As they approached, Anne opened her mouth and closed what had the effect on the screen to make her look like she was gum before the lips finally met. EWW! <br /> <br /> Last night's most enjoyable thing was the chocolate and the half-hour exchange of views between mother and daughter about how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> Sorry to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of England's best scenery. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
