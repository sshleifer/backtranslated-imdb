This film was done in very bad taste. The writing was really bad. I really feel sad for late Gregory Peck, who adopted the title role of this B-movie adaptation of one of the greatest generals of history. The film was politically wrong and straightforwardly insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene I almost threw up. It showed Macarthur in a bunker in Corregidor Island who spoke to the troops like a seasoned politician. a wounded, one-legged Filipino soldier. The soldier who is bleeding and dying can stand up straight to see the general and say, "No dad, no mom, no uncle sam" and Macarthur gives his little talk that Americans will never leave the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier being raised by Macarthur's words and giving him a clever salute. I mean, if there was a more condescending scene depicting the US as the great white savior of the world, please tell me because this one takes the cake. It has shown that Philippines is in distress ladies who are not honorable and rely on the great Americans for salvation. It blatantly and deliberately overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE (United States of the Far East). These are Filipino volunteers integrated into the US Army during World War II. They died next to each other with the Americans who defended the Japanese, who ran alongside the Americans in Bataan's death sentence and defended Corregidor Island by launching a guerrilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous' I Will Return 'speech. My grandfather, a Philippine world war 2 veteran and VSFFE soldier was one of many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the country of origin. I think this movie doesn't honor them and the thousands of other Macarthur relatives for intelligence preparations for his well-known return to the Leyte gorge.
