The first half was OK, but the last half was really disappointed. It's funny, the producers even admit they didn't have an idea for the end, and it really showed. What is really sad, I have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post it. I really didn't want spoilers to qualify for my comment, as the show isn't really worth it. When Battlestar Galatica first came out, I was very excited with the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen that the first season was the limit to be space porn. They eventually cleaned it a little and actually had some pretty drama, so I started looking again. But to end the series with kara who was a cyclone goddess, was the same with baltar and six properly stupid.
