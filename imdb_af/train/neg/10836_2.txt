"Magnolia" is a turbulent, confusing play that adds up to very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera sneaks through passages and passages, with a smile of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The general theme seems to be people who scream a lot, who cannot care for others (except John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who fall or die. I reminded how much I didn't like "Shine" due to the irreparable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unattractive characters here, why would we spend time with them? <br /> <br /> There is nothing left behind about "Magnolia." Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed on his canvas. There are especially two ideas that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. One has the camera from one character to another, while each one of Aimee Mann's coffee house folks sing. Sweet, but ineffective as we can't see what they are all doing together. The other idea I'm referring to can't be made different than saying it's totally unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has very good acting. Especially Tom Cruise who unleashed a show, I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly may be the most decent and really good policeman in recent memory. But it adds everything to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theater could no longer hold it and said, "This is stupid!" My feeling is that the majority of filmmakers will agree.
