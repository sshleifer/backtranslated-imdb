What the French Connection did so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this disaster, which is directed by Frankenheimer (which we also brought as good as Raindeer Games and the island Dr Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his particular obsession to capture Charnier (Rey). The fictional idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities is extremely funny. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't hit Charnier over town with 65 pounds of pure blow !!! A street value of 32 million, but yes, let's send Doyle to find this guy, that's his pinch. Please !!! The story was poor. The acting was terrible (with the one-off exception of Hackman, who totally survived his part). The direction was across the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and look at the first installment twice and save it.
