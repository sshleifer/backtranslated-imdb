... and I saw bad people. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. The play is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah does an OK job but can't save anything near this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in this movie is that the plot is so weak - although based on a good point of departure - that the author is dedicated to the "stupid heroine trick" to create a confronted tension . When all Daryl Hannah had to do was gone, she stood out in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without too much of what goes for a plot, I think it will be difficult for a bloody friendly woman to carry a pregnant woman out of hospital. Lamb. Very lamb. <br /> <br /> Save yourself a while and choose another movie.
