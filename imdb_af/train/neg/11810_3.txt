I noted with some entertainment that in the end credits, the Detroit PD was thanked for their participation. The head of police even has one talking line that plays himself (and boy, can you say he can't act). The reason for the entertainment is that the police first shoot in this movie and later ask questions. Not the kind of PR, I would think a police force would want. Other than that, it is your standard policeman and robber movie dressed for the 70's with a racial shop. Alex Rocco is given an ungrateful role of a lifelong policeman who cannot come forward and be satisfied with a mentally ill woman. He makes it up by hanging at the local whorehouse. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner who has a solid wardrobe and likes to pursue behind suspects while wearing a trench. The movie joins the penultimate shooting that makes no sense at all (why do people just guilty of a robbery adopt a whole police force?). Not only do we see one shooting, but since there are four bad guys, we see four. Then there is a turning end that is supposed to make one guess what would really have happened, but just made me think how stupid it was. Since that director Arthur Marks was also behind the friday "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I didn't have to wonder.
