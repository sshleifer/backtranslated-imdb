Probably New Zealand's biggest movie ever made <br /> <br /> The jokes They're not funny. Use of other movies and just plain corny. The play is bad, although there is a good role. <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting and boring. More cheese than pizza huts. Cheese lovers. Pizza kind of scene. 1000 times <br /> <br /> I watched it when it came on TV, but it was so boring it could be just 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Don't see it <br /> <br /> See paint dry earlier
