Wonderful throws wasted on worthless writing. Ten or so adults reunited at the summer camp, they attended as youths. Can it ever happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy and a boring one. Will they be teenagers again? Do they do their pranks, games, good times again? They may try, but eventually the answer is: No. Is there any plot? Any tension? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How anyone can be entertained by this drift is beyond me. I wanted to keep this movie; I tried to keep this movie, but my brain refused.
