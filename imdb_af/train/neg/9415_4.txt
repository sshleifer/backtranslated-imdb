Heavily re-ordered and often confusing, the original screen version of Man On Fire was at least ten years old when it was made and the passing years didn't make it any better. This is the kind of movie that makes producers with too much money and too little experience to get attention and do everyone else just to pay off their outstanding maintenance or their drug dealer. Scott Glenn's bodyguard goes out on a limb around his 12-year-old kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An Interesting Movie - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - did everything better, the action is slow and sparse and only makes John Scott's extraordinary score (part of Die Hard's last line emerged) a positive impression. One case where the remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of director for this version) is an improvement.
