I'll say the movie at least makes sense, but it's bad. The acting for the most part is not good (I think Sky has shown no promise) and you feel uncomfortable seeing it. All the scenes that need to be meaningful are very level, as if Ng came to her parents. There are many wheat-like details, such as the Kanji tattoo on the shoulder of the Sky, the magnets on the girls' fridge and the god, a horrible decor at the sets ... and the music ... and the clothes. And everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point: "I'm gay, not skinny." And not aware. Even the comments are terrible, I turned it off after Ng talked about how she was playing a lesbian.
