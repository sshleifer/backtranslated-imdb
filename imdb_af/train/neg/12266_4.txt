Republic photos come late in the game after the "Werewolf" Werecat genre. The plot has a writer who returned to Paris after a long journey abroad, during which he developed the jungle of the jungle. He comes to great praise as his novel, parallel to a notorious trial, is a best seller. The French government wants to know if it has access to secret documents, something that is likely to be murdered by a "catman". Suspect really falls to the writer when his fiancee dies. Complicating issues are the return of the blackouts so that the author does not know whether he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> Okay thriller is too quiet to fully enjoy. There is too much music in time and too much dead time when everything in the middle and later sections is discussed. The acting is good and the sets are pretty good, but there's a reason why most people I know just remember the top-dressed killer, he's the most interesting thing in this movie. Despite its short time (just over an hour), I think the reason this movie is rarely seen on TV is that you lose patience with it after 20 minutes. As good as the conversation, I just wish someone would do something. When it finally happened, it was too late at the closing time. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
