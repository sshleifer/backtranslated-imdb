SAPD AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> Suffering of 'hornophobia', Ollie starts on a 'quiet' boat trip, but he and Stan are mixed with an escaped conviction (Rychard Cramer). Chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - an OK tournament yet unraveling like a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodic in structure, the movie ends with an unforgettable voyage after the boys hostage of Crawley (who has a seagull to prove how difficult he is!). The gags are good but lacking inspiration, perhaps due to the recruitment of actress director Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for Ollie's first solo effort in the audio era (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here no measure of pzazz. Fair but nothing special. L & H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances.
