This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character killing himself - almost literally -. The only surprise in this movie is that you didn't have enough clues or character to be surprised. It was just a grim, sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this movie just sucked. Slowly, the movie didn't get bad, it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail is not coherently combined in a meaningful way, except to highlight a few gores that are eventually illustrated at the end of various perspectives. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment it slept me. (In general, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - it was even more disappointing.) <br /> <br /> I usually like negative comments or reviews about others' works, even when they suck but this movie justifies one. It's just bad that these great actors have been ashamed of this end result.
