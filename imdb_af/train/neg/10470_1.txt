What else to say? <br /> <br /> I've read all the reviews here and most are upright. . But one person has even gone so far as to call this movie angry and that Satan has polluted it (or something along those lines). Angry ?! Wow, what a shocker. . I mean, TBN basically made this movie. Please open your eyes. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has taken years. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Omega code is how much money they have spent making it. If this movie can be made, there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to be ready for "Yentl 2", and "Ernest loses the Omega Codes." <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in the biblical stories, the new movie Dogma will pick up where Omega code never started.
