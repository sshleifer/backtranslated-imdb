Having seen and loved Postal, I decided to try another yours Boll movie and I took Seed out because I stumbled into a local DVD store. This is one of his better films. <br /> <br /> While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film was very promising and looked like a non-mainstream psychological thriller, it fell off quickly and eventually into one of the most generic slasher movies I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional reactions and sub-mating. Boll seems to have tried his best to set up a decent plot, but it just surrendered after a while. Maybe he should like comedy? The few good things about this movie are that it manages to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack goes well with the overall atmosphere, but combining the unbalanced pace of this movie with its total generic nature, it makes it quite boring for the last half hour, which completely ruined my experience. There are a lot of pretty well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And we don't forget the camera work that was sometimes quite misleading. <br /> <br /> I hope Your Boll will someday learn what makes a good movie, because between many horrible movies it seems like a decent movie now and then. Seed just isn't one of those.
