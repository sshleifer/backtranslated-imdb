I saw it two days before the official opening, and I have to say I was very disappointed. And I have to make the most of these issues on the decision to cast Claire Danes into the lead. Depending on what you think of Danes, she was either terribly displeased, or so far in her head that she would be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for the worst actress. I think we're supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead, she is completely unstoppable. The other "big" actresses do an OK job, but don't make the screen. From all the "big" actresses in this movie, I want to say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Stripe is scarce in the picture, and appears just near the end. <br /> <br /> Horrible screenplay as well. It comes from more than they read lines as truly "in character."
