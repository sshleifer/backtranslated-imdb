Okay, it's stupid, they say they don't make another Nightmare movie, it's the "last" one ... And what do they do? They continue to make another one, not that the next one was (part 7) BAD, but why do they play us. Anyway, this movie didn't know what-so ever, it was extremly dull, the characters were highly one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker, who was very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and it's even worse than parts 2 and 5. I didn't get the movie, it's a stupid story in 3-d, meaningless! Id say. I hated this movie so much I still liked all the parts I didn't like that were basically the whole movie. It's so different from the prequels, trying it out and trying, but this one tried the hardest, and clapped it again on the face. There were deadly deaths, although they were different, they sucked bigtime. How could they go that far? Didn't they see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? Yet do they make it? That's all the money, DO NOT see this SAD EXCUSE for a NIGHTMARE series. <br /> <br /> I gave a nightmare on ELM street SES (6) 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE: Has potential with plot. <br /> <br /> BATH POINTS OF FILM: Terribly observing / lack of death / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
