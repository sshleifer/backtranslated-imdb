About 15 minutes into, my wife wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but its lack. They decided to fill in the spaces where the funny things had to be with so much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. If that were to happen (very scarce), we would sit back and watch (not laugh, think of you) and wait for the next eradicating or offensive comment (s). After about 35 minutes we both got up and left. Everything we read said how good it was. The trailer looks good and Roger Ebert actually calls it "intelligent" and said it was not a rough sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Cool, this is the only other movie I've ever run ... and I have no regrets. I'm sick of trying to see comedies in America.
