Yes, MTV is really a way to market Daria. What started out as a clever teenage anxiety - "commenting on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better about their sucky teen life" sitcom now mutated in a "how to deal with your problems" -charade. I have watched and loved Daria all the time. Now I'm sitting here in the so-called "movie". I can only wonder what the point of all this was. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Excuse me? doesn't the point Daria made every episode, what you like doing, is good as long as it's good with yourself, no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it? This whole thing reminded me of the scene in "Reality Bites", the movie channel showing the documentation for the first time.
