Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women." It is an annoying episodic script with three story lines laughed together, laughing badly for predictable writing, horrible acting, and even bad music. I found the anorexic main character upset to see how she was on the screen every time. She needs the fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes you want to dedicate to this turkey, something exciting, like pruning your teeth. You have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing about this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired writing. It's as impotent as the older man she puts into the movie. <br /> <br /> VIEWER SAFE!
