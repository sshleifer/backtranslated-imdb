I don't understand how these animated movies come out, and how good or bad it is, people love it. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I was looking forward to the movie with its excellent role. To tell the truth, I was bored bored. It was incredibly predictable and simply unsuitable. There were a few chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course, they tried repeatedly to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always tells me he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter got halfway confused. The children also thought the character animation looked strange. I didn't hear from them, since I saw The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type who's looking for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw there, it has very little.
