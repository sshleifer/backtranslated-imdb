Unfortunately, the movie is more concerned about making the social commentary on a real event, but does not have the balls to legally document what has happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I get the impression that Ben Coccio is a zealous gamer), or how media and music are completely unaffected, is the obvious message (we even get a ridiculous scene of the two boys burning all their CDs, talking about subtlety!), but the movie just gets away with it because it is "fiction". Good try. Yes, it is a good idea to lighten media of influence, but how do we know the children who have actually planned and executed a school shot? or video games? We're not, and we're not going with this movie, because these kids are once again smart enough to completely discard the media, but stupid enough to scorch a Nazi symbol on the ground? haha i don't think so. <br /> <br /> The movie bumps you over the head with the portrayal of the normality of families. It's almost thinking there wasn't a serious mistake in the family. dynamic of children who actually went out and shot their fellow colleagues. Why are everyone so worried that killers are "normal" when they are so clear? A totally false and insignificant depiction.
