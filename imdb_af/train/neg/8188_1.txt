The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is the fact that if someone becomes a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her other important ones will live forever. Let us forget that to be a saint is to be holy death, and saints do not have significant others. That, for a millennium, Nick is the Jolly Elf until Fred's Scrooge is never even seen! Open on Nick learns how to make toys, then learn on Fred how to run numbers; Nick gives a sick child a dolly, Fred takes the dolly back with the family farm! After a few more such episodes, Morph today excluded Fred from playing Siblings Anonymous, and his co-losers nod in empathy. There I just wrote a more coherent storyline than this idiot! <br /> <br /> This Santa, who is a "ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic west the Queen of the Harps, an operation straight from the Mega-Mall Hell, and answers to a Council (who?) Who just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg. Oh, and his right hand is a mere blonde in a very mini-dress and socks. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me over the edge was Slam as the # 1 on the naughty list. Don't reserve a naughty list for the future for Hitlers and Stalins? Children who are the true portrayals of evil? Nope, Old Wrap Fingers, a good boy who wipes out because he is unwanted and unattached, is the Demon Seed! <br /> <br /> The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be cooked in their own pudding! Bah!
