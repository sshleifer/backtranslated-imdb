This whistling movie looks more like a combination of MTV music clips than a real movie. There is no real story and if the movie goes on, ask yourself, "What is going to happen?"; but nothing happens. The story about Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other people seem to have nothing in common: why bring them together in a movie. With music you can see the worst movie. When I open the tap and there comes water with Bach's music, most people will love to watch, but it's not a movie. The director must learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting a movie.
