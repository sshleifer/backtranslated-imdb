I was previously unaware that Devry University in the early 1990s (or was it ITT Tech?) Contributed to his wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well, this movie had to be the product of the class valedictorian. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the side of the DVD. Don't waste your time with this movie. Terribly awful. <br /> <br /> The movie maker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman had dreams about the Boogeyman and his victim of the first film. More than 50% of this movie is stock from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character with the bad dreams while her therapist makes drones on a narrator. These scenes are shot by a filter, so the characters glow. They will make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So, to remember, terrible. Don't see this movie.
