This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies EVER, I emphasize, ever made. What's worse, my old hero Dolph is in it and he stares at it. Jesus ... The story is pretty good, but the way it was done even hurt my body. The fighters for starters are also choreographed as a battle between two drunks protruding into the gutter. The actors, except for Dolph, who also suck, do so badly that you can't help but wonder if their reason is that they are all the friends of the director who should be absent most, if not all the time . This is spent ยง12 million in an unimaginable way, because the lookout of the scenery and scenery cannot be a cent over ยง1000.
