ok. For starters, taxi driver is wonderful. That is not taxi driver or wonderful. What it is is bad. but I thought it was worse funny, which means it has some detached features. like the dialogue ... wow. There was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy. There were a few places where I thought the movie would fall into the taxi driver's kind of violence, which would make the message at the end of the movie much harder. I can't even believe that there are 20 people who saw this movie. Yes, it's worth checking out if you're really bored and you want to confirm that someone can make or at least try a movie.
