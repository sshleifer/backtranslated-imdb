The Herd is not really a movie. It's a wannabe movie, with wannabe actors. Not including Richard Gere, he did an excellent performance, but if only one of the actors really gives himself to his character and just plays the rest of the role ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are acting. What did Claire Dains do in this one? She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film she looked extremely out of place, out of everything !! The only thing she did was ask questions, like "do you really think so?", And make stupid faces. I was ashamed of her actions, seriously, and I was like her. She's the romantic movie, I don't know who chose her among all the actresses out there .... LOL, and see Avril Lavigne? it really made me laugh. Anyway. If you want the feeling of excitement, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote.
