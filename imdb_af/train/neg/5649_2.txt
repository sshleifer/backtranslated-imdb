I don't think it's too bad of a show under the right circumstances. I have patience the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who aren't really lawyers. God forbid anyone actually going to the law school, based on these shows, which I heard was the case when I watched a few interviews of the show. It just made me a little. <br /> <br /> It's the most annoying thing about Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show. Although it may be a compliment in some cases, it is certainly not here. They constantly harassed the women on the show. It's initially funny. But since it's all the time literally, I realized that it's as deep as the show will get. To try and suppress some serious, dramatic and even tearing moments in the midst of this mockery of a real show, fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest I have experienced in enjoying the show. <br /> <br /> Impressing Alan Shore's flamboyant and free "public service announcements" where he spits his opinions. Denny Crane is just irritating. I was embarrassed for him and for the show's authors for Crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit. <br /> <br /> I give two stars because there are moments where I thought the show's efforts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care. <br /> <br /> I think the authors of the show became aware that the sexual harassment shown by Denny and Alan even offended those who were more of them from the beginning. The thing is, I don't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well, but I just felt the author insulted me with the artificial implantation of sexual banners over the show in the hope that my libido would keep me back for more. I'm no longer a teenager, and I think this performance is promising if the goal is not to get the lowest common denominator to get ratings. <br /> <br /> Of course I write this after I realize that it won't really get much better than that. This is a pity because it is one of those shows that I love to love.
