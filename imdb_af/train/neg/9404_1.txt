This absolute trash is so meticulously based on the Friday 13th series, which is almost a carbon copy, assuming it is an Australian movie with non-performing people. <br /> <br /> Once a young boy accidentally burned out while filming a music video at the Eildon Lake. Now, a few years later, the boy is all big and revenge on anyone coming to the lake to film a music video. It's cliche-driven and a waste of time and money, just watch it out of curiosity, or if you are trying an aspiring actor to learn how to not (not) act. Lead role Alan Dale was in the television soap operation in the stars, but ended up in The X Files - how did it happen?
