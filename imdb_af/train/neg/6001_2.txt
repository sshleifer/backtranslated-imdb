It may even be crazy for the people who remember this show ... But I remember it as a live action. I don't think I've ever seen the cartoon. but movie? can be. I remember this very clearly. The man was in a building type like a showroom. He even had the red jacket. It was dark and he became a red car and there was the man on the second level looking at him. The car / man turned and crashed through the large showroom-type window and onto the street. And then continue to drive away. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else out there remembers that too. If not, maybe I'm still mad. But I hope I'm not.
