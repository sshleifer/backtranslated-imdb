A wonderful book about foxes and his family doing what dragons do. It is to steal farms and kill prey. until a thirty farmers decide that they have enough of this fox and try to solve the problem in different ways. They are, of course, "dropped out" each time and while the trio is being camped out at the fox hole, the family attacks the three farmers' land. <br /> <br /> The "movie" version, and I use the term movie loosely, is more of a god horrible pastiche of American heist movies especially the Oceans movies. They even added George clooney as Mr Fox to add to the insult and managed to miss the point of the story altogether. So kudos to them. They will earn a lot of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children's book.
