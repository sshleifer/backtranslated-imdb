Well, I don't think the picture is that bad, as most reviews make it up. . . but there is no denial that it has problems. <br /> <br /> Usually the issues are in the writing. There is a plot - but not much story, and certainly not one that anyone could possibly call acceptable; It performs any number of self-conscious foreign and / or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, what-what-you and ultimately it just didn't add in this department anymore. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can't care less about what "social sick" Farnsworth might be trying to address; There will always be a sector of the population who is willing to do just anything to tear their brains, although it is necessary to try and try out wheat fields to steal ammonia, or whatever it does. So, as a movie, you won't find me calling "Iowa", "important". But on a stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting and a few of Farnsworth's choices to portray a head-to-head outline are beautiful, hilarious, disturbing and - yes, I'm going to say - inspired. /> <br /> The play is uneven, but it can only be an accident of the prosperous stylistic reach. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress - but she's not very good here, so a discriminating audience should ask, "What happened?" It's strange that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few other actors can get around. For example, I can seriously consider what Farnsworth can provide for Michael T. Weiss's over-the-top as a probation officer, but I doubt I would ever buy it; It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Then again, it's the liveliest and the moment I saw John Savage in years. So go figure. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of job that tantalizes but doesn't promise - and that's good; Farnsworth or anyone else is not required to make films. So, whether Farnsworth has another movie in him or not, he will still be seen, but if he does, it seems likely that it won't be dull. In an era in which people plan their lives around the latest installment of "American Idol", we may allow Farnsworth's rightful and unmistakable film. <br /> <br /> What's more, perhaps we can be welcome, not counsel, his energetic and sometimes blessed idiosyncratic imagination.
