The movie is a bit boring. It is mostly a silent movie, with the bulk of the story being provided by a series of voice recordings. While a silent movie like this is being made, it's not such a bad idea, it's one of those movies where the lack of dialogue and the repetitive early scenes simply make it boring. You don't understand the reason for the tedium until it's good in the picture, and then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn, and incredible soft porn. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes starts meaningfully, but it is too late, because then the audience is lost. There are some good location shots at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wondered why more movies aren't being shot there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that give the campus a very different worldly feel. My biggest problem with the movie is that the director / writer made the movie as he wanted to see it without considering how a viewer who doesn't know the story will see it. You can't ignore the audience if you tell a story.
