What was it like. Someone read Stephen King and Sartre of course in the same semester. We get existential anxiety mixed with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each was canceled by terrible music, CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange stories like this is that it feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work sometimes feels, and like his interesting performances and movies, it goes far too long. Unfortunately, it's only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The role play was appealing, and it's about the limit for that. I suppose it touches feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have, but just don't make the characters happy enough to care for their fate ... whatever they were. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
