I went for this movie that believes it has good ratings. First, it is ridiculous that they released a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001, the film looks like it's been made on a shoe liner. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to determine how low a budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue to the end. If the movie had bright sparks, I missed it while I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a devil. She wears poorly tailored clothes and hoe at random children. As for Alec Baldwin, a scene he meets Webster for the first time, he should not be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins did, "Go back home and write better!"
