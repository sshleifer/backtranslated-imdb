My nose is slightly bent as I write it. I sent a previous comment this week about this movie, which has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it followed all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first time. Thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who appeared in such big productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo." Leonor Watling is also very good. Unfortunately, everything finally ends up under the weight of a truly horrible melodramatic writing. There is also an abundance of priceless nudity that does nothing to promote the story or even present impressive nuances that are otherwise a beautifully filmed artwork. <br /> <br /> An actual day trip to the beach in Valencia would be much less difficult than experiencing these fictional characters anywhere, anytime.
