Even if this film was a joke in response to critics, it's still a horrible movie. If you want to commit such a thing, at least it's a good joke. ..... First, Jeroen Krabbe, I think, poor man's Gerard Depardieu. Of course I hate Gerard Depardieu, even though he was very funny in the 'Iron Mask' three musketeer one. Otherwise he is a box office and Jeroen Krabbe is worse than that. The poor man's box office poisoning .... really, it's not fair for the economically displaced. If the "4 Man" is supposed to be a kind of criticism of the bourgeoisie ... what do I say? it is not. Let's say hypothetically, if it was supposed to be, it wasn't sharp enough. Satire is a difficult thing. If it's not sharp enough, the viewer gets the kick of the joke. I think that's what happened. The story ends just like a bunch of unfortunate disgusting characters who do nothing that anyone will give and also not in an interesting way ..... (For a more interesting and valuable application, see a Luis Bunuel movie ... very sharp satire) <br /> <br /> [potential spoiler warning] <br /> <br /> The work in the cemetery really does Jeroen Krabbe's character work so hard to achieve. is it funny? as Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good filmmaker, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was a misleading joke that was out of control. Although I guess he didn't throw Jeroen Krabb√©. because he is the worst actor and every character he played was a pretentious bourgeois ass .... except he is incompetent. So it becomes like a strange caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven has done this deliberately? And Jeroen Krabbe is also joking? I just don't see it ... So you understand the dilemma I'm confronted with here? This is the worst movie ever because he is supposed to be a good director. So there is a kind of duperie involved. I knew "Patch Adams" was terrible without even seeing it. Don't be dubbed by "The 4 Man's Fraudulent Package" Farmers' reputation as a good director etc. Etc.
