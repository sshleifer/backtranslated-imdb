This movie is just bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Now that I've got it out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from start to finish. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is worst on his cartoon character. Thanks, they killed him. And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameos? <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie is the little background we've given to Freddy. We see that he once had a family, and we see his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Other than that, everything is bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just as bad. The hour and a half I spent watching this movie and I and I and I can never come back.
