I bought this adaptation because I loved the novel by Anne BrontÃ« when I read it for some time and usually enjoyed BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me like the novel. <br /> <br /> First, the music (and songs) look completely out of place in a dramatic drama (sounds like it was written for a contemporary horror movie) and like another commentator, I was particularly bad about how the cameras played and worked. I saw some scenes filmed in North and South and it all looked, but in The Tenant it is definitely exaggerated and just annoying. Camera movements cannot make woodworking alive. <br /> <br /> Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish first and the writing lacked clarity. None of the characters were initially properly introduced. The boy has produced a very good performance, he is very cute and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterization of Helen Graham made her look cold and hard, leaving no emotion. She doesn't cry in a realistic way at all. I couldn't believe Markham could have fallen for her and I didn't mention the horrible hairstyle she was given. I couldn't feel sympathetic to her husband! Fancy married to such a virago ... Besides, he was the only lead actor who sounded right. Toby Stephens I just found Helen Graham's brother not very good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such dark topics as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, only in the TV adaptation is the reader's imagination heard in the book. The play is both brutal and comical, such as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed, and others have slaughtered too much for a period of drama! I mean, don't we get enough of the bed tones in contemporary dramas?
