This movie on paper looks as though it might be good after I watched even though I realized this movie was horrible !! The plot has no meaning, and I think I've chosen the best part of 5000 tracks, each one that makes the movie more boring and ridiculous. I watched this late night, nothing more than a noise, but just to add the SCARINESS of it, but the truth is the only thing that scared me, the music, which would call them tragic music, they play opera, I mean serious! This movie summarizes what is not good with this type of movie. To be honest, ill say no more, but look at your own risk, this movie is just rubbish, anything!
