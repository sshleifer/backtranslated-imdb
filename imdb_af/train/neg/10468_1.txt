I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. It was a really horrible movie. The script, directing and acting were equally bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made a clever and thought-provoking film, but he didn't do it. I sat in the chair for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus on the movie? Where was anything in this movie? Christians should boycott this movie instead of promoting it. It was done sharply and a waste of my money. Don't see this movie.
