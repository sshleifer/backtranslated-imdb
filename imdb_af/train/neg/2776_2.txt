The King Maker is a film about a series of real (reference) events that took place during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and artistry are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. The acting in particular was extremely poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let go of tears, and the accents, both real and false, are extremely annoying. The storyline was too stupid and too stupid to be true and it was more like a history lesson. The movie couldn't even capture that kind of regale and age-old air, and it looked more like a failed attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Final say? Costumes and art give the film a fresh fresh air, but the performance was extremely poor and the actors could not even give natural outbursts of emotion. In short, the movie sounds more like a slide than a script.
