How the mighty case happened to me. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she was definitely slumbering when she took this role. This movie is bad for one reason, especially: decay in logic. It looks like one of those movies that would have been fitting with all its plots if it came out in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it just looks dumb. It's the worst thriller I've ever seen, and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The story details Della (Kim Basinger) only gets from buying gifts in a shopping mall and is plagued by a gang of thugs who eventually kill a policeman who came to her aid. Since then, she has been hunted by an abandoned street through this idiotic goons and gets rid of one toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said, this movie is about every logical move and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the play for TV is bad. Hell, this pseudo-thriller is made for TV bad. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African-American who all come together to steal a Caucasian woman. Don't you just love America?) Is ridiculous for a error. The way she killed the Spanish man made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the headdress was so in the left field that it made you shy. I only recommend it to lovers of bad movies and no one else. Anyone else, especially Kim Basinger fans, will do well not to own this movie. You don't want to see an actress you respect in a movie, now it's bad? Of course not. You're warned.
