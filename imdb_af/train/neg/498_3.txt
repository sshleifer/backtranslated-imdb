I saw this movie when I was much younger and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week, and you can guess the result. Some funny parts in it, very little and too long. The start is the only thing funny when you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a total b-movie, it's a good choice, but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size.
