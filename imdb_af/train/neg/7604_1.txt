Certainly it does occur in the west, but the title seems to be a conventional western. Instead, it's a movie of a woman Sheriff. Don't make a mistake, though it is a bad movie about a woman's scarf. She becomes sheriff when her husband comes down; she was just a little upset about this. Her main purpose is to go to the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a man to kill her. So that's what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Quite stupid, as someone in this movie killed, the new sheriff resigned. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I think she likes him, she won't. The killer is also to the mayor of the town for personal reasons, which is also quite stupid. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching ... it's not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made. I can't imagine anyone seeing it without them, because it will make it much more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he needs to know better than to get people in one place and get out.
