I read comments on this being the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps as the only Chinese movies you have seen, no dialogue, long stretched distances and silence, and hack editing, you're on the point. <br /> <br /> Complex story line? Rare. Try youthful and amateur. Beautiful moods and ghostly memories? Rare. Try flat and sow. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Especially when the best rules in the movie are "How are you? I'm good. Are you sure? Yes." Wow! What depth of character. I think the persistent cigarette smoke was supposed to talk to them. <br /> <br /> As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies, I was totally disappointed. Even Zhang's sentimental juicy "The Road Home" was better than that.
