When I borrowed this movie from a friend (thank you, I didn't buy it) on the package (which looks really bad and ugly) the "Ultimate Vampire Trick" was printed. After watching it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The story begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old VHS system if not worse. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and just because the promo-T-shirts look cool. I don't want a movie student or flash movie in general, but I saw Braindead and I saw a 20-dollar budget film of students that was ten times better than this crap.
