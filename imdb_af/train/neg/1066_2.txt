I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it, so I went with him. Meanwhile, I was indifferent to the movie, but I really left the regret to waste 2 hours of my life by putting this low production. The "stories" are almost completely forgotten, except that most of them were terrible. What did Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors has certainly given this French film a remarkable non-French feel. The clichés about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them were playing with clichés about Paris, but by spending so much time enjoying French cliches, they promoted them directly and unfortunately. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We'll get it. <br /> <br /> The worst segments were: the one targeted by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the mime one (the worst?); the hair products one; The one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); The vampire one (If I think of Paris, I think of Elia Wood). The one with Natalie Portman, who really looks like a Mentos commercial and it was stupid (the blind young man needs to know Portman plays only a role when she called him). On and on it went. It feels infinite. <br /> <br /> I also didn't have the Coen Bros one. It really plays with those Parisien clichés, but I didn't find it funny. Not annoying. The Gus Van Sant-one was interesting, but it was so small (and the punchline was obvious) that it was barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were the one on immigrant childcare who left her baby at a nursery school just to babysit a baby for a rich woman. Nice irony there. And the segment about Africa being stabbed. This is the best segment in the whole movie, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment, one with the pretty middle-aged woman, was also interesting, but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate her limited grip on French, but the segment came down as falling away. <br /> <br /> The whole project forced and felt uninspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. With just about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a terrible movie experience.
