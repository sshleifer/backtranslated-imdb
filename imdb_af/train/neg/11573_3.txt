I came here last night for a review before deciding which TV movie was lying before, and those I found made this one seem unacceptable. How I Feel Feeling! <br /> <br /> First of all, it must be pointed out that it is a housewife's day film. The performances are wood, each sentence is an attempt to give an attempt to the way housewife's daytime movies and bad soaps are always, and is based on the predictable and well-deserved prospect that men (especially soldiers) are mainly violent and incompassionate. The whole movie is about the "drama" that occurs in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If it's acceptable to you (or even pleasant), be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, while reasonably good, is painfully distracting - like her face, for some reason. The other actions are undoubtedly a lasting source of embarrassment for their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characteristics. There are few surprises, but look for the 'Monty Pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' backpacks! <br /> <br /> I didn't expect action, but I was hoping beautiful or textured or emotionally loaded. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas feel-good story that would have an intelligent audience emphasizing the crapulence of everything. <br /> <br /> Look under the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You're a fan of predictable 'housewife take on men and win' TV movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood makes it into a feature film. 4: You have had enough feeling that your emotions are easily affected by unsophisticated storytelling.
