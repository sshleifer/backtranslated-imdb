In my Lit. class we have just completed the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mother cheated on his father in a station wagon in the forest where no one could see. (4) The man who deceives the mother does not have black hair, he has blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can't hit his fist through a window in one punch. <br /> <br /> And for the play, the child Brian played was a horrible actor. <br /> <br /> I believe, though, that the scenery was impressive, although I doubt the director even reads the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you haven't read the Hatchet book. , by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, start a complaint letter to the director.
