If you want to see a riddle, don't see it. Although there are elements straight out of the Elmore Leonard area, it comes closer to an episode of "Dynasty", as the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - ie long, boring conversations between stupid, non-involved characters. Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this one.
