I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was completely wrong. Many of the facts were wrong. The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the images ShiHuangDi guarded. I also thought the battle scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many actors and actresses weren't very good. Some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst possible rating it can get. Disney really needs more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was fairly accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste time.
