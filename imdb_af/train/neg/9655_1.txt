I finally watched this movie before I even went through one of the reviews, at the request of a female woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who recommend other people to watch this movie. I'm pretty shocked to find so long and positive reviews on this site that makes me think it's a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as I am concerned, I have to ask, "Are these movie makers delayed or do they assume the viewers are delayed?" The movie is feared on so many levels and I don't even talk about the story or listing. <br /> <br /> So, this group of guys plus one girl (the main actress) forms a band of music; Guess the constant presence of guitars, it's supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell, then dancers became part of a rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as the Bollywood version of a Rock band, but amusingly all the scores that actually had these two guitarists have done all kinds of cool "ROCK GESTURES" and I assume they were the instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely missing !!! I simply can't understand the scale of stupidity here. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to deduce here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further mistakes in the movie. Bollywood directors are no longer ashamed !!!!!!!!
