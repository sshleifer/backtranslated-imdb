This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I hired it as a joke and expected to get a giggle out of the first few scenes, and just let me say I never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene where ninjas come out of the air at random and start a big and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most amazing, deadly action moments of my life. It's not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and doesn't mean it) of the action genre. I didn't see the first two, but according to the complexity of the plot, I don't think there was too much I missed. If you want to watch a movie that costs well with a six-pack or a herbal remedy, as I insist, you hire this movie and sit back and watch a 100-year film roll in the trash and get it kermosours
