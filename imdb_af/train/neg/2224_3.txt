I only saw it when I was about seven. I remembered what I believed to be a vague overview of what had happened. It seems now 15 years later that I remember everything with great accuracy, as the authors seem to have gone beyond making an overview of the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no back story, no character bows, nothing. The good guys do things because they are good, while the bad guys just do things because they are bad. One inadvertently hilarious part is when someone you think would be important, die and nobody cares at all. They only look at their shoulders and continue. There is hardly any dialogue. Eliminating the battle scenes and running scenes will lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this because you want to see a good animation and for no other reason. Or if you want to look at rickety hot cartoon chicks (or scantily dressed warm cartoon puppets).
