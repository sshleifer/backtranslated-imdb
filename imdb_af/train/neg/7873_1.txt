This movie is so bad and gets worse in every way imaginable. It is not just the poor acting and the writing, nor is it the lame and perverted time to look at it. What really puts this movie into my scandal is the apparent struggle that the authors and producers are doing with the movie to make it funny. The actress who replaces Jean Reno's descendant is too old and taught her lesson in the first film so they can add a new girl who needs to be married. Almost all the original extras and gags return, however, this time I leave my eyes frowned upon because it is a waste of a good movie. Torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can place the viewer in violent revolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the body into the public square and perverts not only the original idea and its legacy, but also our intelligence. This movie, unlike the spruce goose, couldn't fly because it didn't have a "necklace". No writing since it appears to be written and added to the daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for it. This movie will not even pass a student video in the basic Film 101. How this stack comes through, no one can tell it. This was a huge loss of investment and it seems that no one has the power to put this unnatural cruel error out of our misery. This movie has one good part ... its END! This movie is my # 1 worst movie of all time, eventually "Howard The Duck" is no longer the goose.
