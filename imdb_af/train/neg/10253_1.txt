Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all his work. He is known to save movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This movie suffers from a low budget and the production values ​​are disturbing. Please ... for the love of Christopher .... avoid this movie!
