For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to see a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to become creative and made this 80-year-old video something of a sci-fi story involving the evil Barbarella villain, from which the band got its name. <br /> <br /> What this idea fails is that it takes place in the midst of the 80's Duran Duran songs, confusing and annoying cut sounds that the fiction antagonist tries to stop the band on one of their concerts . Not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer from a cheap spin-off story by an evil dr. Mario is housed. It's almost too much to carry. 10/02
