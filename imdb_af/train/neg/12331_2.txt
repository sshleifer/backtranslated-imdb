One of the "coming years" movies that nostalgia for adults and promises for kids. This movie doesn't. It is a bad excuse to have Sylvia Kristel's body eat twice with a brave Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is stupid or stupid when trying to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Low uncomfortable as we are supposed to believe that a teenager will go alone to bury a dead woman in his front yard. Think carefully why a woman known to Emmanuelle needs a body double. As the movie attacked, I started to propose a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Mrs Millions, which seduced Sylvia Kristel Jennifer Love Hewitt, as Howard Hesseman nostalgic for WCRP. Look at it to laugh at other people's stupidity, or for Ed Begley Jr's dedicated performance, or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel will look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from films staring at Sylvia Kristel, which is not Emmanuelle.
