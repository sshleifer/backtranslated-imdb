If you really have to watch this movie, because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be a boy. But prepare yourself by bringing your hk if it comes with a radio. <br /> <br /> After watching such a good movie like Arisan (2003), it's terrible to see what they are getting up in Indonesia again. It seems the only idea is to earn money, but nobody seems serious about working on the image of Indonesia in the entertainment world. The fact that it is a "global" world does not appear in the minds of those who make films in Indonesia. And as the Indonesian public swallows everything they offer as 'Made in Indonesia' with a scent of the west, they get away. <br /> <br /> OK, the story is nice to start with. And it could have developed into a nice movie. But did the director never think of the fact that a musician firstly needs live music or at least good play, and secondly good choreography? In this movie, the show is so BAD that it wants to make you cry in the theater. Every single word you hear is followed later by the actor or player who sings, and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as if they are planning to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end thought it would be nice to change it into a musical ... They just forgot to change choreography. It hardly dances, you jump here and there, throw their legs in the air and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, there is at least a happy ending. But if you can convince your girl that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, DO SO!
