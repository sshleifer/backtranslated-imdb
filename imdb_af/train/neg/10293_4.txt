My wife and I watch a movie without distraction every night, and mostly art films that were thought to be. I have a lot of patience for slow-flowing movies. My wife has twice the attention span I do. All that is said - this movie is just empty and borrowing! It didn't go anywhere. Never bled. It starts pretty well with a promising plot ... then its biscuits ... go to Spain .... she's struggling, she's staring .... the credits roll. Unequal, full of holes, false and dead. We only stared at some space through a couple of extended rows. Artificial depth was implied when she played and cried with the mud. Zzzz ...... It's like a pretty chick spot pretending to be deep or artificial. You will never understand or understand Morvern. About halfway through you just doesn't care. We just wanted to see that at least one of the plot lines evolved. Don't waste your time on this. I'm shocked that it's so high.
