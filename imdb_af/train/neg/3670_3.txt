For a science, movie to work well, it must be truly original or a very good re-enactment. This movie is not. Certainly there is a pseudo-original strife because the man kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but it is a very small dispute. There is government conspiracy angle, the crossroads protagonist who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And one real drawback of this movie is that the infected man has no pathos. Although the character is written to be someone who needs to be looted, he is not. Unfortunately, the movie is useless. The other characters are cookie cutters that they are ridiculous. The subplots are intricate and irritating. And the saddest thing is that the movie is too flat to enjoy even as a shocking material. Make the movie a short 45 minutes and it may be worth watching.
