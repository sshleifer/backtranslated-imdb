This movie was a stupid crap. Bad everything. Why is it that we who love western movies get nine out of ten when we hire westerners. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck on the cover, it's not worth it. In general, the main action of Shiloh Falls took place in 1892, but the revolvers were 1860s. Even the shooting was bad. In one scene, the gunshark caught his six shooters about nine times and couldn't hit one of three big men who were just about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this weakness. Perhaps those who participated in this movie took some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
