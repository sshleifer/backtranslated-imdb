Look, I read and read these comments and there are many things I want to say, but I'll try to clean it up briefly. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, we forget all the bad things about this movie ... How it showed nothing about Notorious and I agree with most people here and say it "Hollywood "was, I mean, what did you expect a true life story? When will people wake up and see that you will never find the true truth about 2pac and Biggie. It's all covered and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not against 2pac or not. Biggie I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID are surely embarrassed in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Next, for everyone who says the movie is wonderful and can't see the truth you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG or you know nothing about him and you love this Hollywood teen movie. Use your thoughts and see all the clouds ... There are many things you can say when it comes to this topic, I didn't say 60% of what I should say, because it is a very wide subject but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a bit, I mean much better done. But anyway, I'm just someone who gives her opinion. No hard feelings. <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip hop and I'm alive for it, but having seen this movie every person with a little intelligence can see that it's not how someone suspects to live. With everyone, respect for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists playing for such a life, has to change the other page because you destroy the app .... Bring the wrong message to the kids and that's: don't go to the school, but off the streets, wrestling and just grabbed the paper. <br /> <br /> True hip hop is supposed to be love and intelligence, be smart and everyone. <br /> <br /> OK I know many of you will think I'm crazy, but that's just my point of view. Look, I'm maybe wrong about something and I'm not saying it's a really bad movie, because even if I'm 17 and 18 in hip hop, I don't know anything about 2pac or Biggie, how many articles I read or how much I They support and listen to their music ... Like most of you all out there. Only people very close to them and the murderers know the truth behind it all. <br /> <br /> And for the end, I just want to say to all of your Biggie and Tupac fans and relatives, these two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but, PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO REIN BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE EVERYTHING, THANK YOU FOR OUR LOVE NOT LOVE. IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY OR FAME YOU CAN MAKE AND HOW SAFE YOU CAN COME ABOVE, TO COMPLETE YOURSELF TO THE FULL AND NUTRITION OF YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MINIMUM ... PLEASE IF YOU EXIST, YOU WILL LIVE A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH !!!! PEACE AND LOVE YES ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LIFE EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHER THAT CHANGES A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
