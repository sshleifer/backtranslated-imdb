Filmfour does much better than doing this little snot of a movie if they get the right kind of reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is in Glasgow (though only a few secondary characters have anything that draws a Scottish accent). The premise, about people whose lives go nowhere, who all meet in the same cafe in the early hours while having night work, can make a very funny, informative, peculiar, cultural film. Instead, we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot so far done. I'm surprised it's not banned. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, you find it out. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it looked like something a group of 16-year-olds would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely redundant - just written as a token woman in the hope that women would want to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of thick pool that laughs on beer advertisements and you can usually find around in packets screaming in undecided city centers on Saturday, then you will love this movie and it is a "real laffie" find. Anything else, run, don't stay away from this unfortunate little thing. <br /> <br /> And one question, when the group left the "boring" coastal town (Saltcoats happened by chance though they changed the name on the movie), to go back to Glasgow, WHY did they via the Forton highway services at LANCASTER done in England?
