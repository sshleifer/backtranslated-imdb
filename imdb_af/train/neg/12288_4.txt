Making the movie as dark and visually fuzzy as possible to cover the budget deficits is a frequently used strategy in low-budget horror movies, but this one takes it too far. It's so weak and dark (and it almost happens in the night, to start) that you often end up almost to a black screen (although the bad video transmission may have been). Unfortunately, "dark" is also the best word to describe the movie's plot. The filmmakers throw in divergent (and inexplicable) horror ideas without any logic, and halfway through you get the feeling that they have made the effort to make a good horror movie. you know this when you see characters supposed to be dead (or sometimes even dead)
