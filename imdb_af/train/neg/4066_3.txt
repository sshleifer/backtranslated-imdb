In director Eric Stanze's "ISOYC, IPOYG", three men are subjected to torture under the hands of a woman who has sexually abused them all. The first victim is forced to eat his own shit before being killed. The next block ends with a bullet in the cross after refusing to have anal sex with the first man's body. But it is the third man who gets the worst: he has to look at the heavily tattooed 'star'. Emily Haack gets naked and masturbates with a broom handle (oh, he also gets the handle, shook his buttocks too!). <Br /> <br /> And unfortunately we also (see her masturbate, it's not a bumblebee!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is a hard viewing experience, not because of its unrelenting violence, but because Haack, who is apparently under the wrong idea of ​​having the goddess body ( Unlike a roadie for Metallica, the camera is constantly getting naked. It's not pretty. <br /> <br /> In addition to the non-stop nudity of a shopped Haack, viewers also get terrible direction from Stanze (who thinks that endless shots of tombs and trees are an entertaining thing), a very bad play , and a thick man's penis. Oddly enough, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a score of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than the current 2.9 average. This is one point for the bad ax attack (which is a gore dog, I actually enjoy); a point for the little where the fat man has pushed his face into chocolate mousse that has been hilarious; and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this movie might somehow be a sequel to Meir Zarchi's superior exploitation classes that I spit on your grave.
