TV pilots, don't you like them? Quinn Martin tried to do this one after he was successful in many other TV detective movies, but this one goes nowhere except in the MST area where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes Tannie Mary's orders to find Super Spy Lovejoy, I mean tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. Boom sucks as a bad man despite all his disguises that make him look exactly the same as he normally does. There are more unnatural clothing fibers here than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970s) and the show itself is so anti-climate. Why didn't it go to the series? You find out, it's pretty blatant. Again, it's fun for MST, but not much else !!
