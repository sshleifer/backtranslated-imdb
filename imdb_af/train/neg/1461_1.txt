I saw that movie, and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The film lies, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the man with his gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he didn't want to hit people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. Understand ?? Another thing is: It is too obvious that Hitler is so angry, he was smarter than in this movie. No German would have accepted him as leader, because he could see that he was evil. Thus, the real Hitler did not show his evil side to the people. <br /> <br /> Did any of your Yankees look at the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? It's a great movie, with great actors. And this is a German movie. I think, this theme of Nazi Germany, should not be realized as a movie by people who know nothing of Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad time for people around the world.
