To go into this movie, you know that this movie has six laboratory technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So immediately you guess who will live and who will die. The survivors are exactly what you expected from them, so no points for plot turning there. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if it's a B-movie or a movie that just happens in a lab with an engaging story, William Devane plays a role: immediate B-movie status . <br /> <br /> The movie is promising in the beginning. At the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla which is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, praying. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same thing when their bacon makes invisible. <br /> <br /> There are some bare breasts, a lot of lame dirty joke and plenty of space to tear to give this movie an R-score that didn't really need it. . <br /> <br /> For a thrill, there were really no surprises except Shue made MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a "Whaaaa?" OK, there is a surprise. This is when Caine (Spek) returns to the elevator the last time. It was a surprise, just because you were screaming on TV, "Noooo! You are already dead! End the movie! "Talk about screaming on the TV, that's all I've done for the last 25 minutes or so. "Put your f # @% ing glasses!" Instead of turning on their infrared glasses so they can see him, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinklers ...). <br /> <br /> The story really lost it. But the special effects were good; That's the only reason I give it a 2/10.
