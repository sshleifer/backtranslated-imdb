Don't watch this movie if you loved the classes like TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOK, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYL, SONNY SHROYER and BEN JONES! THIS FILM WILL SAVE YOUR BATH YOUR BATH! First of all, this movie starts with Bo and Luke who run Moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke will never do the right thing! This movie shows unbelievable characters things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Oom Jesse was honest and legal. In this movie he is a criminal who smokes moonshine and smokes with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if it was an extension that adds to the Dukes or Hazzard Reunion! and the dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW SHOULD WE HAVE THE MOUNTAINS TO MOON WHEN HE DID IT BEFORE THE DUCKS OF HAZZARD IN MOVIE MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HIGHED WHEN HE DID IT IN 1997 FOR THE TRAVEL PHOTO! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? These characters seem to have returned to life when they died 11 and 8 years old? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they had to bring James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000. They made a family-friendly movie with the living original characters that made. the show it was and yet compared to this disgusting, shameful movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy the 2 set of Reunion, including Dukes or Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both stare at the original cast, and are family-friendly! Don't waste your time on a movie that is not the CD on which it was written!
