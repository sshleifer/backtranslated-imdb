This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling to gain recognition and personal glory is just to lose it because of bad dialogue, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, just to lose steam halfway to become one-dimensional people who were spitting one-liners tired. Perhaps if they spend more time on the story and dialogue, it would have been a good movie, rather than a near-miss attempt.
