One wonders why someone is trying to recover successful movie stands that have already been seen, as in the case of the movie. "The wedding date" is one of the best examples of why not even under the prospect of a new story trying to revive something. As a project like this continue with the approval of the studio's great baseball, then go out with big stars and shiny production values, so people will come for the stars. <br /> <br /> Oh, that's not what. happens in this deceived attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be how the authors transplanted the story to London, and it seems to be a typical American situation that won't even solve the institution. Then there's the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have so much chemistry like oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the beginning, the viewer is not drawn into the movie as the creators thought they would be. Obviously, Kat will fall for Nick, and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in Junebug, comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going and does not get clean with the man who loves and marries her. <br /> <br /> For anyone interested, the credits end up at the end of the movie for almost seven minutes!
