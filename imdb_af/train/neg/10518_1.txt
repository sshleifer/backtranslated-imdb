Oh boy, where am I going with this one? Herendous acting, poor plot, stupid deaths, useless nudity ... <br /> <br /> It's not fun ... it's hell. <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Don't waste your money, time or life on this pit of evil. <br /> <br /> It's just ... god damn is this movie awful! Tom Savini, WHY? Why would you waste your life on this shit? This movie is not worth it. I'd rather crack and break, hit my head against a wall than watch it ... this sinful act! <br /> <br /> Please take my advice and stay away from this elephant thorn of a movie. No, you know what? I don't even have to call this thing a movie! Just stay away!
