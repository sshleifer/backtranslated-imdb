Although it is an R-rated movie, I really doubt that you will really enjoy it unless you are a teenager. <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has enough is nudity. Tone and tone naked or almost naked chicks (nice licks I can add) to see your eyes. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand why this movie has the American Pie title because it's just a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see naked chicks, but you are too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> Give it 1/10 for the 2 smiles I had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks
