Lots of laughter - because it's so incredibly bad - sorry people, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I know it's a low budget, but anyway: the actors act like playing in a soap. The dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I saw such strange photos was a trash 10 years ago at a few celebrations. I really appreciate people coming together and shooting cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality must be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quiet, interesting and good - and the score was really worth listening to. The DVD cover has promised a lot, but it is by far the best that this movie offers ...
