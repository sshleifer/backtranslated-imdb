Well though. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 outing was in "Masters of Horror", it's the complete opposite. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with "Cigarette burns", but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I have ever seen of him. <br /> <br /> It's stupid, totally without ghostly atmosphere and excitement and it is rising, despite the less than an hour running. The writing is nonsense, the characters are irritable and unattractive, and the conclusion is rather absurd. <br /> <br /> And for the pistons who bought the DVD (one of them is me); Have you seen Carpenter describe the movie? He is really proud of it and he speaks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the writing. And in the commentary track, where he noticed an obvious screw that made it to the final cut, he just said he didn't feel the need to fix the mistake and he just let it go. I fear that the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I have been proven wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and mention that the creature effects are incredible. Technically speaking, this film is, in addition, with effective lighting schemes and makeup effects.
