As a slasher movie aficionado, I will usually settle for every slash movie that runs over my retinas, which is sometimes more damaging than good for my brain, I will say. As the canal followed the other night, Sleepaway Camp II crossed my roads. Of course I wanted to look it up, as I heard from the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I have never seen them (for shame I know it). I would note that, since I did not see the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong is completely deliberate by the own design of the franchise. <br /> <br /> Now I'm assuming that Sleepaway Camp's franchise itself is a joke. Hell, even the name comes down as a deliberate joke. Sleep away camp? It's fun. I can appreciate the movie because I just want to gather something for a pure mockery value, but it goes as far as I can go. The play in this movie excelled the original Friday the 13th, like a performance by Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen, as the malevolent murderer, had a better job of killing my interest than she did. As far as comedy is concerned, there were a few times I visited, but it was little and far between. <br /> <br /> Eventually, SAC II was pretty boring, and I really wanted to stay away from the camp. The deaths are so clearly staged and false that you can barely appreciate them. If you are looking for a movie comedy with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel is navigating you over this one, look and see what's still going on.
