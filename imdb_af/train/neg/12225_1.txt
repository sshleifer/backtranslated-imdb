My personal vision of hell is locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or close my ears and this movie plays forever on every available surface in that room. The whole idea that Streisand is just playing a boy / man starts scratching the surface of how ridiculous an assumption this movie is. The most important thing to watch any movie is the concept of a willing suspension of unbelief. . . it is impossible to do this in this movie.
