Was it a thrill, as I thought when I saw the cover at the video library? No. Was it a 'food fr thought' as the author might have tried to do it? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average movie that had great potential, and was well targeted, but came across with a confusing story without strong points, with the beginning of the middle and the end, expecting poor acting from the serial killer, though some points were superfluous. delivered the best performance of the favor overall. It was fun cinematography, with good colors, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenics, but let's get lost over where it went and where it was. And with a sense of let's pick it up fast. OK to see if there's anything else on TV.
