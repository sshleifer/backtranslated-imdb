One-note comedy that probably puts the modern feminists' teeth on the edge. Betsy Drake, the shop clerk, is in love with the idea of ​​babies and marriage, highlighting her hopes for female magazines until she spies a super-bait in the form of slender baby Cary Grant. The rest of the movie goes from one to the other, while the relentless Drake pursues her quarry. I think the word "perky", just about the sum of Drake's approach to the role. She did have a beautiful smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, I started to overdo it. Grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. However, there is one scene that almost saves this slender exercise. Drake inquired about the unsatisfactory award after his lecture to a spacious full of reverent ladies. Here, her beautiful way has an unusual freshness that is really remarkable, and if the production didn't smear in that healthy smile for 90 minutes, the movie might have been more than a girl's daydream, about 1948.
