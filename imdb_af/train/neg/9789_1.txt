They had to mention this film: "Approved Mouse Brother It was slightly inspired by someone's vague reminder of Stuart Little, who just pulled a little off the book, but mostly just remembered the cover." If it wasn't so misleading, I would give it a better review. <br /> <br /> But serious people, do your children a favor and let them read the book. They can actually learn something, rather than have their minds immersed by what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The book Stuart little is not about a mouse, it's about a person who is very small and mouse-like. He was born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from the house and the journey he started. There is a cat called Snowball who thinks he is food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can't speak. <br /> <br /> In the movie they screw it all up. I think the only thing they kept out of the book was the boat race and the names.
