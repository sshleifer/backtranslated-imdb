I can't stand most reality courts and this one is the worst one with Paris Hilton, and that's probably his company. But "you're fired" or "you're hired" for how many seasons now? After I watched the show, I didn't want to work for the guy with his ego and everyone, and I think it seems to be dry and has more fun. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear that only one person gets up and says, "Donald, I stop and take your money and buy a decent hairdresser." I see he even tries to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I no longer have to see his pathetic face. It must be sad to have so much fame and have no talent and make a hole of yourself to buy it. I will give this impression a negative if I can, but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve it.
