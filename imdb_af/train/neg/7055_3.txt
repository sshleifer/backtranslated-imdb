Let's start by saying "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said, "I missed the joyride". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just awful. Performances were average. Something went wrong with the movie. Emran deserves something better. All CELINA JAITLEY did, was exposed. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. Emran hashmi was also OK. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate man who wants to become famous. Therefore, he uses RADHA and states that he loves her, just because her father is a music director and can help him become famous (since then the father heard everything his daughter said). One day MANN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely for her look and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> That night, ROMA can't open the door to her room, and MANN decides to help her. As he can't, ROMA is going to ask for help. While away, MANN can open the door and decide to come in and put on her bed BLA BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes in and they have one night. But in that one night, ROMA fell in love with him. That morning they spot the underworld donor (MAHESH) who sees it all. The don loves ROMA and couldn't stand what he saw. He commands them to marry and becomes scared, MANN obeys the command and Merry's ROMA. Then their marriage news ends in the newspaper. MANN later finds out that he loves ROMA after compiling a music video together. He is now trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also wonderful. The title track is also fantastic. GUYS, DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE.
