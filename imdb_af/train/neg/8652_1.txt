I thought before I started with this movie, that it might be a good one, but when I started it, I really found it terrible. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film was shot in India. You can see Indian cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri (an Indian water brand), Hindi written on the go, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * it's really funny and lots more stuff that doesn't seem to have been shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his / her time watching this movie .. pure waste of time .. i would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or maybe being, heart is better idea, but don't waste this time
