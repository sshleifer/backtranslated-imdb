S.I.C.K. really stand for So Incredible Crappy I killed myself. There was absolutely no action to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the artwork on the box cover. The budget of this movie was sufficient. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie have been stolen from a clothing store. The end was so predictable that you should progress and laugh at the last 5 minutes. If there's a book for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I will avoid it at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes they appreciated the whole movie. I'm just kidding.
