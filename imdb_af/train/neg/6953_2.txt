Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As this mini-series approached, we've made it well-known over the past six months, as Sci-Fi Channel continued their programs with BG ads, I confess I felt an increasing discomfort while learning more. <br /> <br /> As with any artwork that has led to a certain time, different people go to see different things. In this regard, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some it is the warriors with the oscillating red light in their sights. For others, it was the love they had for special effects that were fairly evolutionary for their time. Many people forget about the state of special effects during the late 70's, especially those on television. For some, the memories of the story arc. Others still remember the relationships how the relationships helped to overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I come from the latter group. The core of Battlestar Galactica were the people who pulled together to save each other from an evil kingdom. Yes, evil. The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extinction of humanity, but they did it. While the base revolves around stars, men and women gathered to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology or more firepower. They survived because they cared for and trusted each other to go to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its faults, and sometimes it was juicy, but they were people you care about. <Br /> <br /> The authors of this current version never understood it. In some ways he adopted the least significant part of the original show, the character's names and a story, and made them nothing less than a rediscovery of television science fiction. As this was their goal, they could be judged on how well they achieved it: failure. It was far from revival. In fact, in many ways it was one of the most derivative of science fiction in a long time. It borrows liberally from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5, and even Battlefield Earth. I find it unhappy. <br /> <br /> For over a decade, Ronald D. Moore has contributed to popular science fiction and has also contributed to some of the most popular television fiction you can see. . One of the problems he apparently had was that there was no conflict in the D & E's bridge staff. It was the irreconcilable rule of Roddenberry's ST: TNG. Like many who have lived under the rules of others, who then use every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority, Ron Moore forgets some of the lessons he has learned under the recognized science fiction master : Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best story possible, he created a dysfunctional role as I have ever seen with the aim of creating as much cast conflict as he could. Except that it was dysfunctional, it was not the least credible. Anyone who has ever been in the army knows that someone who becomes unaware of a superior official could not only get in hack for a few days, they could have got the execution and they would never come out the next day . This would not have happened, especially in the time of war. <br /> <br /> The thing I remember most about Ron Moore's previous work was that he was the one who killed Capt. James Kirk donated. He has Capt. Kirk murdered. And for me he killed Battlestar Galactica.
