Too many secondary plot lines without primary one. Too many hot buttons are pushed for no reason, they managed to stuff this boring movie, which says nothing, with every drama element out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse , acceptance, rejected love, travel problems, sex, sex misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep true love" ?? You'd think it would make for an interesting movie, but hell no ?? all these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the 'super-deep' (and super-long) reading to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. Sorry. <br /> <br /> Forget to mention: the actors, all of them, are pretty good. It kept me from doing this. Too bad are their talents destroyed. The movie is also well shot: the light, the movement, etc. From every episode. It's all in place. It's just the missing meaning.
