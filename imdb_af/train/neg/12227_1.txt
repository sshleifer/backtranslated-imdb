It may be the worst movie ever made, and may just be worth seeing. Streisand is incredibly unbelievable as a young woman advocating a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is scary, with Barbara ending up with the worst leaves ever placed in the film. And don't even let me start on the plot. You will actually get more chuckles from this movie than many comedies because it is so horrible. Streisand's turbulent ego thinks she can raise the stinker at Oscar height, this led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this movie and never forgiven Streisand. I can't blame him. This movie is like seeing a car wreck for two hours. The soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' is played backwards on an old turntable. It's really that bad. I'm surprised someone from Streisand enjoys this movie at the level it is meant for.
