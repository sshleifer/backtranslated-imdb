I probably see 200 movies a year, both at theaters and at home and I can confidently say that this movie is by far the worst I have seen this year. (If I didn't ever see, I didn't actually see "Quest of the Delta Knights" yet). This movie is just a bad joke after a bad joke aimed at the 13-year-old and because I was unhappy about seeing it on a bus ride, I couldn't get out. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and save it over one in the rental path. The four dollars can be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
