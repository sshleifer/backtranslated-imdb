From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchurian Candidate in 1962), this confused story of political intrigue and murder comes. The story, which is told in almost comic strip, is hard to swallow. Consider All-Star Cast, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew: the novel was full of the same shortcomings. It seems the story actually mocks the more sincere attempt in "Manchurian Candidate". A disappointment at all points.
