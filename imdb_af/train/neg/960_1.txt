Oh, dear. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of Japan's Ringu. Well, I think the US also made their version of it, but at least it was a direct remake. So, so sad. I enjoy Filipino movies and know that some good things can come from such a small country, so I can't believe it should happen. Claudine and Kris are so big names there, surprised that they will be affiliated with plagiarism. For any aspiring filmmakers out there in the Philippines: You don't have to make these layers to earn money. There are many movie buffs that watch the movies Filipinos sit and enjoy!
