This movie was another waste of time ... Why, oh, why do I keep such a crap? ... someone please tell me ... * Suck * Oh well. Back to the movie at hand: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really enjoy the first movie, as I did, and just want to watch what was washed up in the last (hopefully) movie just to keep the poor actors and screenwriters employed Then of course it's the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot ... * Evil grin * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK, I lie ... At best, this movie sucks. OK, I have to admit that some elements were cool. Well .. cool. And I laughed quite a few times with the wrong things, but still I was amused. :-) But in all the few things that hardly make the category "ok", it's not enough to make this movie worthwhile. Unless you count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the top ten movies ever!
