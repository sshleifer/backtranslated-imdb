I felt this movie started well. The acting was up and I felt for all the character situations, although the true family unit was not completely revealed. We never had enough information about the father to really feel his pain for his entire involvement or the building up of his hostility with Tobe. I mean in one scene you see him admiring for intensity and in another scene he just takes off her head. Another problem with the movie was just unraveling and losing all the focus towards the end, and I begged it to be over. Any movie with such a long stretched and painful end should never get an automatic score of 7 or higher just for the play. We look at the whole quality of the movie experience. In the case of this movie, the end is so bad that I seriously thought about just going out of the theater. This movie pulled me in and just threw me out.
