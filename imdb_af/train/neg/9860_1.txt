I usually enjoy movies like this. It's shot documentary style, but the acting and writing are just awful. The acting is wood and stiff and the writing is just as clich√©, but not good at all. As for typing, I'm surprised it is on a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I'm sure most of these voices should come from people's family in the movie. If so, you might be able to manage a few laughs, because it's always funny to see that your family / friends are making a movie. Well, in a way, I think, it gives hope to writers, directors, actors, etc. To get it, because if they can do that, you can do it. Although, maybe you shouldn't.
