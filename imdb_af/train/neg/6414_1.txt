It's at the farthest cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It hardly made sense. It wasn't scary (unless you were screaming like loud noises and screams?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar had to stop with these scary movies. I think everyone in the theater agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits rolled up. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies ever made, this is how it goes: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason I made Silent Hill 3rd was because it showed scary scenes, but the rest was absolutely cr4p. The same with cabin fever, doesn't make sense, but the return went up that list. Its worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever put together
