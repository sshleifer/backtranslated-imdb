I wish Spike Lee had chosen another title for his movie. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It's not. It is a keen earthly portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of '77, when Berkowitz terrorized that city. <br /> <br /> The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American environment, and their responses to the Son of Sam threat. There is Vinny and his wife Dionna; there are Richie and Ruby, and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not nice. They are often annoying, and sometimes unbearable. Lee then promises their high energy, chaotic lives, full of anger, lust, and general unrest. There are at least two protracted scenes between Vinny and his wife, superfluous disco dance scenes, many gabfests ... Over and over I wondered: where is the film editor? Meanwhile, with all that bulk, the film passes the chance to produce any real sense of fear or fear arising from the Sun of Sam threat, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different kind of threat arising from neighborhood vigilant groups. <br /> <br /> The acting is uniformly good. This, combined with the 70-year-old disco music, and excessive attention to costumes and production design, make you feel that you were in an Italian-American environment in NYC in 1977. <br /> <br /> The atmospheric authenticity of the movie is not nearly enough to compensate for an overwhelming writing about the lives of many annoying people.
