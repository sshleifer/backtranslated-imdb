I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission, and let me tell you, you'll watch anything under such circumstances. Not this piece. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes show off poor porn movie quality acting, weird, out-of-the-blue plot twists and incredible situations and behaviors. It gets worse than that. This movie does not have a single saving grace, yet it is not bad in a way that will make it funny. It's just awful. I've seen quite a few movies in my life, and I'm not one of those snobbies. I mean that I will enjoy most movies to some extent, even if they are bad. This one ... man. <br /> <br /> Stir _well_ away from this one, my friend.
