Watch it on DVD in original language with English subs. Either the captions were very poor or the actual dialogue didn't make much of the story and gave any character development. There are quite a few HK stars in, but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive to the sheer colors and brilliance, but this can be overwhelming for a long time. If that means anything, I think of a child's movie with its unintentional barrage of CG, combat scenes and a villain. I'm sure I understood what happened in the movie, but the whole delivery of the story was pretty common.
