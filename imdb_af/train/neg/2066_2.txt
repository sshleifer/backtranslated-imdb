Uber-stupid frat boys who still find JACKASS or Tom Green mainly, will of course come up with the idea of ​​faecal matter coming out of the tube, SEX OLYMPICS (I don't really need you, and I) and a clown what basically the little I don't love so much, I think I have seen about ninety times, it will eat like thickets. Well, more power for you. <br /> <br /> I just want to print it out, Despite what you've heard, this movie was by no means a model for the infinitely more funny movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what.
