The No One Sleeps plot line is not a bad idea, and the subject is of some interest. But by watching this movie, we said aloud, "These filmmakers are struggling to find good places, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" In the course of the film the sound was echoyed, messed up and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There are some good plays in this movie, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would be worth doing as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> I just can't repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to sound. Sound is so much part of a movie as the image, and it's worth doing right. Could have earned a 6.
