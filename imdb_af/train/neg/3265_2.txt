I had no idea what audience director George Schlatter was hoping to sell this comedy. With Redd Foxx in the central role and plenty of pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet throughout the 1970s, "Norman" plays like a beating picture, combined with a number of dim sitcom episodes that include comic misunderstandings, not an elongated cameo. by Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a estranged couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learns the hard way their son is secretly gay - shocked jokes about any early episode of "Three's Company" too shy. Bailey keeps her dignity, and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for some chuckles, but the rest of the artists are humiliated. * of ****
