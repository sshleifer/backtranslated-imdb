As a former submarine, it was one of the worst submarine movies I've ever seen. First, a mutiny aboard a US Navy ship, especially a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is wonderful and they take it very seriously from the Captain to the most junior crew member. I could never see a crew of any ship that divided their alliance between the Captain and the Chief Executive Officer. An executive who acted as the character Denzel Washington played would have been rid of his duties and Court Martialed, and then drowned out of the Navy. It is no surprise that the fleet refused to send a technical advisor to help this movie. Finally, if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made on this vessel, they would be severely reprimanded. Submarines learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to prevent detection. They do not sneak doors and even talk quietly and wear soft-insulated shoes when they are in operation. I was amazed at how hard they portrayed the crew while they were going. Loud music will never be tolerated. I know how to portray the submarine life, in fact, movie tickets will not sell, but it is the point to be ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
