What a horrible movie! The idea of ​​robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action ridiculous, acting non-existent and special effects (on which this kind of movie should depend) are archaic. I thought it had to be done around '80 -'84 and was surprised to see it was from 1990. It's 5 years after Aliens! OK, many people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think 'what is the point?' it looks totally incredible. I won't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a totally rewritten story, because I still like the idea of ​​big robots being scratched.
