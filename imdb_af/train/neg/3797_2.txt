Years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled upon the horrible plot involved in replacing people with machines, but since then a war between cyborgs and people has arisen and we has been lost, now is a super-woman whose daughter is Olivier Gruner's character (she also owns only half of his minimal acting ability). I think the movies are minimal connection to the first, but when the superwoman is created, she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter of the future holds her in this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, which I can see why people liked it, even though I wasn't a fan of the movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and give tons of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it is a cheap tear from The Terminator with a muscular woman who is so low on the acting ability that she looks like a master damper and the action ranges are lacking in the explosive range which was the main selling point of the original. I will admit I wasn't a fan of the original, but it deserves a better follow-up than that. The original also had a good movie such as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley. This one has no one and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious atmosphere. In fact, after I saw it, it inspired me to add half a star to the original. <br /> <br /> * From 4- (Bad)
