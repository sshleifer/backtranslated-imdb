It is a very bare and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most lively plays. I can only guess the intention was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that was not previously exposed to Shakespeare. In doing so, however, they drained the game of life and turned into a flat caricature. Somehow it is actually boring - a very hard thing given such wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The play is at best comparable - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. However, others are not that good. April Shawnham's Hero is a quirky, breathtaking aerial head that often produces profits. Jerry Mayer's Don John is an indifferent cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash (although Snidley was much nicer). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the man who murdered Mozart) is not in this version unless he was in disguise and his name was removed from the credits. <br /> <br /> Given that producer Joseph Papp is basically a theatrical god, this production is not only disappointing, but also scary. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this. See Branagh's many Ado instead - his version is full of vitality and humor, to say nothing of wonderful performances.
