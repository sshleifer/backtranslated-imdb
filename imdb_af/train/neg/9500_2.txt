This movie is really bad. The acting is simply awful except Michael Ironside. I don't get the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a battle between two Mc gangs. He comes to a town and suddenly he is chosen to fight the bad people who want Indian land. In front he said he was an Indian self who had returned to his hometown. I didn't hear it in the movie. If not, it wasn't clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He said his lines also liked it. And we don't want to talk about Sean Young, she's not one of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She's terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this one because Michael Ironside was in the role. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Don't see it unless you think Richard Grieco looks difficult on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I will soon get the cast list because I have it at home. I wrote it off after I saw the movie.
