1914 was a wonderful year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and he has appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these movies were not very good, they gave him the opportunity to slowly develop his pacifier. In this film, however, the famous "Little Tramp" character was still evolving. Certainly Charlie watched the part, but his character still lacks the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit people suddenly, kicked, or seemed to have no reason. <br /> <br /> As for this very light movie, it is interesting to watch for the cast. While not known today, Chaplin, along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, are all extremely popular stars with Keystone Movies. The problem with this movie is that while it has some nice scenes, the plot is very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel came to the racetrack (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it had to be located near a racetrack). Charlie and Mack appear and sneak in. Mack is being chased by the police to do so while Charlie Chester shuts down and steals his girlfriend. Eventually, for the obvious reason, police took Chester and Mack away. Charlie is left with Mabel (who was strange, did not show Charlie's drilling behavior). Unless you're a big quiet comedy buff or movie historian, it's a very forgotten movie that's just important in Chaplin's evolution. What he and the other actors actually do on stage, while not uncommon for a Keystone movie, is not very funny when seen today.
