If there was a scale of less than 1, it would get a -10, followed in the footsteps of Godspell. The acting (if any) was frightening, the plot interrelated. And Rene Russo was sickly sweet in her role, enough to make someone recover. Ten inches off for a silly movie. Salvation of Grace: kudos for era costuming.
