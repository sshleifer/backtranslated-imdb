Roy Rogers and the company are trying to bring back "Sintown" - this is a ghost town that can go on if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") wraps around. Jane Frazee (like Carol) loses a bit of her bitches to Mr. Rogers' sharp teachings. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or is it sing-in?) For the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Pioneer Boys. James Finlayson (of the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look of the "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floor plan offers the winning comedy show. Mr. Devine's mule kicks his heels. There are also energetic human performances, but the material is not large. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
