Shame on it! There I was comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another beautiful Muppet evening of entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets get out of this sublime Christmas? The humor was terrible, the songs were worse than the country and the west (and it says something) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the biggest problem was that they were trying too much to try Treasure Island. A short story, such as Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can weave the Muppet whore jackets around ... here's the need to drag the plot, all the fun stopped. Where are the Muppets going next? What about Oz's Muppets wizard?
