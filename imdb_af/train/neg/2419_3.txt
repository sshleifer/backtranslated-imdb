I only give it a three because it fulfills what my friends do and I hoped it would: entertain. <br /> <br /> I wasn't stupid enough to hire these thoughts, but it would be a zombie movie, like Romero or Fulci, but for which I rented it was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for entertainment, or a movie to shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. It's ideal for junior "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it's so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> I, personally, think it's a pity to relate it to any other Hollywood title we might know, because if a movie sucks, it has its own genre.
