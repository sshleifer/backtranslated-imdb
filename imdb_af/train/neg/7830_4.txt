So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been volatile and disappointing. The first segment, led by Brian Henson, offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or true scares, but it was at least well-directed, exciting and visually interesting, with a solid play by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini series. <br /> <br /> The second story in the series, however, was just terrifying and not in the right way. The script is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikely protagonists to act illegally to move the plot and make characters unlimited for some, unnecessary exposition. The acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and in the first story I had much more empathy for a cold killer than for the newly married couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to make the story haunting, but with the amateur-like performance and writing, the end result looks like a first-year film school project, with the camera moving for its own name and little in the way of plot. or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series goes on like this, I'll drop a lot. Looking forward to William H. Macy's installment, he hopes to get a decent director and scriptwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is too much contradiction to predict any way.
