Three authors have made a brave effort to adapt Jane Stanton's Hitchcock novel to the tube, but this television movie was eventually injected with too much melodrama and didn't know when to stop. Struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by rich, enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last event being held there - Ellen's daughter's outreach party - Tilly decides on her artistic theme and never dreams that the daughter had died mysteriously before the function even began, and that she and the deceased were a striking have agreement with each other. ! Two beautiful actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn that is not carefully checked, one that does not match the lady of emotional intensity. Burstyn's role plays on the camp, while Tilly is held with the dreamy-eye routine. Only one series late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is loaded with honest feelings, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
