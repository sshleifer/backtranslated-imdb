This movie has the potential to be really good, as some of the album elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actor THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always appeals to his roles. But somebody really left the ball somewhere on this one somewhere. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a kicking monk (!) traveling to New York to get a key that opens a door under his monastery that captured the antichrist for 2000 years. He must fight the camp, who is a spirit that jumps from body to body, as the HIDDEN and JASON GO TO HELL. The minion obviously wants the key, so it can leave out the antichrist. Along the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the mini-owned bodies. <br /> <br /> If I am entertaining this sound, forget it. The pacing is very uncomfortable and slow, the acting sub-paragraph at its best, and the battle scenes have deteriorated. Dolph strikes through his role and spits out the worst dialogue of his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor really comes to an end when the minion hits an army of machine-washing monks in the monastery, but the rest of this movie is a snooze. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted it.
