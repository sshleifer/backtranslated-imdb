There were really big horror movies in the seventies, but this movie is certainly not one of them! It's a shame. The Child is no better, as it works from a decent idea that takes some sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of ​​a shaky child, who worked so well in classic movies like The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which is of course the backbone of many successful horror movies. The plot is basically this: a young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to take revenge (like you). It's all good and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens to most of the movies, and although it does end up with beautiful gore. it is not enough to justify a final to sit through the rest of it. The film is clearly shot at a budget, as the places look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There really isn't much I can say about the movie overall, because there's not much about it. The Child is a bad seventies horror flick and I definitely don't recommend it.
