Things are fatally written earlier in this jazz bio-fiction and directed by Spike Lee. <br /> <br /> Pale Gilliam (Denzell Washington) is a jazz trumpet that happens to a quintet packaged in the bottom. the Underdog. His problems include an incompetent driver, a sax player and two girlfriends playing with musical mattress. However, the true love of his life is his trumpet and his music. The group's manager, Giant, has a dangerous gambling problem and appears to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and will be the best, but Bleek remains as long as possible. It will prove that he is being withdrawn as an artist, but ironically contributes to his growth as a man. <br /> <br /> As Pale, Denzell Washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpet with a babe on each arm. He is too sweet a man to be so self-centered about his art, giving patience and love to those close to him with a low key distance. He simply misses the fire. Wesley Snipes who plays Henderson's sax player would have been much more suited to the role, but even he will have to pronounce the flaming throws of Lee's torpedic dialogue. As Giant, Lee hits the trifecta with a varied show to match his writing and direction. He tries to mirror mirrored but sympathetic Ratso Rizzo in Bleek's Joe Buck. He accepts a slack and even the "I'm here for a moment of Midnight Cowboy. In this case, you want the taxi to overflow and get done with it. <br /> <br /> Lee's script is all lazy argument , heavy-handed ripple and veil insult with some improper editorialization that Lee has to inject to stay down. The scenes between the background of the group members and in rehearsal lack a spark and are only made by the Bleek, Giant talks with a Ad lib looks and overtakes in circles Completion of this transvesty is Lee's pretentious visual style, tracing shots, zooming and pans wasted and meaningless to scenes, they just wandered. <br /> <br /> Blues are Lee Jazz's love letter for jazz (implicitly made of memorabilia mountains plastered over) and it's all sentimental trap that lacks passion and bliss. Jazz on film is better served by Tavernier's "Round Midnight" and Eastwood's "Bird" that comes under the surface reveals the shape, the pain outside, and additional infinite headlines by Forrest Whitaker and the real deal Dexter Gordon. This Spike Lee joint doesn't even offer a soft buzz. It's a little bad homemade.
