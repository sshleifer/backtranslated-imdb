There are many pretentious people out there who would pretend that it is equipped with some kind of beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me don't get it. Of course, that means we have to stick to Hollywood Dross. <br /> <br /> It has every a-hem, artistic clich√© in the book. It's good that the director is one of the chosen couple. Almost a self-pity drowns in its own appearance. <br /> <br /> The director of the (almost embarrassing) movie "Ratcatcher" comes back with another piece moving in artistic nonsense; It is difficult to understand and apparently a study of alienation. The best way to describe this movie is to alienate its viewers.
