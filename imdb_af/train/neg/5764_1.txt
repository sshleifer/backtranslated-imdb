Scary Movie 3 is such a stink, it's hard to put it into words. It makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material. Let's say that. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was wonderful, one of the better 90's flippers, coming from a good team that previously had our rock. world with no threat to the south central while drinking your juice in the hood. But what happened to hell? After the tragedy that Scary Movie 2 was, I thought it would help change the role and crew, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> Within 20 minutes I smiled twice. Not one laugh, the jokes were reclaimed and originality was of course no factor. The fact that most people on this site voted in writing at this stage made me feel physically ill. When there is a big movie like School of Rock, which actually has jokes that are funny, somebody wasting their money on such a lot must be investigated. <br /> <br /> No stars / ****
