Perhaps, because I was so young, innocent and BREINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen it since I was in a Presbyterian school in the seventh grade, so I don't know what effect this will have on me. However, I would say it left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. It served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was especially afraid of what the newly converted post-rapture Christians had to endure when they didn't receive the animal's mark. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it. I won't mention details of the screens, but I can still imagine them in my head ... and that's 19 years.
