With a Bo Derek movie, the audience just gets what they expect. A paper thin plot and some shots of Mrs. Derek in no clothes. "Ghosts can't do that" is just like that. The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in many different roles, but even a well-known actor seems to have to work for money. Above Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly attractive young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a total waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude women or bad acting, rent any porn movies.
