... the first movie I had to run. And it was the shield and crew (Not that I was involved, I soon added). I did it by the first hour, so I think I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how did it get through any form of QA. An accumulation of the worst in dialogue, the feature of woodworking, terrible castings, all wrapped without a plot. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comical. She has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> When I left the show, the director and producers drank in a pub outside the theater. They couldn't even think it again. <br /> <br />
