I was bored at 10pm so I watched this movie. And I couldn't stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids act like they were older than 11 just cracked me. One of the children had a ring, which supposedly killed people after 3 or so years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gunman. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act like everything is such a big problem, as if Billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms, then the world will end. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie for little ones. that a 5-year-old says "penis", but not for teenagers or adults who don't want to waste their time.
