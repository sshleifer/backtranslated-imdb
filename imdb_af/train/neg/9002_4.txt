OK .... I only have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESY! The only redeeming feature of this movie is Dean Cain. Other than that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !! <br /> <br /> The movie has a promise in the concept. An underground lab creates a truly live fire-breathing dragon that basically meets us more of Jurassic Park. "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great possibilities, but they just don't follow .... The special effects are decent - although you know the dragon is CGI, it doesn't look like CGI. .. <br /> <br /> I won't be blamed on Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers), I'll give more money to Phillip Roth - the director and writer. It's his job to make this movie .... and unfortunately he failed.
