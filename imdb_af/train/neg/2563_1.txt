This movie was on the other day and I didn't enjoy it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the successor .... totally terrible. The new actor and actress playing the lead, was not good at all, they had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and original actress (I forgot her name) so this movie gets the 0 out of 10 rating, not a movie what you can sit and watch, it's a movie you change to another channel or take it back to the store if it's rented or bought. It was nice to see Aap back the monkey, but was not as fun as the first, they had to grow up the new George as Georges boy, and still had Bredon and (his face) in the movie, I was a little better than it was.
