Slow and mysterious with inaccuracy. It is still an interesting version of the Alamo's famous and heroic siege during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Kol Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This TV project also features stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
