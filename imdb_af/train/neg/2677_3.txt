It's a very cute parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, the humor's cheesy, and so is the play. But it is a soft core movie that is expected and does not matter, because what you really want is the sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, there is hardly any of it. What makes you feel like watching television for 3 hours and playing the independent movies and the one being turned on is made by a college kid who's not going anywhere in that industry. For a long time you left behind for a real sex scene, many times you think something is going to happen, then you just stopped hanging out. The one (maybe two, or one with two parts) actually going somewhere, however, is very pleasant. I can't personally recommend it unless you've found it in a clear bucket for a dollar or two. If you want good luck with a plot and good acting for a good movie, you don't want it. If you are looking for a good soft lesbian movie, you don't want it either.
