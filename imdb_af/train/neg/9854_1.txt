This documentary documentation (or I have to say) is the perfect example of how ridiculous people can be when they have so much enthusiasm. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It's science, it just destroys it. But something positive in this was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this documentary document is completely fake, and it's really disappointing because it comes from scientists. That's why it's a 1 in 10 and not a 0. An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea: It is true that Chemistry produced the hydrogen in the stomach, but it is impossible to produce in those relationships You need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon's stomach. There are many substances that are hydrogen in nature, but not the necessity of running such an animal, and the hydrogen does not come from nothing, so it is impossible. Anyway, there's actually something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: This element is harder to find than gold, and I can't explain how the dragons depend on it. It is ridiculous, they offer dragons like low-chance creatures to conquer planet Earth, but at least it explains why they have become extinct. Probably cryptologist calls themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies like this author, and what's the worst, some people buy them. But I don't think a person who cares for Science will believe in dragons after watching it. These false scientists are wasting their time.
