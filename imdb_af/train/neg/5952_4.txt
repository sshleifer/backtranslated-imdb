You realize you've watched the FIRST COUNTRY for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity to see strangers coexist on an island, but you would think that after not watching, stink-loaded heroes ran through the forest with an egg on a spoon for Half a decade will be enough to get to do something that is something more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the display validity that I find questionable for the record. It is just hard to suspend unbelief for Bushy Bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air-conditioned make-shift bio-dome that smells cold mochin with moxy. <br /> <br /> What is the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their meandering lives. I just can't get it. But if you impress yourself with hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you switch off your TV and just go to your local bus station, where you can see such people in their TRUE habitat. They call them HOMELOSE PEOPLE, and for free you can sit back and marvel at their impossible ability to get multiple cigarette drums from an abundance of rubbish bins. They finally got a "paid rubbish" and a homemade Dr Frankenstein-style cancer stick, all the time to ask people for food change when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to look different. set. And the best part? Just like Survivor, every week, one member of the "Leaves" tribe becomes the "Island" when they are sent unnecessarily to the local institution when the terrifying unmedicated state of full-scale schizophrenia comes ready! Now it's fun!
