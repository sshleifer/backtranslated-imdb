"It's not such a big mechanical toy," says a character early in the commentary on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" just wants an animal as convincing as the shark of the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are terrible. Acting and directing is also not much better; They look more suitable for a deodorant or bubble gum commercial than a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt, not only for the genre, but also for the audience. To say that you liked this movie, only encourage filmmakers to give us more of this crap and further destroy the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
