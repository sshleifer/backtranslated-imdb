The perfect murder is cursed when a woman (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who helped this episode), who kills her husband with a poker, has the misfortune to receive a visitor as she is about to move the body outside. And escape the madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit (played by a devastating outrageous Larry Drake). She strives for her life as she tries to find a way to hide her husband's body. She decides to use an ax as soon as she drops the Santa killer, who misses several chances to chop the woman's head, to fix the killer for her husband's murder. Santa swallows her in a cupboard and strives for the woman's daughter, as she desperately tries to free herself to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of CRYPT TALES only recovers tired material that is the old "Santa Death" theme while also using the regular (nauseum) woman-murder-her-man-for-one -man-to-be-cheating with routine add. It is mainly Trainer who tries to find a way to prevent him from being caught with a dead body that she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot that pretty much goes through the moves. Not one of the highlights of the shows.
