The head of a common New York family, Jane Gail (like Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) at Smyrner's Candy Store. Mrs. Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) have to save the virtually endangered young woman. <br /> <br /> After me. Grandin was abducted by merchants in buying and selling women as prostitutes. "Soul traffic" has a hard-to-support reputation - it is not remarkably well done, and it does not show much in the face of a young woman's "virtue" being threatened by sex traders. Perhaps it could be supported as a movie that covered the subject in greater than ordinary length (claiming it was ten roles, original). The New York City screens have been the main attraction for many years. The panning of the prisoners behind bars is unforgettable, because nothing else seems to be able to move the cameras. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in Siele (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
