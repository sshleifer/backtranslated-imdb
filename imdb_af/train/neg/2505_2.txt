I've seen enough of both Little Richard in interviews and in performances and plenty of poor Leon saw in these 50s / 60s musicals that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but completely failed to capture the essence of Little Richard in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in "Why do fools fall in love?" was a much more appropriate choice after he pulled out the musician's powerful but slight person. <br /> <br /> If the shows aren't convincing, the movie will be so good. And that's what happened here. Gloss about or missed completely is LR's ban on homosexuality and voyeurism. What the "temptation" has done so well to catch the rise of the group, warts and everyone, misses this film with a wide point. <br /> <br /> What happens to director Robert Townsend who started so well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He is a talented, funny man, but has done nothing near that first attempt.
