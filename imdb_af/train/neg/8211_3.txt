I read Heinrich Harrer's book "7 Years in Tibet" and was fascinated by it. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98, I loved it so much. Well, now I have looked it in full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how wrong it was all told: <br /> <br /> When they enter Lhasa, people start their tongue out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that this is the way to hello in Tibet to say, so greet them back. In the book, Harrer, who is sticking out the tongue, is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet and they can do it before the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! Not only the mother, but even the Dalai Lama herself has glasses in the public. In the book called Harrer, no one in Tibet wore glasses at the same time (sorry for the reason, but it is also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! And how about the Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala before the young "living buddha" ?? childish ... and tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes not European designer suits! Why are so many events really out of the story just to fill the time with a fictitious love interest (the female partner ...) that is totally unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. There is not one word about him or even any relative of her hair in the book. but it was OK for me, because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about a harrers person. it's about tibet. I'm very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. And I'm sure Heinrich Harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for the movies.
