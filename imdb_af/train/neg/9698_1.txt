There are now many talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. None of them are associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like that? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this garbage! It is not entertaining to have seven adult men walking around like dwarfs, as if they were funny. What is funny though is that the film's producer (who is the oldest man of the bunch) plays the youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with moments that scream for captions: "You must laugh now!" It's hard to believe that this crap is supposed to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people actually got up and left the cinema in the movie for 30 minutes. I had to do the same instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
