"Indian Cemetery": If these three words appear anywhere in a property list, look for another neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler boy move into a Maine house next to a pet cemetery - and after an l-o-o-ng-hike, an old Indian cemetery. Looks like the Indian soil can bring Fido or Fluffy back from death - if you don't mind having a pet pet. It can do the same for dead people - if you don't mind having a murderous zombie around the house. <br /> <br /> Throw in a busy two-track black top, fast-paced, well-intentioned as a little dull old neighbor and one child who doesn't get enough supervision and I think you can find out what's going on happens - an exaggerated, illogical mess that offers in all fairness There are a few frightens. <br /> <br /> Well, there are worse Stephen King adjustments (such as "Maximum Overdrive", which King also directed). But there is also much better (like "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
