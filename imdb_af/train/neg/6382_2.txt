It's hard to know what Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg's heads went to when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space". The movie is being charged as a comedy, but there are no real jokes along the rough characters (Capt. B. Dick, Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the movie is a (supposedly) unintentional funny relationship with ridiculous unsynchronized voice surveys (with the 'actors' reading their lines basically without sentences), 'futuristic' computer screens with misspellings and a plot that makes almost no sense. Although 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, it's the opposite of what a good movie is. It can be experienced to look with friends, but this movie only earns a '2' out of ten ... slightly higher than the lower possible rating, just because the authors somehow managed to get some black to get guys. star in this movie.
