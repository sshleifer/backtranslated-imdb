This film wants to expand that criminals are a product of modern society. So can thieves, rapists and murderers (the killer of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods) all three and worse) be fully accountable for their actions? An interesting idea, but very difficult to bring intellectually and emotionally satisfactorily to the screen. And that's where Killer: A Murder magazine falls short. Although the film is trying to put Panzram's behavior in perspective, with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional education, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit. Sure, the system is corrupt, with one mobster occupying the entire sick bay of the Leavenworth prison (where most of the movie takes place), most prison guards are sadistic bulls and the prison director is something like a megalomanic despot. But why, on earth, is the new jailer, Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) so sorry for Panzram? Even after reading his horror journals? The film offers some explanation: Little Witnesses Panzram is watched by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) and is impressed by Panzram's intelligence (although it is not clear why Lesser thinks this man is so clever). It is not enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram, although this movie tends to relieve his crimes and highlight his personality? For Klein, Panzram is fairly loyal and the viewer gets the impression that it weighs heavier on Klein than all the atrocities he read in Panzram's diaries. Does this man Lesser have so few friends he takes, all who are only remotely friendly to him? Perhaps it is Lesser who is a product of modern society that judges appearance rather than content. <br /> <br /> I can envisage Monster, with Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie that is about the same themes with far more integrity and scope. <br /> <br /> VAT: Killer looks like it's been shot for TV (not so good)
