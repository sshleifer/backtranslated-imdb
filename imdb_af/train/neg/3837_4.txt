I've seen too many movies from this company - this one is about the middle of the pack. One of the good things, it's a little more stylized and under control than some of their prize - less of the sophomorical efforts to make humor and more adaptable to the story (for what is worth it). Many of their titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateur sensibility. On the other hand, I didn't find the simulated sex scenes as hot as some of their other movies (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always a 10 on the Peter meter, like Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce warm in a school breeze, and Ruby LaRocca is a sexy little hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch it with the distance firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porn. Don't waste your time watching the story - you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but not that standard.
