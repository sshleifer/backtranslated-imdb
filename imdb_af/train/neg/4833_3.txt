Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Avatar Oscars just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to strengthen the acceptance (support?) For the wars. USA is still fighting today. I don't really want to go here in politics, but come on, it's clearer than the summer sky. Hurt locker doesn't really have anything outstanding, no real plot. I really feel in the 50's of Hungary when the party told people what to keep and what not to like. The same propaganda movies were produced at that time, except that it was black and white. Even if we consider this title, a fair bit of "American wars cool" genre, you definitely have much better movies to choose from.
