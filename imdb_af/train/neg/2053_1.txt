Why do they insist on repeating big movies like "High Noon"? From here forever? And this one? <br /> <br /> Why do they think the color is more attractive to a viewer than black and white? Why did Robert insist on wearing that dull, broad-leaved baseball cap? It made him look like Jim Varney. Why would anyone spend? four hours of suffering? <br /> <br /> Look at the original. Then you won't have to ask yourself why.
