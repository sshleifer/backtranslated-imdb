College students who clear a convicted residence are jammed by an elusive killer. <br /> <br /> The Dorm driven (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for treasure fans. The movie production values ​​are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there is even a creepy bum to hang around for a red herring. In fact, many of the story's build-up is pretty forgotten, except for one or two brutal murders. But the film is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and a fairly fat, unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the cast is slim. Stephen Sachs is the best of the party, as he has a nice, casual character. Also look at a young Daphne Zuniga as a bad student. <br /> <br /> All this is a nice standard B slasher effort, but the finale is worth enjoying and for this viewer the movie rescued from a complete hoom. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
