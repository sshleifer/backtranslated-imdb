I saw the movie last night and I really wanted it. My expectations for the movie have been going up and down since I heard it was made. Some days I see something spectacular and some days I will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> However, I am the kind of fan I am, I have a lot of hope for this movie, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> While I love the Richard Donner movies, I didn't like their sometimes campus nature, or the changes they made to Superman's character and his powers. <br /> <br /> However, Sanger chose the worst elements of the Donner movies and put it in his version. <br /> <br /> While being slightly darker, Lex Luthor is nothing more than a hamster, a man and a common criminal. He is no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played it. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but ultimately he becomes a victim of slander and unbeatable dialogue. <br /> <br /> His henchmen are more two-dimensional than even cartoonists. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as me. Tesmacher. She looks like angry and cold like Lex Luthor, but she seems to be just another one that melts after seeing Superman in trouble and predicting Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White. I wasn't a big fan of the top Perry White in the Donner movies, but at least he had a soul. He said at the time and said, a veteran reporter who cares about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing but a corporate joke. He wants everyone to focus on the Superman-related stories because they sell newspapers, although every other paper does the same thing. He doesn't care about the real stories, the real secrets like the black ones and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he's out of prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that he is DULL! Some actors can be quiet and sober, but still have an undercurrent that tells you that the water is still running deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He is OK, but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie. Not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look graceful, because even the slightest movement of his fingers influences the way he flies. But it still looks choreographic and artificial. <br /> <br /> While writing poorly, Lois Lane performed surprisingly well by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, she is again a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and writer, as eloquent as any teenager on Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any superpowers he controls Lois Lane's message, flies a plane to the spot, boarding Luthor's hunt, and saving Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the movie is when they sink all trapped teat as it overflows with water and the ship. You see they are slowly being immersed in the water. You know that Superman will come to the last moment to save them, but you still can't help but sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is very random. Unlike Singer, it is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find its place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world welcomes him with open arms. Lois is the only one not happy to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him the chance to score the man with steel. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the stupid heroes in the universe. A large green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of jail. He now has knowledge of Superman's strengths and weaknesses. However, he still cannot connect the dots enough to know that Luthor Kryptonite would use him. <br /> <br /> According to the movie, the only thing Superman is good at is really very heavy stuff. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.
