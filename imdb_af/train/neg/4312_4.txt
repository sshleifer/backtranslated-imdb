This one serves as a satire during the women's rights movement era. Of course, this doesn't mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to see. It runs in the same year as FASTBREAK (which was better but still tame), and is basically standard boating. What I mean for this movie that is uninteresting is easy to recognize. Anyone who spends time away from a normal job by training a lot of lunatics who win their way to sudden victory, wastes waste. It is the same feeling you can get after watching it. A good effort to throw the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.
