wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this movie at the theater. Can't believe I wasted my time. The play is dignified and the special effects are rude. Probarly the worst writing in history, a few extremely embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear that God is 'swept away', better than that. Madonna must win and Oscar compared to these guys. A hundred and a half of my life I want to return. Honestly people don't see it, even toddlers will find this movie an insult to their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was difficult to tell who more wood is, these guys here of real dolls. pleasing guys do not waste your time on this movie, you will live to regret it.
