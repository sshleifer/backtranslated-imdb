This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (Joanne Dru's brother and later the perennial host of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan has been hyped as "the new Lewis and Martin", is only ashamed of scary: some random gags are inserted, all speak fast and nothing work right - there is one scene in which Noonan throws grenades at officers and politicians in anger; They are about five feet apart, Noonan throws them in, and the total response is that everyone is doing well. <br /> <br /> In the midst of a horror-lit horror by Julie Newmar, there are a few moments of clarity: Marshall and Noonan sometimes engage in double-talk and arguing clashes, and their timing is virtually perfect. It was clear that they were a healthy comedy couple. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turkey is not enough to save.
