It is interesting at first. A naive park guard (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane), who is only known shortly. They look happy, then she disappears without warning. He looks for her and, after a few dead enders, stumbles over some of her abused childhood and drunk past, which includes criminal activities. And then the movie makers don't seem to know what to do with the story. The start, though not as exciting as it sounds, is at least visible. Then it stops being interesting or even making a lot of sense. And the end is so paralyzed, so boring, and so without excitement or intelligence, you'd think the authors didn't know what to do with it and got bored. What a pity wasting a good idea!
