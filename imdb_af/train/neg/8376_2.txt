"Little Man", now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. This is the story of a smaller than a midget criminal who is played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a women's boot to an elevator. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, cook the brilliant plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant him at the woman's home. He then goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" like a chaos to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. I was amazed at how low the humor was in this movie. The jokes have been done in other places so many times that they are not cute or funny. I think almost the movie could have been harder if they didn't use CGI and used the little actor where Marlon's face was. In watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny in a miniature way, but they chose a different route. A few cameos and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes. Create your rental $ at Borat if you really want laughter. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
