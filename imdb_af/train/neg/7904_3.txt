Ridiculous-looking little bowlers that spray and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror elements this movie has. All the rest of MUNCHIES play like a really slow-down comedy that's so stupid, you won't find it funny about 15 minutes. I can imagine that small children are cheering for these little bowlers, but adults will only be left with the so-called "smart" references on the screens like Capt. Kirk's STAR TREK entries, the best-known scene of ET, a blatant statement by filmmakers go "Look! We pay for GREMLINS's success here!" and a cardboard cutout from Clint Eastwood tells us ... what about his western movies exactly? The last one was completely lost on me ... Oh, and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing. Don't know where they come from. <br /> <br /> Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most frivolous movie to go for. It's just really stupid. And if you manage to crack a smile while you watch it, you'll probably feel so stupid that you've done this after the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Good Bad? Yes, but only as "stupid", "delayed" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
