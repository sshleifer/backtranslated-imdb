I was keen to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big David Boreanaz fan. However, what I got was a 1-1 / 2 hour lunch. The premise was nice: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, the owner of a business called "Mr. Fix It", where dumped men help his back to get their friends back. <br /> <br /> Among the issues with this movie is the editing, mini-dissertation and acting. Although I was delighted with Boreanaz in his other role-plays (with the exception of the "Crow" movie he did), it was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting and different, flat. The supportive role reminded me of soap opera dayers. I realize it wasn't a big-budget movie, but some of the plays and music just didn't look right. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
