"I'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and I'm beginning to be confused about who I really am, sh * # t! I have a headache and things are shaky, oh no, here comes another near subliminal fast, noisy montage of meaningful but cryptic images ... '<br /> <br /> I rented this movie because the couple reviews from there were all favorable. Why? Cypher is a cheap, derivative, dull film located in a poorly realized, futuristic, wood-led, and ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> A strange sense that something interesting is going to happen, holds a series of increasingly stupid and unconvincing events before the filmmakers hit you with an end to the worst of Bond with Combine a Duran Duran video. It is painfully clear that they have copied the production by Dr Wie style improvised special effects to include some good (as a little Babylon 5) CGI chassis. This sub-fight club, under Philip K Dick's future noir thriller, strives for a much larger scope than its modest budget will allow. <br /> <br /> Cool blue mood with a po-faced seriousness - disappointing stupid. It's not an intelligent Sci-Fi, it's the plot of a computer game.
