The only scary thing about this movie is the idea that anyone who made it can make a sequel. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, "The Tooth Fairy" was just awful. It seemed as if a badly-active children's movie became confused with a "Wizard of Oz" witch melt and happy kiddies combined with some bad gore effects and curse. <br /> <br /> Half of the cast is totally unnecessary except that it is convenient to be murdered in one way or another. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald had nothing in the movie - they could have included them in the main chart for interesting interesting stories but apparently couldn't be bothered. The people watching the movie know the characters are there for some bloody death zone, but come on, at least PRY and have a little plot for them. The story in general is poor with erratic behavior of the characters that make them all eaten by the witch. <br /> <br /> Add the bad plot and the weak ones that work together (the kids are especially wood) and the movie ends a complete failure. If only MST3K could have had a little at this one ...
