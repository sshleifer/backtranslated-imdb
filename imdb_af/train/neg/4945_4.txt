Sure, this one is not really a hobby, and does not set such a position. "Dieter" is the name of a very popular German musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and that is exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" wrote a few years ago but is not aimed at being accurate. The film is filled with sexual offensive content (at least for American standard) that is amusing (or not for the other "actors") or stupid - it depends on your individual kind of humor or if you are a "Bohlen". -Or or not. Technically speaking, there is not much to criticize. I'm talking about this movie as an OK movie.
