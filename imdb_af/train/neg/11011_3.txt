A series of painstakingly infallible sketches that look forever and a day. Not as indignant as "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but it is by no means an endorsement in any way, sense or form. Features of the worst rhyme ever. Anyone who is not offensive to anyone, but most prudent or politically correct. It also has the worst song parody that EVER puts on film, the WORST Arnold image display EVER (not just the worst on film, literally the worst ever). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would die there (the reasons I looked at it in the first place). The only thing that was almost amusing was Dickman. Finally, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but the people who make it their mission to get it in the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something that is significant to your life. Plus, if that is true, the Scientific Church hides it, it can't be ALL bad. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
