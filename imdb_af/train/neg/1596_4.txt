None of the better pok√©mon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemon come in the story. You can see how strong Celebi can be, although he first gets angry. <br /> <br /> Suicune also looks, he didn't look so powerful. <br /> <br /> Don't have the Marauder Don't have very strong pokemon, except for those taraniters? Some road scenes with his pokemon can have made it better. <br /> <br /> If and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, though they don't realize it. Misty I thought had ended, but she didn't get close. I saw it in the credits. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
