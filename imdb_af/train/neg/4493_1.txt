I tried to remove something that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you have seen the first movie or at least know the common core, so if you do not have these things, it cannot make sense. <br /> <br /> Plot: This movie knocks the audience over the Head with tired philosophical ramblings over and over in an effort to convey the theme. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, destiny and choice, and forced to endure the long, bad platinum sessions they contain. Neo, waking up from a dream in the last movie, now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are many revelations in this movie, which I will be vague about, so they will not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you're still worried, vague references will spoil the movie, t read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith are revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love, and their temporary nature, are also revealed. The interdependence of people and technology and our belief in technology are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explanation of further things revealed will go too much detail, so I will withhold (as the guidelines for writing a comment). Btw, by "revealed" I mean that we cut through our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Storyline: How does Neo and the last movie movie end up to the beginning of the next? In short, they keep the faith, and use and abuse too much stylized action and timing, as it goes out of style (and after this show I hope movie-goers and makers learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a little more). More about this later. To spoil nothing, I will say no more than the promotional material that has already been done: Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he looks for answers as he tries to save the people and Zion while all the bad things are behind him. go and its cohorts. The movie goes pretty much, where the last one has. <br /> <br /> Action: While martial arts action and gunplay have squeezed its predecessor into somewhat equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than weaponry, adds swords, sais, and so on. to the mixture. Special effects are used so often and blow in the audience's face that it becomes really tiring. I discussed this movie with friends and colleagues, and almost everyone got the action sequences - especially the "Smith fight" we all heard would be in the movie - too long and boring. This is a big red flag for action fans, because the end of an action figure should also leave you a little bit more, or completely satisfied with the cruelty that just happened. <br /> <br /> These fighting scenes don't. They are over-styled, over-the-top rows that are wood and uninspired. In the first movie there was a real sense of despair for some of the action, a feeling that the struggle for survival was not just good (which I honestly think they are not reloading anyway) in a black and learning. Check out Drunken Master or Iron Monkey for this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting ranges there are - you won't regret it. In addition, the "Matrix capabilities" of people in Reloaded are not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first film had its inconsistencies here, but they weren't too scary - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are thrown out and on and on. Every little thing someone does is just jump, somersault, turn, and in many cases just mail, is slow-paced, bullet-timed, or overstated by some destruction. Clearly, the W Bros had a lot of money to throw at this movie, and the boy threw them, with no real restraint. Sharp editors really helped it, but the first movie was such a hit that the free government was taken for granted, which resulted in us. . . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have more or less said that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can't really bring much depth to their character as the writing and direction chase the face of the predecessor of the character profession or completely neglect it. The audience is not given nuances and substance at any time, so they can consider the character on their own. <br /> <br /> Keanu's acting performance is at best tight. Keanu is good at confusing, and it's about everything he does in this movie. He made a decent effort to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it fell flat. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V, and gets as cool as a cat throughout. With the writing he provided, he made a noble effort, but it also fell flat. <br /> <br /> Moss is also not very credible. Her rise is always the same, just like Keanu's, and the chemistry is not there, but in their physical scene they fall well enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo again brought his strange feeling of being. An agent program, but he also suffered from the script. In fact, I find him the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a big, provoked battle scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is disappointing if you've had good expectations, and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (it's not how it's supposed to be), it's still terrible. I do not see the Matrix so deeply, but at least I consider it a pleasant scifi skirt, which has some interesting ideas, good action, some funny lines, and enough symbolism and confusion to encourage attention . Reloaded fails on all of these points, and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better 3rd installment experience. Granted, I don't have much hope for that.
