Ron Howard corrected it? The 1966 cartoon is beautiful and teaches a simple lesson to children who use a simple plot. In this movie Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I think the author imagined the nastiest person, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Like Danny Devito's penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so rude that any degree of comedy exploited by his character just evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon contains a Grinch that we can all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, rare old man we've all seen at one time or another in a parked car that mumbled himself or with toddlers sat at the supermarket. she rode. This Grinch has been thoroughly robbed of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his salvation at the end of the film is false. The whole movie is fake: there is a dull Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt to explain why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood and an indifferent riddle about why some of the Whos are that strange lip extension and some have. of them do not. Unlike the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine that children will find this movie tiring, annoying and filled with conflicting messages. Do we really need to see Slutty Smurf, also Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his undoubted relatives. Throw the necessary blunt jokes, jokes, sex jokes and other compulsory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie so far from the 1966 cartoon (or book it inspired) as George W Bush is rational, clear thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
