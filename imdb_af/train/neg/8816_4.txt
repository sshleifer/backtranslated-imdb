I saw Mom. Well, she didn't sank exactly Santa Claus; He kept his hand on her hip and evil thoughts. <br /> <br /> It was enough to have an emotional scar for a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up as a bitter man who was upset about the quality of the toys made and the lack of Christmas. <br /> <br /> The expectation of a true treasure trove was very disappointed that fewer than a handful of people died and there was no nudity. What a bummer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to keep this movie, but it was just too slow and didn't really have a good writing. I didn't expect big acting, but I certainly wanted an action. There just wasn't any.
