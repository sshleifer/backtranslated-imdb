I saw very much in my day, but good, Hot Rod takes the cake. The other night I saw a free show in NY. I can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers. The big laugh was sparse, the plot was uninteresting and the characters were at best one dimensional. A highlight is a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and was the only scene where I really laughed. Other than that, I can only remember randomness and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I expected more. But it's short, I definitely won't recommend to attend a free screen or pay to watch this movie.
