A man brings his new wife to his home when his former wife died of an accident. His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich! Suddenly she heard sounds and saw skulls all over the place. Will she go crazy again or is the first woman back from death? <br /> <br /> You've probably guessed the end, so I won't spell it. I saw it many times as a child on Saturday afternoon. Then I liked it, but I was young. If I see it now, I realize how bad it is. It's been terrifying, poorly written, very boring (even at an hour) and has a huge role to play in FIVE people (one is the director)! Yet it does have good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is scarce and the area with the large empty house and the dam nearby is nice atmospheres. There are also a few scary moments (I jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective end. All in all, it's definitely NOT a good movie, but not a total disaster. It does have a small cult. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-in edition (this is linked to "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It's in frightening form with leaps and scrapes everywhere. It didn't even look so bad on television!
