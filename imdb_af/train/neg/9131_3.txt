I can hardly believe that I watched after more than 25 years. <br /> <br /> A few times I watched 6 Fu movies in a row ... Boris Karloff, and all 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 reading, both directed (and I use the word rather) by Jess Franco, was horrific. At that point I skipped this one and remembered that it was even TRUE in some ways. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it. Never again. You know what's worse than a horrible movie? A very well made piece of S ***. And that's what FIENDISH PLOT is. It's a very good movie. GREAT production design, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good site, a decent acting ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, one of the WORST SCRIPTURES in film history !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so misleading ... one can miss it for a decent movie. And then they start singing "Happy birthday to Fu" ... and it goes downhill. With Burt Kwouk (whose master says, "Your face is known.") Fu's elixir vitae accidentally fills out a fire, meaning he is condemned to torture, bury and one of his ears cutting off was the closest thing to funny what they had. It was as if someone had decided they wanted to make a "campy" movie - so ridiculous that it would be funny. RIDICULOUS, that's ... FUNNY ... it's not. Absolutely. <br /> <br /> It's sad because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone has done a lot of research on the Fu Manchu series to get it right. With another script - either a very fine or a dead, serious one, they might have had - had to have a classic on their hands. A movie that one could make, forgot about the horror of those Jess Franco atrocities ... instead of digging them as masterpieces. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 70's when a whole series of classic 30's characters were revived in films that were universally terrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure this one might be the worst of the lot. It had good self-control not to progress all over it, especially any scene containing Sid Caesar (FBI head who was also Al Capone's cousin - you see what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the movie aren't funny ... they often make SENSE SENSE. Like when their "audition" police personalize the King and Queen, and we find the people's "audition" dance hall routines such as singing, dancing and unicycle driving. How many drugs did the writers of this thing need to make sense to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame ... and a real waste of all that talent, including those of Peter Sellers (who both played Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk A Chris Lee Fu movie in his time, Helen Mirren (the policewoman who falls in love with the villain and the damn, stuck off the film for the last half hour!). I wonder if someone will ever make a "proper" Fu Manchu movie, or if fans will have to fix for Karloff's almost the only one?
