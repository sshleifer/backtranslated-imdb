I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant cast of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") couldn't save this worthless piece of garbage. This film should serve as a lesson for all past, present and future filmmakers. If you have a movie as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders", you should probably leave sleeping dogs and you should definitely not try to revive them. more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial support to get a better successor like Herschel Gordon Lewis with "Blood Feast 2: All You Can Eat"). Even if you decide to do so, you probably have to spend a little more money than you did on the original and for the sake of God ... NEVER have a movie on video ... why do filmmakers do it even to do this if everyone knows that quality will stick out ... I personally have another movie made in this way, even the powder is worth blowing it to hell ... if you can't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original movie, then sell the rights of the movie to someone who can ... and what did Ted V Mikels think about (or smoke) when he wrote this god wful script? I mean come on, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine that can grind human bodies ... legs and clothes and all? If any of these actors, apart from Liz Renay, are paid more than five dollars for their spectacular performances than they are overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and rather look at the original.
