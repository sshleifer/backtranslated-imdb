Here's why the Jane Show won't work. Again, Canadian bottle producers and writers cannot create a sitcom without placing a different kind of spin on it. I think these people don't look very much at T.V. from the US who patched the sitcom model down. No, here we have to do something else, we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make it. The characters are two-dimensional and the story lines are over: Forklift races ??? Give me terrible breaks. Here's some advice for the authors of the show, don't write funny situations, find the funny in situations. And remember, you should be born with a sense of humor to really write funny things, not just an improv monkey.
