I have never heard of this movie because it played as part of a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Nearly 60 years on the list was nice to say the least with seven names - in addition to the top-billed Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not long from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and probably even better known as the daughter of Theater Set Designer Norman, Walter Brennan, who needs no introduction, Frank Faylen, the sadistic male nurse in The Lost Weekend. the much nicer little town in It is a wonderful life, Robert Preston another decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter making up the numbers. Oh, most of them wasted their time. I looked in vain for any 'signature' scenes, as it was Robert Wise on bullhorn. By now he made about half a dozen movies and still got a style. The story is our old friend's series war and Mitchum had thought it was hardly a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy oaths on which he cut his teeth. There's no new twist - if you don't count the incredible scene, then Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping in Thaxter to get information about her father's plans to move his cattle. This is quite true, but how did Mitchum know? We didn't see or hear anything to show how he discovered it. On balance there is not much to say for this.
