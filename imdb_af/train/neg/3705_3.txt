I love Chris Rock, but I feel that he has been wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​waiting for Heaven is good, but the filmmakers have followed the plan of that turkey. When Eddie Murphy repeated Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he did them all over again - so they became Murphy movies, not just clumsy remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris did the same, it could have been a much better movie. The few believers coming are when he does his warm-up routine - so he can also do a concert movie. It would also have been very funny if the white man whose body he inhabited was a truck driver or a mountain plane. So why is Hollywood so messed up? Because people are going to see it - because they love Chris Rock. So Chris gives a decent script and gives us better movies! First of all, don't try out movies that weren't so good!
