I love sharks. And mutant. And explosions. Theoretically, with the parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> That's not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain of Power Rangers, and has about the same size of rubbery movement. It may be good if the makers were not quite as proud of the design as it seems. That is, for a man in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror movie that benefits from some puzzles, the shark gets lots of screen time. Granted, it's usually shaky and erratic. I think you should assume it's so frightening that even the camera's guy comes out. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to someone to eat, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to the person to eat, just now shouting and armless. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costume is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen quite randomly so more people can be eaten or exploded. Because let me tell you, the people who made this movie definitely went with more explosions = better attitude. Characters shoot cars and there's a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there's a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHAT they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end. <br /> <br /> What I don't care about how crazy one is, I find It is hard to believe that anyone would think of trying to make a huge half-shark, having sex with " a woman to make freaky shark people's babies is a good idea. This is unless that person is the crazy scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and sometimes, boring) that even its bad isn't really enough for a person's long-standing interest. It may be good with MST3K with your friends, but beyond that, if you see this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
