It is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest stinkers of all time (certainly the greatest stinker of director Brian De Palma's career). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a rich, rich boy whose life goes down. when he and his lover, Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), are involved in a hit career. His story is written by another liar, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary. <br /> <br /> What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly doesn't add much. It is undermined by unbelievably cruel, one-dimensional characters who you never want the discontent of real life encounter. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I read it once, but couldn't complete it because it wasn't for me), but it goes without saying that those who did / enjoyed the novel regarded this film as a complete transvesty. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many talented actors striving to give a below average movie of quality and failure. What a waste. <br /> <br /> The trouble begins with throwing good man Tom Hanks into a role that is clearly supposed to be careless. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Briton. Bruce Willis is bad, BADLY miscast in the role. What was the thinking there. <br /> <br /> Oh, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity, and is obliged to deliver a lame, heavy-handed lecture on "decency" to the climax. /> <br /> This movie ends in an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I like the compilation of talent; because it will give me four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a much better movie from the source material could be made.
