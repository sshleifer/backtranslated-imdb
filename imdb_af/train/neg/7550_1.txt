OK, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan and I don't usually like British movies that have been recreated by Americans. So why, why did I ever put myself through the most painful theater experiences? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had a moment of madness? The movie was terrible! The little bit at the start of the accident / fire had nothing to do with the movie and the female police knew where Edward was going, so the little end up with the two girls visiting the continent, well, that wouldn't did not The whole thing would be investigated. The history behind the toes was not really investigated - and I think it's set in America, didn't really help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and contains no atmosphere or tension. I must say that the best thing was right at the end when Nicolas Cage flared up! I am so urgently needed to see the original again, to clean up my disappointed soul. I really can't stress how disappointing this movie is, please don't see it if you: <br /> <br /> A) Not like American inhibitors of British movies. B) Is a fan of the original C) Hate Nicolas Cage
