which eventually kills this movie is its self-awareness. here is a shortlist: 1. irreverent behavior. When the chicks remained and injected their mark of "strange, irreverent" behavior / humor, it was greeted so freshly. It was more than 4 decades ago. Come on. <br /> <br /> 2. False sophistication. spit base, quasi-socio-political isms are hard to make work comics. ask woody everyone. <br /> <br /> 3. The post-modern "I am difficult in this ominous world and yes, I recognize it in myself." Snake eats itself - used as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - is such a repetition. <br /> <br /> 4. Smarmy, alley drollness. <br /> <br /> 5. Amateur writing, acting, direction ... ever seen student films? Being a victim of himself, the only thing I can say positively is that it has at least a feeling of itself, and now, I get caught up in the self-reflective thing it sees worth while. br /> <br /> but after ... what? finally it's just as hollow as any other pretentious piece, ever see Woody Allen's mountain man, "Interiors" ??? Well, it just does it amateur.
