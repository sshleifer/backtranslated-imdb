Since John Doe apparently inspired Kyle XY's creator, I expected his pilot to be very interesting. However, I had too high expectations because I was disappointed with it. First, they have the protagonist in a freak who had the crazy idea of ​​pointing out his wonderful knowledge to an audience in a public area. So after that scene I started worrying that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it gets worse as none of the other characters have been properly introduced. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story less interesting. I was also slightly disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance because I found he didn't make a credible John Doe. Another problem was the police story. It really felt like dear and it wasn't a pleasant sensation. This leads us to the worst problem in the bunch, the episodic format. I could see the fillers coming one after the other. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very disappointed and didn't recommend it. Considering how bad it was, I now better understand why the show was canceled. Somehow, I have the impression that it has missed its target, developed characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The quality of the production was also quite good and the casting was correct. But I'll never know if it's got better, probably not, because I'm not planning to watch the next episode.
