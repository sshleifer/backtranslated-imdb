This series just gets worse and worse. Poorly written and simply not funny! The point of departure is excellent, but the author's inexperience is evident. By trying so hard to offend nobody, they insult everyone. Now in the second season, the desperate shooting stopped blowing their arms, and dedicated to the patronizing, smug, "Oh dumb you" style actor who came with no laughter. They roll their eyes and shake their heads together, as if to say, aren't we zany? Isn't it funny? Well, no, it's not really. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, except for Corner Gas, avoid Canadian general Canadian TV. Come on CBC you're supposed to be our leading station showing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
