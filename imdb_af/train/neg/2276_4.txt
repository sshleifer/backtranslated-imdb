CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, classmates of the West Point Academy were torn apart from the outbreak of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> Gregory Hoblit's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - clear men are blindfolded by conflict - although production looks a bit stilted, despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), conducted by Dan Futterman as a South African conscienceist, taking up arms in defense of slavery and in direct conflict with his former North friends. The film's emphasis on such a wrong but sympathetic character is especially brave, but the drama is differently flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is more effective than inspired.
