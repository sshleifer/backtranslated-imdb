SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> Fifteen-year-old bad girl Melissa is new to a desert town and it is not long before people start to die around her. The detective has to bring the clues with the help of his good girl, Nancy Drew, who played the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell on Friday. The local indigenous Americans are the main suspects, as they seem to be the prejudice of the people. These events all lead to the revealing of the murderer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. <br /> <br /> This subordinate treasure is not too memorable. It has a TV feel, without much counting, apart from the title character's own stingy theme song that plays several times throughout. Lines like "the killer will change us into collec- tive slavery." Fits into standard eighty screens. Marci calls Melissa a bad name, and somehow they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how difficult it is to fit in, because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This movie would be difficult to make today with the main character being fifteen and the director adds several free-form close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians is not sufficiently developed to be taken seriously. I'm surprised by the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that celebrated birthday party tradition to create an intense series of massacres, but I don't feel like delivering. But on the bright side, the release of obscure movies like this one on DVD hopes others will follow.
