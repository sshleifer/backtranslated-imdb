To be a fan of the manga and anime of Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I looked forward to this one. I didn't see the manga or the anime, so I had no preconceptions. Good thing too. What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the kind that arrived early in the evening with complete regularity on cable channels. Although it is tame in comparison to the germs of regular cable viewers, the naughty bits of our hero are tastefully hidden behind a strategically glued scarf or with ridiculous sunburn effect. There are long-lasting scenes of slavery and torture that justify the proceedings just enough to make them unfit for the children. While I have nothing against naked female heroes, I don't like amateur movies (at least four in this series). On the positive side, in each of the four episodes I've seen, at least one beautifully beautiful actress. It's no wonder Nagai's TESTICLE BOY never made it ...
