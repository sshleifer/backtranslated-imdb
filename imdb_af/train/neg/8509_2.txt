I saw this movie for a number of reasons, mainly Mira Sorvino. With her on the throw it couldn't be that bad. And it even looked like it had a little secret and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good at 'Unreliable'. The story is in Spain, so it can be an exotic, entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you think of the same thing, let me warn you: this is a really terrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that is headed is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is budgeted with subplots that add nothing to the story. They are trying to build a treasury / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but they fail terribly. The twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation nowhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin! I didn't care about anyone. More than that, they are annoying and hateful people. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible. Mira, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You're an Oscar winner! Have some dignity! Her character was weak, but it is no excuse for such a terrible performance. She seems to be sleeping all the movie long. Come to think of it, I actually think I saw her eyes slowly in some scenes. I thought this woman is sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at a skin, Romi and Michelle try because there's nothing to see here. And that accent? My god ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even the worst. It's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. I'm sorry, but I can't. Ive suffered enough with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressed! It's so bad in every way, it's a wonder how it's even made. A suspicious team to write a loop and make money about the actor's name. Don't fall for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
