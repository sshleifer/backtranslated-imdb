Unlike USA's two other current game shows (Deal Or No Deal and 1 at 100), the pace of this show is far too slow for what happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away at a slow pace because the games can change or end at any time. There is risk involved in every action the player takes, the rewards are very variable and it is difficult for the players to leave with a considerable amount of money. Suspension is usually well used. <br /> <br /> Show me The money, on the other hand, is just too slow. When a question is revealed and it is clear that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that nothing will happen in the next few minutes. This will help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and then the player has chosen a dancer, instead of Shat wasting time to talk about what will happen if the player gets a wrong answer is if we all know they are right. The random dance is stuffing that actually feels like stuffing. Too much time is wasted while there is not enough ... and the fact that players cannot choose to leave the game early ensures a lot of time is lost. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have NO interest in watching Shat shake his groove, especially right after eating dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm a lifelong game show fan, but even I had a lot of trouble going there for an hour. It also needs major changes or early retirement.
