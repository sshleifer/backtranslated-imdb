Kevin Spacey is very talented, but sadly director is not his fort. I had high expectations about the movie before renting it and maybe that's why I didn't like it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that mostly takes place in one small environment, but that's not the effort that counts. I found the film dull, boring and stretched. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise did much better, especially since he is aware of most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but it was one of his first films (I got a kick of how young and chubby this Scream star watched). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved along the line and past the wreck. But that shot was very "Ordinary Suspicious", and my guess is that Spacey got the idea from the previous movie of her (it's very good for you). If you want to see a fantastic movie happening in one small area, watch Hitchcock's lifeboat. Maybe Spacey had to watch it before it was filmed.
