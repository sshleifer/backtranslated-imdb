Yikes. It's pretty bad. The play is not nice to start with, and the decision to post it to film does not make it beneficial - especially since Peploe does not decide how to handle the theater-related origin of the material (we sometimes get a glimpse of an acting theater audience etc.) and decided to go with a jumping editing style aimed at reminding you to watch a movie, while actually reminding you that you are watching a very poor movie a director who is overwhelmed by her material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is breathtakingly poor: stage-y and plume, it's as if she's playing the role via Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Only Fiona Shaw gives a show of notes - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means she can handle the material best - but it is difficult to watch a movie for one performance alone, even if that performance is so light , truth and quite like Shaw's. Ben Kingsley turns into an average and disconnected spin, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays her supporting role as just that. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic rubbed off on his wife if this film were to testify.
