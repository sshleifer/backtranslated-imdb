it is without a doubt the worst idiotic thing I ever watched. <br /> <br /> This movie plot is that an old man got mad and dressed like a Santa and killed people because he saw his mother giving his dad oral sex while dressed as santa clause. THIS IS WHY HE HAS INCORPORATED INSANE? is it just me or is it the worst damn reason why someone like to ever walk? And that's not the only thing. I'm serious when I say nothing happens in this DAMN MOVIE. nothing up to 1 hour and 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a whole friggin scene where he captures a friggin santa beard. THIS IS A FRIGGIN MINUTE LONG. WHO WANTS TO SEE? but I have to say the end of this movie scratched me to laugh at it. so if you see this movie on TV or come back like 1 hour and 20 minutes to see only the worst end in the whole movie history and I'm serious about it. <br /> <br /> It's not so good its bad, it's boring, it's idiot, it makes me want to break the vkr. it's just not worth your time, I'm sure every other review mentioned it, but the actress who played the mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second. YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD IS THIS MOVIE? I have a better home improvement for sixty-six hours, and even watch these movies.
