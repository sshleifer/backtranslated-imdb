I think I should start by saying that almost any style of work can entertain in parts. The real test is whether it is good from start to finish, and that is why I gave the analytical title for this review. Most of us will agree - even those like me, who like to read many blogs - that blogs can't compare to good novel writing for good reason. Similarly, FEM cannot compare with good filmmaking for a number of reasons, and I actually believe it is a poor example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a cut-throat vlog. (Heck, even MySpace gets some pimping.) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 - I didn't - I watched it. FEM, while definitely grinder than the bubble gum atmosphere of the mentioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. It's like looking at the tenacity of life, which I think most will agree, is, of course, boring. And yet the creators of FEM would like to welcome them, their very postmodern film about making a movie. Give me a gift. <br /> <br /> Eventually I get away and don't mind the least. I'm shocked that I'm actually interested in taking the time to write this review, even. It's not that FEM is bad, because it's not; It has a few moments where I crack a smile or think maybe - just maybe - something of interest will happen. Rather it is just straight. Medium. I feel so careless that it is almost fitting for an oxymoron: passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope the creators / actors in the movie go out of their way. They will probably need it when one of them moves out and lives. <br /> <br /> See this movie if you have time to waste and nothing you want to do; Otherwise, pass it by, and don't worry about missing a great, undiscovered talent. You really don't.
