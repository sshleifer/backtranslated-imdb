This anime series starts well: Interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is explained immediately, while a proverbial root is being pushed in front of the viewer and the viewer is granted to watch each subsequent episode. However, imagine the disappointment of finding that the sci-fi thriller / giant robot adventure is just a backdrop to psychobab and quasi-religious preaching exploitation. If you want to hear, "You're good. It's good to be you." After talking to negative slogans and the characters' negative emotions, it is for you. If you want a good sci-fi movie, it's just nice to watch, forget about this one. Both the original and the alternative ends were very disappointing to me. All that and this movie was too preachy.
