With a title like this, you don't expect a big horror movie. But it was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal carries a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. this joke can really work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not throughout the movie! The actors are not that bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is dull and straight stupid. No tension, no excitement and little things (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically. It became so boring to the end when I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't care what happened. Amanda Plummer was wonderful in Pulp Fiction, but come on. It was 13 years ago and she didn't do anything decent after that. So it's no wonder she had to sink as low as this piece. Avoid or be warned.
