Imagine it says 12 o'clock - your home, bored, tired of you. This scenario happened, for example, 4 or so years ago. I switched on the TV and flipped over a few channels and found that this movie was on. OH MY WORD this is the worst movie I've ever seen! A runaway car that can't be stopped (although the brakes are cut or something), you can put it in the freeway - what's going to happen? This movie was so bad it was actually funny. I think the stunts cost about $ 2 to make. There was one case where a baby / small child with a helicopter was towed out of the car - in an attempt to raise the viewer - a convenient place to bridge is approaching ... THIS IS THE BEST BATH BIT OF A MOVIE. It shows the child misses the bridge, but it looks so bad. You can almost see the dummy they used - total low budget classic! Can't remember the end of the movie, but I bet it's BIG. <br /> <br /> I doubt they will ever show this movie again, so I'm glad I saw this piece of trash!
