Nell Shipman has been looking for a plot to make a chase in "Back to God's Country" of the previous year, and she failed. This time she does better, though it looks senseless. 'Something new' hardly has a plot outside the chase. There is a short performance set up by the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it is nothing more than an exciting, indisputable chase from there. Of course, it plays like an hour-long advertisement for a Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is jokingly ridiculous. She doesn't seem to have learned much about D.W.'s last minute rescue movies. Griffith or his parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she imitates. <br /> <br /> One point of interest is that Shipman writes herself in the film as the author of the film's story, which as lead actor is a writer (Shipman again), though she doesn't do much or otherwise with humor not, though she tries. Again, others have the pioneers of the author's joke in the subtitles, such as Anita Loos, with 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion with a girl's folly '(both 1917). At least Shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously - and neither does I. "Something new", despite his claim, is hacked.
