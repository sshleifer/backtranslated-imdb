The movie has several story lines that follow different characters. The different story lines do not feel like a whole full piece that makes this comedy a very incoherent one and even becomes annoying to watch at times. <br /> <br /> It may sound poor and clich√©, but it is true; You're better off watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie. I'm sure both the movie and the crew had a lot of fun making this movie, but the movie didn't give the viewers much fun. For a comedy it just isn't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin are just not good actors, even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make a whole movie and their feelings are long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying. The film has quite a potential, I think Steve Irwin is one character It is in a strange way both interesting and hilarious to watch, so when I first heard that they made a movie about "the crocodile hunter", was my first reaction; brilliant! However, the film suffers from its bad story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfriendly characters. The movie does have a certain entertainment value, at least enough to see this movie at least once, but still, I definitely shouldn't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie feel like a waste of time. Yet this movie can only be seen once when it comes to TV on a rainy afternoon. It does have some good moments, but the story lines ruin the film and its potential completely. <br /> <br /> 4/10
