Oh, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I must honestly say I was totally disappointed by this whole series ("Never Never Dies", "Mermaid in a Manhole" and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" are the exceptions ... and even that is not good ...), but "Devil's Experiment" is just plain bladder. There is nothing realistic about this, except the climax (or perhaps anti-climaxes, depending on how you see it) eye-catching scene. The victim does not really care what goes on and hardly dares or shrinks while being subjected to "terrible" (more often sometimes "hilarious") tortures. "Flower of Meat and Blood" is a more violent and greedy depiction of false sniffing material, but the film also falls flat on reality. I am delighted by the Japanese pushing the boundaries, and they have really come a long way over the past two decades to carry the crown into an extreme movie, but 'Devil's Experiment' just doesn't stop. A look is a bit difficult, but for no reason other than seeing what the fuss is about, but I can only give this movie a generous 3/10 and it's just for the needle-by-the-door. eye scene ...
