Tasteless. I can't even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed at the whole movie. It wasn't supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he is doing. His story was written, it seems, without any knowledge of the Iowa culture and the meth problem. I know Farnsworth comes from Iowa, which makes his movie even more mysterious. Why did the two main characters accent? It does not make sense. The acting was at best mediocre and sometimes difficult to watch. Good violence and sex filled the movie. I guess the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy, but it was incredible and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the role credits with unbelief. As I walked out of the theater, everyone left was laughing with me. The end of the movie was meant to eradicate tears, but it did exactly the opposite. Don't waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant, juicy, in vain, clich√©d.
