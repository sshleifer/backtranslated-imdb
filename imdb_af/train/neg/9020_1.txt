I woke up and watched this thing last night. The only thing I can say well about this horrible movie is that it can be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they are characters. Setups were hokey and inane, and over-exploitation of split screens was wasted because they couldn't synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give it a zero or a minus rating, I'd like to do it. Unfortunately, it's not even the time for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time thinking about it.
