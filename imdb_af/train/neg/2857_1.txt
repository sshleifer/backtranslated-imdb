Since then, I've been starting to look at them back in 2002 (my first one was Sabretooth - which is actually one of the more entertaining Sci-Fi channel features). Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are laughable, and then some are really awful. Raptor Planet lies in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a stand-alone sequel to the original Raptor Island Sci-Fi Channel 2004, is a scarcely watchful movie rubbish with truly horrific acting and lazy writing. The effects that the dinosaurs bring to life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as CGI and stock footage of Raptor Planet) are some of the worst viewing effects I have seen in a low-budget movie. The gore effects are even inconclusive. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a lot of commandos that for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. It's right people, the dinosaurs are strangers. Dinosaurs in outer space. What are the next sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. The human being is counted and eaten. By now, we've been expecting it in the many dinosaurs' movies and novels that were released, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I saw where I actually got bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br There are some chuckles in it though. There is one scene protruding in which a man is smuggled by a Carnotaur (made alive by stockpile from the original film) which later becomes a giant raptor. Also, a little trivia, it's the scene where Steven Baur shoots from his first movie on his own death scene. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island wasn't a good movie to start with, it's a masterpiece compared to the sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me if I say, it's probably the worst movie Syfy ever broadcast. It is inaccurately close.
