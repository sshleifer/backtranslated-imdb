Again, a sub-standard episode of season is one. It is about the subject of reincarnation and not just flying. I have never been big on reincarnation and it can be part of my apathy to this episode. This refers to the Tooms case, which is some good continuation of the previous episode. But the positive ends there. This is unfortunate because it occurs at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead guy would prefer to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And he waits for the girl to take revenge. There is even a serious lack of spectacular Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode up to date. If you are in reincarnation, this episode may have increased in you. If you are not, then you can at least learn what bradycardia is.
