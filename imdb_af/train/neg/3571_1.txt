The super sexy B movie actress still shares a bit as the future "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialogue, well, one WORD of dialogue. She shouts out of "Joe!" as Ray's character breaks the poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose nozzle. This movie is so bad, though sometimes funny, hilaries. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love it! Look at the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the stocking-editing and effects they do to try to show how bad Pia's character is. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenplay writer in this. Pia Zadora as writer writer? Yes, right. Pia can barely speak, let alone write! Pia is completely and absolutely wrong in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her little part in this cat's opinion! Rock on Glory!
