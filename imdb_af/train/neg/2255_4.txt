Was this movie stupid? Yup. Has this film depth? Nope. Character development? Nope. Plot turn? Nope. It was just a movie about a highly fictional Springer show. It shows the lengths some people will go to get their cups on TV. Molly Hagan did a good job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is .... well ... GREAT! This movie was not made to be a breakthrough movie, rather, it was meant to live in a trailer (I live in a trailer and we are nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone with All sleep differently all the girls are pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive rusted '66 Ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees if you called a trailer). Some people analyze movies (case-in-point: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies purely for the entertainment value; Not to point out that the girl is wearing another shirt in another scene (read the "Goofs" bit about Connie's shirt.) Was it better?
