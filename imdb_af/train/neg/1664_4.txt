This movie is enough to entertain because of an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is beautiful. The reason why the film is so predictable is that we've seen it before. I didn't read the book A Mother's Gift, but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears that it's totally different from that movie. Unless you're thinking of ending a movie with what is essentially a music video, it's an original idea.
