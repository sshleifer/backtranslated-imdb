Not much to say about this one. A plot that you can pen very well in the first 10 minutes. Nothing too wrong with this movie, very little action for an action movie. There was a chance to occasionally explore the characters' emotions. Whether an action movie is the right genre to do it, I haven't decided yet. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without giving full attention, as it had small twists and a simple plot. I was probably guilty of it, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it might be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but best of my 4 out of 10's)
