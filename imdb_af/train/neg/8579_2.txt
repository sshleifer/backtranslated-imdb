I'm afraid this one is pretty scary, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. This is a first and last attempt by writer-director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's program to promote home-made films. While the program is worth stimulating efforts like the New Waterford Girl, it opens the door to unimproved beginners like Lyu who should not aggressively launch this project, but were green without proper investigation of her script or her credentials . <br /> <br /> You don't care about the low budget, because the bad production design, bad lighting, poor sound, and urgent documentary shooting choices are in line with the subject. The workers in Canadian massage rooms. But the dialogue and the plot do not give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any spiritual challenge other than the suspension of unbelief. When your story is this simplistic, the last thing you need is a darkened storytelling technique; Although nothing happens, the movie is difficult to follow and the point of view is impossible to attach. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several notches under his similar characterization in "Exotica". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard, peculiar airhead; As always, she is nice, but here she is a little different. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels her excellent performance in the "New Waterford Girl". Her flat performance in "Rub and Tug" should limit any tendency to search other movies in which she appeared; unless you need further confirmation from Alan Moyle's director of Waterford to work with young actors. <br /> <br /> You soon come to the conclusion that Lyu's reptile brain cannot grasp concepts such as plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and crippled "deus ex machina" device at the end is almost a surprise. Still, it may be worse, the lackluster story has in any case so little internal logic that the unlikely end is not as painful as would normally be the case. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
