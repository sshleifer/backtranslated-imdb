"The Sieger" was strongly recommended to be one of the few good action movies in Germany. I watched it last night and I have to admit that I am very disappointed. If it is supposed to be "the last best hope" for the entertaining and challenging German action theater, then there is not much left. <br /> <br /> "The Sieger" is trying to be sexy, daring and furious, but it's nothing like that. The characters are wood and stereotype and when they do something unexpected (which doesn't happen too much), the act is against their nature. This makes it difficult for me to follow or even identify with them. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I think the movie was pretty bad. There is not one character in whom I believe. Perhaps the superior officer is at the SWAT unit - but that's about it. Those who try to look or act like special units, such as elite police - I don't believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that bad. But I think it's badly said. You don't know the bad guy - for example. And when he asked a "very dark" show, Karl Simon (the good guy), he had all his dead opponent "why?" What for? I myself asked the same question to know that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe Germany can do better, even with action movies.
