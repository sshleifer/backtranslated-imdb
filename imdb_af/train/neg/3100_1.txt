Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This movie gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst movie ever made. This one is nice to laugh at, as Manos was just painful to watch. Hobboblins will end up somewhere in a time capsule as the perfect movie to describe the term "80's cheeze". The acting (and I use these terms rather) is horrible, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst dolls you'll ever see, and the garden tools should be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and the version is the only way to see this mess. This movie gives Mike and the clash a lot of ammo to draw some of the funniest one-liners they ever did. If you try to see it without the help of Mike and the clash ..... God helps you !!
