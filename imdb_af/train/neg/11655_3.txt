I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought Scary Movie, though not a good movie, was very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times simply silly. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Now, I will admit that I have a downside, since I have not seen some of the movies that these parodies had in contrast to the first, where I basically saw them. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing that destroyed some of the good jokes. Scenes and jokes stretch out to the long time. <br /> <br /> The same jokes are also repeated again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it is still being repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was initially amusing, but it still repeated and eventually became stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes even repeated from the first movie. For example, the "creaming" I think you will call it Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had been holding her boyfriend sex so long that he actually had blue balls from hell and this was funny when he smeared her. But this time it wasn't right and not funny. <br /> <br /> In general, the bathroom and sexual humor were more amusing and tackled for the first time. The scat humor was excessive and rather unnecessary in the second movie. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and didn't really have a place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who, in my opinion, was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites of the second film. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . They have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.
