Visually interesting, but falling flat into the originality department. This tedious exercise in technique wears thin to the opening struggle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains the worst dialogue I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the writing is so poor that it keeps you out of the movie, and I thought about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream bluescreen. Paltrow is as woody as they get. It can be saved through a snappy movie noir dialogue or over the top camp. My only complaint about the technique is that Black & White movie (sorry, computer) will be helped because it looks like Turner colored black and white. Just a big dull clich√© mess. I'd rather break my femur than go through this endurance again.
