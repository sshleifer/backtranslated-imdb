Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, no mistake. But it's also an incredibly pleasant one. This is largely due to the immense presence of one Chuck Connors, which is regarded in the movie as the main, but really only in a few scenes. I suppose he should be similar to an Obi Wan Kenobi type ("The tricky ninja-buster", the shit), but his "wisdom" is laughing. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not of the highest concentration. <br /> <br /> But his two aides, Sonny and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that "Brooklyn," as we call the colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Pay special attention to Dennis's logic of the 'genetic splicing' of which Sakura is involved. If you know something about cloning, you will die. And yes, it's a great plot point, people. <br /> <br /> A terribly fun movie, Sakura Killers is a hard to find gem. I won't spoil the 'trick' that ends for you, except it's a perfect set for a Sakura Killers 2. Bad Chuck Connors died. :-( Because he does have the smoothest ways to blow ninjas away.
