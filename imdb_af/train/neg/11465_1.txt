This is without a doubt one of the worst photos I've ever paid money to see - the kind of movie you choose from despair at the mall theater during a Christmas holiday when you've missed the start times for anything good but still dead is a movie! And that's exactly how I got this stink bomb. <br /> <br /> At the distance of the better part of three decades, I can still smell the rotting fish that make up this storyline. Incredible plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual from the sea - is laughing. And it's about everything except for a completely out-of-place "love theme" that plays over the end of a movie without a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just throws the scenery up. He wasn't Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and it's not "Jaws". Graciously, I have most of it out of mind and when I distribute it on television, I immediately go on. "Danger, Robinson!" See the current t.v. commercial what a man and woman whale watching ("Orca - I love Orca ..."). It's over at least sixty seconds. This movie represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never return.
