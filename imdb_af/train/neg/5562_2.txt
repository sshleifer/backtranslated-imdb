This unpleasant film has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren gave a performance that was better than either this script or his other action films allowed. And there are occasional dialogues showing that the film might provide insight into a bizarre subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivations are either dark or thin. Most of the acting is sub-par. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the directors' unnecessary fascination with the focus on gore is distracting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
