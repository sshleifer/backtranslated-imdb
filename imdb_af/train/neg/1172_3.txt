Every time there comes a movie that drops me down and reminds me that my taste in movies I want to watch isn't always flawless. I would normally stay away from such things, but I was muted by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer family tree. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and intriguing novelty in the production where Rohmer is the actors mainly on painted (digital) backdrops of revolution era France. It is quickly shaken and becomes almost as interesting as drying the paint on a paint screen. What we left behind is a dull and thin film about aristocrats in the 18th century France. None of the characters are tempting or sympathetic. The pace is so confusing, the dialogue is so difficult, and tension is clearly a strange concept for Rohmer, that I eventually don't care who's rolled, who was who there, or what the devil had to go through. The movie would have benefited greatly from a little emotional build-up and a music party (there is fine classical music that is eventually used). Despite being "talky", the film plays much like a silent film, and the worst kind of movie, a dull and uninteresting film about infinite interesting subjects. Only the most clever French historians will find anything from this movie, as it seems to paint the familiar events of a new angle (the woman is English and a royal). Otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs, unless you suffer from insomnia (I have been extinguished twice).
