Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it is against everything that most vampire mites do. Like vampires walking in the sunlight. Although there are parts that just make you enjoy how society makes movies. A scene where a vampire is stabbed and screamed "Ow it hurts ... It's really stuck." Then there seems to be screens missing, but you get used to it after a while. And there are random dream sequences that really don't help with the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but I just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Think about it, the battle scenes were awesome, and the zombies were just nice to watch. Slowly as I write more of this, I like this movie more. But you know, you can't expect everything, but it's a fun watch.
