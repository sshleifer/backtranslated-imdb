In the 60s, with the background rehearsal and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar's Banquet" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones ?? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones? plus Marianne Getrou, Godard reveal other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements? the black power by the black panthers, feminism, communism, fascism - entwined with reading a cheap pulp political novel divided into chapters: "The Stones Rolling;" Outside Black Roman ";" Sight and Sound "; All About Eve"; "The Heart of the West"; "Inside the Black Sintax"; and "Under the Stones the Beach". <br /> <br /> "Sympathy for the devil" is another prosperous and boring mess of the Uneven director Jean-Luc Godard. The story and the footage are horrible, but luckily I love the Stones and "Sympathy for the Devil" and it's nice to see them in the beginning of their careers, otherwise this documentary would be unbearable. voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the devil"
