I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I manage to stay to the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I like jean hugues anglade, but I think he needs to eat like us, and so he accepted to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest can be called 'art' or something I couldn't express but I didn't understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've ever seen was accident, but I'm sure I have enough experience to look it up again. <br /> <br /> Congratulations !! ; O)
