What a wasted opportunity to really make an interesting movie about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration of what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep their art as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes, but they are really sex workers who play fantasies and sell private sessions where more than dance is offered. From the film one will get the impression that they are mainly calling on the women who go to the gay clubs and then rent the "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club just show women ahead of the stage and the "dancers" only play for the women in the audience. This is just not the reality of these clubs. It will be pretty difficult to do private dancing for straight women and couples. So, what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead, we get stuffing. A gay activist who doesn't add anything to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the dress, but gives no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. <br /> <br /> The photos of Mexico City are generic. The false fitting that makes hot dogs is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a completely simplified movie that would only be of interest to those who want to see some beautiful boy photos. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.
