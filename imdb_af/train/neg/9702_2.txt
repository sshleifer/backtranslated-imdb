I don't think this movie is rated correctly. I got my copy and blackened the PG rating and wrote R. I would not recommend it to anyone under 17 or 18, regardless of the R limit. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I don't know about you, but it is not something for small children to look at. It is probably the traditional "clothing style" of the African (?) Indians, but ... I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie recently, but I think otherwise, it was good.
