First, there is absolutely no flirting in this movie - with Anthony or anyone else. These people don't flirt - they just do it. Your first test of endurance is to risk more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. It won't be that bad. Hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without a context to insert it, it is repulsive. So you make it through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the movie turns into something else, different - no better - just different: a road photo without heart. There are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos - broadly written and widely played by broads such as Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and a few hookers and drag queens). They all earn better. Photography is deliberately disoriented, so if you get motion sickness (or really any kind of illness) - this movie is not for you. Come to think of it, I don't just know who this movie IS, except maybe gay and bi-sexual S&M fans who wrote poorly, poorly shot in movies about themselves.
