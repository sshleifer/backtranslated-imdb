Another The Hard straight to the video rip with cardboard villains ?? How much more of this god was cheap (and bad) deterred from the most popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s? For the record (not that you really care) this one is another blatant conclusion of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2, complete with a complete complement of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> The non-description villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut-out gun toting shooters sent in different ways as the film progresses, the hero is obviously an ex-cop or something that family and attitude issues and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage, but also a matching piece of candy and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The supposedly luxury cruise liner that runs between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry. ?? It's going somewhere to explain how to look on a rusty cross channel ferry? in New Zealand! The play is like wood like the deck, the male, the one predictable, the villains totally incompetent and the plot has holes in it that you can penetrate. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no end to this kind of rip off straight to video litter pollution from late night slots of television and DVD bargain bowls from supermarkets everywhere (although even this movie is so bad is it not yet to see a DVD release, but give it time!) Is there any chance that something will be made at least half, half credible and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I didn't think so.
