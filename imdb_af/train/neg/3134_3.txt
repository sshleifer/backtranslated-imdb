"The cases" fall under the wastage of the life (WOL) category. I'm sad that I'm now two hours older, am not entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and commented on the screen sobering and rooted for the mummy. I was sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie, otherwise it can be reduced to 25 minutes, so it can take a 30 minute lock on TV without any plot loss. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients, but when served it is not fragrant at all. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy had to have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing it with several people who want to deny the facts and want DNA samples of evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown on their ear by their colleges. Later on, everything was screwed by the evil people. The heroes will save the day and all prove wrong.
