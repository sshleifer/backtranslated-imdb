I honestly want to return the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person fit to watch this movie is Helen Keller. I told myself it had to get better, it had to get better. </ br> <br /> Then the zombies finally came up and they had a washcoat on their eyes. <br /> <br /> They spoke like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> One was driving a car. <br /> <br /> Some voodoo women have asked what one of the "Zombies" wanted and the "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (THIS was it) don't take anymore Can I sue about half an hour of my life ?????
