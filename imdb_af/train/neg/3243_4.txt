By far the most important requirement for any movie that follows trust tricks is that they can draw on us at least once, as well as their stupid words, the police, the crowd and (ideally) each other. But this film never pulls it off. Every scam can be seen, come down a mile (especially the piglets!) Too, they are not very interesting, complicated or sophisticated. Maybe Mammet hoped to compensate for this with complex dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are good, but they are delivered in such a stylized, unnatural, stylized way. I thought there might have been a clever point about us all the time ... but it wasn't. Regarding the psychological complexity, the main character is slightly suppressed and makes a little believing Freudian slips on her father. She thinks she's a whore, but she gets it over. I really liked the street scenes. Just look like an Edward Hopper painting.
