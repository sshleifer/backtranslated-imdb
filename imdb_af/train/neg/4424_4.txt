Uh Oh! Another gay movie. This time it shows the black side. Say your last dollar, it's going to have an unfortunate end! But why? With just under half a dozen exceptions, ALL gay movies should end in death or an "addio" final. It's like all the European Film Noir editions in the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's. The head ... man or woman must die or go alone in oblivion. Why should the authors, directors and producers in the name of the audience feel depressed? After all, it's supposed to be gay ... not shine. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' movie. A huge percentage of gay relationships last last and the couples ride together in the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he just shows off the gay life and gives the wrong impression of gay lifestyle. This movie does not prove my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here is another gay movie! That's wrong!
