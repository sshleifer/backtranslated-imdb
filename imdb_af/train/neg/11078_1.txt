frankly, where can i start! It was a low budget, HORRIBLY-activated movie, it was so cheesy that we all burst with laughter how completely delayed it! the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fighting, they played with some plastic swords they bought at walmart and all they were doing just groaned to make it look like they were struggling! My family and I were in the mood for a very good action day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there it was The Sawtooth Island movie. I mean it looks so good, but when we looked at it at home, I almost died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the plot of the movie, the storyboard, the script, etc. Was a bunch of garbage I didn't even know, why the director and producer even wasted their time making it !! But if you fall on this movie, don't get it !!!!!
