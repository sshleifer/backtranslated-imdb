My first exposure to the Templarios and not a good one. I was excited to find this title under the offers of Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other cult classrooms such as "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but it alone cannot hide the fact that the movie is deadly boring. There is an exciting opening sequence in which the villagers make a terrible revenge on the Templars (and move the whole thing), but everything in the movie is slow, overwhelming and ultimately unfinished. To add insult to injury: The movie is baptized, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.
