A group of people looking for strangers go to Earth to eat unhappily on a planet of prehistoric animals, instead of eating and delaying physical mushrooms. Filled with footage of "Planet of the Dinosuars" and horrible jokes, it's definitely one that misses. The play is also horrific, and while it's not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what can the movie be?) These are pretty awful things. It's 90 minutes of running, feels like an eternity and you'll probably curse life, so make yourself a great favor and go ahead, shoot this crappy movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are trying to sell this turd as a MST3K style that makes fun of the movie they made a decade before, and it works to a degree that it is still nothing noticeable, but Ariauna Albright is warm, but Lilith Stabs has a pretty unattractive voice. /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> DVD Extras: Joke Comments, 17 Behind the Scenes featurette; 7 minutes in the black featuret; Jessica Mills reporting; Stills gallery; and original trailer
