Normally I have no problem with a movie or story with an end that makes you wonder what really happened when it was deliberately done. <br /> <br /> But this movie really feels that they all have but the last 15 minutes that were done, realized they had $ 5 left to clear ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend you not spend money on it. If you watch it on TV, just watch the last 15 minutes, then walk away and make your own end in your mind. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie would have been better if they just got away, and come back with the Feds State Police just to find out that the town and the car cemetery were gone, and through all appearances was still never there ... <br /> <br /> "Wish I had more thumbs, so I can turn that movie down 4 inches!"
