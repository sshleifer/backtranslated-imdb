I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy came out, but I only saw two comparisons. The pace of this movie is rushing, many important scenes from the book are omitted, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and vibrant action scenes that have been painted over, which I have derived. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks down in the middle of the story and never finished. There are some good points - the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book much to the letter. Look at this one if you are in a hurry and cannot spend 10 hours after the new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book, you will probably be confused, because much of this version is missing. 4 out of 10.
