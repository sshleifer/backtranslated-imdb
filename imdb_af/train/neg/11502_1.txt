This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It carries the lives of a group of derived boat workers. One of the older people is sincere in his effort to find a job. There may be some social comments here, but it is astonished because no one is painted in a very sympathetic light. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why it had a 7.8 when I decided to see it. I watched the whole boring thing and built expectations for a big redeeming payout. No luck. The IMDb rating has always been such a good fit for my taste. Anything above 6.5 was worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says Javier Barem doesn't even look good in this movie. He's not my kind, so my deal doesn't mean much. <br /> <br /> Soak. I give it a 1.
