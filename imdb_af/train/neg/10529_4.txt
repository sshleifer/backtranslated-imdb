1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing music from a character development point of view, in my opinion, from this much-talked Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There are some good songs and a decent comic depiction, sometimes, of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner - but the film doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the institutions. I can only blame the script and possibly some of the plays for not fully understanding the character and their situations. I know it might be a little too much to ask for a musical intended for the enjoyment of the songs and the dance, but even this part did not stand out much for me. The basic storyline is about an English woman who comes to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things. We later find that the king is actually the biggest student. There is a forbidden romance between the King's latest wife, played by Rita Moreno (an Arabic Latino - come on!) And a former lover who causes complications, but nothing really pleasing. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie - is OK, but not convincing. The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie disappears as he does. It's really a minimal story with some songs and dancing, but not so great of a viewer experience.
