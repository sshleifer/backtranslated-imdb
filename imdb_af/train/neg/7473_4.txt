My husband and I were inspired by the spectacle - a much-desired Southern lady with a messy personal life loose crimes for the LAPD. The first season was tv for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season have become so boring and become unworthy of the strong character we stopped watching. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were upset about the episode where she was trying to hide her from the fact that she was being rushed. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hid her possible boyfriend's pregnancy, but told her boss. Why would a strong, middle-aged woman do those things? The answer is she won't. In addition, my husband and I choose the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white man or woman who was introduced into the cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family. Can't the authors do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer shows that do not betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
