Making it through the opening credits can make it your type of movie. From the first screen shot of a woman holding her hands to her face with white sheets blowing in the background, one reminds a pretentious perfume commercial. The main actress is basically a block of wood that her computer uses to reach in the past, and reconstructs the memories of photos, to discuss history's transmissible genius, Ada, who understood. the first computer language in the 1800s. <br /> <br /> The low budget graphics would be forgiven if it was interesting, or even a bit integral to the writing. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted.
