I've always said that some plays, by their very nature, just can't be translated into movie, and this one is a good example. <br /> <br /> As a play, it's a very funny farcic satire from the Catholic church with a razor and a central character so shockingly unreal, we need to root her even when she starts killing her congregation members (one of whom made the fatal mistake of acknowledging that he had not sinned since his last confession, so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven.) <br /> <br /> It's just one example of how far beyond reality the play goes, and in making believe world of theater, it works. This kind of increased reality rarely works on film, and it's certainly not here. <br /> <br /> Director Marshall Brickman has played a good role doing good work but offering all this absurdity in a realistic version. fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you have an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach. <br /> <br /> Find a stage production instead, you won't be disappointed.
