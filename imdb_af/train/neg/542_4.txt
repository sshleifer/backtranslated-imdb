First there is Gujarati Theater, then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fans. Director Vipul Shah has to look elsewhere instead of Gujarati theater when making a Bollywood production. First, he had Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - who had a unique plot but could not hold a Hindi movie. Now he has adapted another Gujarati game and called it Waqt - a race against time. In short, the emotions are alien. The plot development is not for Hindi movies. For example, the role-play between father and son is best for Gujarati Theater - don't put it in a Hindi movie. Even the comedy track is best for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - nothing to shout about - with the exception of Shefali Chhaya Shah which is fantastic.
