The acting is bad ham, all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children, if they have below average IQs. I realize it's meant for kids, but it's Malcom in the middle, but they still throw in adult humor and situations. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from a performance by Bob Saget, the only comedian in existence that is less funny than a man fighting a groin, which is probably why he didn't keep America's finest home videos. Parents, don't let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money. at college. Set your kids to dumb and they will grow up dumber.
