When I rented "Unhinged", I expected a gore movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence cut off from the theater release (I now have serious doubts about the fact that it is released in the theater). After the movie, I wondered how it could even receive a video release. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: A group of three young women on a car ride break their car into a tree. These women somehow pass their way to a mansion, which contains an extremely sexist woman. Besides, the film is composed mainly of useless scenes designed to make the film long enough for release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that make this movie horrible is the play. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to be reading her lines. The other act is bad, but not as bad as her. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. It gets very annoying as the movie progresses. In addition, there are many gores that make the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this one. My rating: 1 out of 10
