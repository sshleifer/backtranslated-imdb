This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories were rolled into one movie. Of course, other reviewers have picked it up, as there are several entries from the "first part" and "second part". How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and story appear for such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it suddenly stopped (it didn't 'end', it just stopped in what seemed to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an unbeaten and totally incredible second part all around a girl rearranging and cleaning a man's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent script to work with!
