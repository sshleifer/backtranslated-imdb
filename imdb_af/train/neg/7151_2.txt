I'm proud to say I've seen three fast and furious movies. Certainly, the plots are a bit stupid, and they may be a little cheese, but I love their car hunters and all the beautiful cars and the clandestine mid-races. And I like to see a fourth one. <br /> <br /> Want to know the difference between the three and Redline? Pleasant acting, somewhat thoughtful plot, even though they are potboilers, and lastly not the directors that All Three were made by many competent directors. They all took the movies in a different direction, just as exciting. Rescuers seem to have picked out a dozen women who slept on the decisive couch and made the extras. , then she picked up clues from Hollywood's unemployment line. And the script.Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. It is 70's that was bad for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie had a few cool cars, but you don't really see it in action, and the action is so bad that you don't get excited by the pursuits. if the cars don't thrill you, why go to a movie? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a lot of teenagers, and I can't stop laughing out loud. I get dirty looks, but it was just a debacle. <br /> <br /> Hire the R&F movies. Go to Nascar Race. Go to a karting track and race yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like a bad cheese.
