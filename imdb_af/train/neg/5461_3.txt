Like all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love the Twilight zone so much that they judge almost every episode, as they are the greatest performances. While several of them are indeed wonderful classics, the truth is for every major episode, there were several who were mediocre and at least one who stank. But like those hard Trekkies, these Zone lovers keep all of them gold. In fact, it initially reviewed me some individual episodes of some cultures instead of the movies I usually see. <br /> <br /> While it's not the worst episode ever made, it's also not the worst, it's poor with any reasonable standard. A widow looks at a long march of Civil War soldiers passing her home. In the end, a very unexpected turn is revealed and there is not much excitement or tension here.
