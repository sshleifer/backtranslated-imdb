I won't normally write a comment on the internet, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it filmed just like a soap series ("the young and the restless" is really filmed by professionals in comparison), but it also has terrible cuts. It has no action. It is full of useless garbage. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: a man wants to kill the main character because he's fired because of him. So (after much crap) here they are: the man puts a knife at his throat and says something like "You're now dead". Then the main character says: "If you kill me, you're dead. I told the police you're threatening me." So the (killer) man goes like (just about to cry): "Oh no ... the police follow me !? Oh, my God." Remember, this is just an example. I really can't believe this movie actually exists. So: If you ever want to see the WORST movie ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
