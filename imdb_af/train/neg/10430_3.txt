There are many good things about the new SCR: For example, there are the multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6, which played the two actresses perfectly. There is the old school's sense of industrial design aboard Galactica ("My ship won't be connected to my dead body!"). All the space fights, the special effects (though the seasoned sci-fi viewer is the cartoon of it all). The darkness of the characters, their essentially defective nature. <br /> <br /> It makes it all the more bitter that the end was so childish. Yes, the first part, the screens in space, the attack on the Cylons and everything that was very good. But the rough end? I always watch movies and show these days with the timer hidden, so I never know how much time left until the end. So for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end happen over and over. Every time I thought, oh, that's the final scene, the final shot, I still have one. Every fretting character has its full end! It wasn't really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really highlighted the school boys' amateurity of the whole: The young Roslin scenes. Why is it important for us to know this: (a) did she lose her sisters and father in a terrible accident and (b) that she was a one-night student at a former student / student? What brings it to the story? Where was the link? Now, I'm all for a more European-style style approach, and a random act of fornication in movies and shows, and all this, but it was just ridiculous. It didn't matter to the story. <br /> <br /> I also saw the "Last Fransin Special" and in it Ron revealed his own impeccability about the plot: he couldn't come up with a good ending to the story so .... just didn't do it! It's never so much about the characters as they made the last episode. The whole "it was thousands of years in the past", the mitochondrial Eve thing, was also used in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. And you believe there are many SCR viewers who know the particular H2G2 story. And talking about Hera, now there's a storyline that's not worked out well. Instead we get Roslin doing her former pupil who is 20 years younger. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. The more power for them. But that ... just made no sense. <br /> <br /> Overall (writing in) this series is as wrong as they meant its characters would be. It's even more for the last episode. I hope Lost and 24 do better, with their series of finals.
