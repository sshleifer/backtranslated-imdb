My comment may be a bit of a spoiler, because it's worth it. If you care enough, stop now. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace had to be titled: A Paper Thin Apology for Old British Women to Get High on the Screen. "This movie is stupid. The accidental music is a nuisance, just like the obvious, clipped songs that sporadically emerge for commentary on the story ("Spirit in the air", for example - Oh, I get it!) It's basically a Cheech and Chong movie made credible. through his stodgy English environment and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming power to cause emotion on an audience using her voice alone. I could literally hear the people at High Times magazine getting their jollies over the huge "buttons" that this picture rubbish. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to dress her illegal goods on the London street in a shining white dress suit. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of keen voice. Don't waste your time ...
