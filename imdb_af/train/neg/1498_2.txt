Justifications for what happened to his film in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and entertainers who wrote in writing, set aside again. Let's take this movie just as it is presented, without strange explanations. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Straightforward tight. Rather than rehash possibly serving as a plot, I will make a highlight of some curious points that will scratch my head. <br /> <br /> A class (of 5) takes a driveway for a history class to the middle of friggin 'nowhere in Ireland. These students can be Canadian or American, it's hard to tell. Filming in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is also obvious. One student seems to know nothing of history and is basically the "stupid jock" character from a number of kick ass 80's movies, except if he can channel Randy from Scream. One character can double Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girl who is likely to be killed, but it is never really established if it is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers ... just ... cuz ... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the role, is called "sir" more than once. He is very ominous and wears a knitted cap. His cousin is a rolled up pornstar with the worst Irish accent to be movies in my lifetime and probably beyond. <br /> <br /> Scenic Ireland features many Canadian forests and marshy areas and 2 ducks that appear more than once cut scenes. <br /> <br /> The producers received a discount on volume-false guts. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Unknown to me, terribly imported freaks have access to brand new hunting knives. Perhaps there is some kind of outdoor exhaust near, with a blind and deaf clerk working the registry. <br /> <br /> Not even known, if you infringe about 600 years, as the story tells us it happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, but incredibly sprouting and pretty strong. Genetics is a wonderful game of craps. <br /> <br /> There may or may not be more than one freak in this movie. It refers to "them" and we see shadows, but only one strange boyfriend is ever seen. And if one foreign boyfriend is eventually killed, it seems that all the danger is over. I go with my initial assumption that no one thought to postpone a second man in full makeup, so they only used one. That's how it looks on the screen. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco must be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Also, because of those shiny new knives, the innate freaks have access to some nice leather equipment, as Richard Greco cuts his tires, there is fresh ready for the next bumblebee. Who also escapes, because the chains give you enough tension to just undo them. A dead body in a cage will be cut to what I would guess is about 2 hours past. That dead body will also have glasses when no characters carry it. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson does not appear on stage for any reason left, chats for 2 minutes, disappearing stage left. In the middle of a huge forest. It's not uncommon, as Gary can also get out of nowhere, also known as what ever appears in the TV country of the screen. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Jameson dies unhappy and somehow her clothes disappear as I hope this movie won't suck the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special note to the "Wider" character, the poor girl used by the freaks. for months (or perhaps years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow and emotions on the camera with all the passion and beliefs of a stuffed chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie is clearly tackled by a drunk or a fiery mind Disability that is encouraged and encouraged with excessive petrol drinking over the years. It was apparently not a random crap I found late in the night on the movie network. It apparently heard people and even followed them. movie by its production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God be gracious to us.
