I was gifted with this movie as it had such a good condition, the friendship of three women civilized by the love of a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NOT! I hurry to add. These women are all drawn into extreme caricature, not very supportive of each other, and conspired and endeavoring to bring each other down. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton can't do my mistake in my book before I see it, but here they are handed a dishonest manuscript and said to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, what not working well if the women are all well-known specialists in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And for intelligent women, they spend a lot of time making up for the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that much more could be done of a decent writing and more tension, the lesbian subplot went nowhere and those who smoke / drink (already 3 in their forties?) Were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - Screw the baby, give a cigarette! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame on a waste. 4 out of 10.
