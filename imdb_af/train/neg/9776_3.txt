I don't know much about movie recording, but good movies have to tell some story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Excursion to Brooklyn they may, but it is not satisfactory, and I do not mean a happy ending, just an end. <br /> <br /> Last Excursion to Brooklyn, in Brooklyn in 1952 in a very brutal strike, set a number of story threads in motion. Most involve some of the most indifferent characters ever running across a movie screen. But Last Excursion to Brooklyn fails to draw these stories to any conclusion ... it lets some of them quarrel without end, or explode into a bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" end. <br /> <br /> Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite character (a key character in the movie) is hit and killed by a car. And it is for him in the movie .... he is completely gone, erased from everyone's memory .. no response from his friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread, the stupid, insignificant and secret gay strike leader, who was rejected by labor, his gay lover was rejected and invented by the neighborhood's thugs, is thrown away by the thugs. The final stage for the beat shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps ... and the scene is dragging on and off and on and off ... and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he is crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course it's also for him .... brain loss ..... gone. <br /> <br /> Bottom line .... no matter what the judges originally said about this film in 1989 ... This movie is a depressing piece of sludge. Avoid it. And if you're not warned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for large amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... don't let the teens look.
