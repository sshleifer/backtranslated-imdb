Brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. No one knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) points out that every bride wears a strange orchid and she interrogates his creator, dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz a crazy scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the flow of young brides to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting prospect and a short enough time that won't make it boring. Unfortunately, as it starts very well, it starts to drag before the mid-way and gets pretty dull with its clicks and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it. Bela Lugosi is charming and angry and does brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, separate and very creepy count; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter here. <br /> <br /> It maintains a bit of a Gothic atmosphere and sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall it just failed to keep my interest through the picture, and so I have to judge it poorly.
