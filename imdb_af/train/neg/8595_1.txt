Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly lead to any acting challenge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Detectives (2007) offer an only one to both actors and audiences: not to fall asleep during a sensible boring, highly predictable and imaginative story. <br /> <br /> "The Detectors (2007)" look very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly directed and embarrassing on the edge of followers. <br /> <br /> After a third of the film, even the most willing audience, as the directors' friends and family, can take for granted, is still not mentioned. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who loved it made it faked or it had to fade like Neil's ex-girlfriend did when he had her an old B&W movie she couldn't care less. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is nowhere near Category B, is it somewhere between Q&R, like -Questions? and -Repress the questions! The director knows what he is doing! Well, if his purpose was to kill the viewer, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> "Detecting the Detectives (2007)" was a total waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur PLEASE DON'T LET A WASTE OF YOUR TIME! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
