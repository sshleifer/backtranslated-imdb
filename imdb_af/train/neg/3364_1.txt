So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) always make the caretakers the gates at night without a clear reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke, etc. This Dr. tells them a ghostly story of this woman and a few children. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees his ghost. Some more talk than this great ghost and so on. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little children and that she should free their souls, yes yes blah blah. She does, oh no, she dies as she does. And go to heaven while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The writing is horrible because a man chops his head and Elanor (the one who dies to save the children) says "oh no". The play is wood, the effects are shit and the set is a few rooms that are used over and over. Actually, if you want to laugh, it's hard to watch movies, but if you're looking for a scare, then you should definitely give this movie a miss. I was very disappointed when I looked at it. A very big drop. My sister (who is very easily sanctified) got bored in this movie, it's terrible.
