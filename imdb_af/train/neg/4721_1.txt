Before watching this movie, take a look at the reviews available on the internet about the film's fake of events, especially the pre-adaptations generally accepted that 7-8,000 Muslims from Srebrenica were stormed out and shot by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to several pro-Serbian American organizations. Please review this movie critically, and read reviews in advance. Most reviews argue that the documentaries take his arguments too far, even if he raises questions about conventional wisdom about the war. An overview in the NYTimes by Stephen Holden claims that it is "inaccurate to nominate this documentary pro-Serbian", but one has to question both the submission of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of those facts interwoven with Serbian forces. I do not recommend seeing this documentary, but I will pay attention to examining it with a particularly critical eye (as it should always be).
