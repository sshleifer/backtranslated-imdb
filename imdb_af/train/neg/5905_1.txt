don't see it. It was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. It is difficult sometimes to be Mormon when there are movies like this. what a sad view of the life of Mormon. I can tell you if you've seen this movie, it's not so in a single center. if it were, I don't think I'd fix it. It's too bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who can't do anything better. the acting was so bad that my wife and I barely experienced it. I think you can say that it has all the signs of a B movie. or is there C movies? anyway ... I just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. I wish some Mormons would start making quality films.
