It was a horror of the same garbage we had to see during the half hour before it. Dave Coulier just thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos except with a host who has a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the junk for the junk. It was torture enough to see him following Popeye and other excited cartoons starting at Full House. This one man who has played all the jokes on everyone deserves a Grade A bet at the end. Coulier needs money to please Alannis Morisette while they are dating.
