I was hoping who fired the losers on their accents, was fired. The only high points are some of the supporting characters. 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put it in perspective.) <br /> <br /> The whole storyline is about sex, and nothing else . Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex to make vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex for vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we are afraid of vampires . , sex because we are vampires, sex because we just became a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> Nothing against sex, it will be nice if it is a bit more subtle to be peppered into the storyline. Maybe a storyline and then some sections in it. But they didn't even do it ... and Anna Paquin is a thumb gaping tooth bitch. Whether she sucks or sucks her character, I can't figure out which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the storyline I find highly flawless is why 150 year old vampire Bill who apparently has his stuff together would be interested in someone like Sookie. She is constantly flying out of the handle with him for things he can't control. He leaves for two days and she already decides that he "doesn't come back" and suddenly has feelings for the dog? Give me a chance. She is supposed to be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People who are near her die completely and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just gave her V-card to someone because she can't read his mind? As the main character of the story, I would have hoped that the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest, not someone you kept secret, hoping it would be killed or in " come coma. I can't find anything about her character that I like and even the fact that she can read thoughts is impressively uninspiring and not least interesting. <br /> <br /> I won't waste my time watching Season 2. come June.
