1st watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andr√© Dupont): The hidden version of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this multipurpose event. The replication of the disaster is not bad, but the drama about it is sometimes foolish, poorly acted and so-opera-like. The story is much the same as the most recent Oscar-winning one, except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the real-time, near-late disaster. Well just for nostalgic purposes and to get a feel for what James Cameron competes against (scarcely) in his recreation.
