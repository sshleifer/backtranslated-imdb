By the end of this excitement, Ally Sheedy's gaunt is being used creatively to create more than one ghostly evil. She convinced one that if a nasty Bette Davis type roll would come to her, she could deliver it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can't find many other reasons to see it. If you were wondering what Sheedy looks like in old-fashioned glasses (but why should someone?) Then here's your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sex starving mad woman is very tiring, and even if you like this kind of thing more than I do, you must admit that the tension is heavy during these scenes. Savage's drunk brutes of an insurance agent are equally unpleasant, but at least it's a minor role. Of the top actors, Nicholas Walker does not inspire Paul Keller's fate at all and his play is wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her plays with Sheedy the level rises a bit. Sheedy's meticulous, underestimated performance (though often on automatic pilot) is in itself admirable, but in context with the rest. The sets are dead, the camera work becomes indifferent.
