The very sad thing is that it's supposed to be the highest budget "Halestorm Entertainment" to work on. Everyone involved must be fined for littering, as all the celluloid they have wasted is nothing more than filling the trash. Not only is the writing horrible and the jokes awful, but the camera works and movie quality is at its best amateur. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop. The worst part of all is that I actually put the whole thing through. I just think I couldn't believe that I actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I watched actually agreed to show the "movie".
