This film should never be made. <br /> <br /> What a disgrace to the budget. <br /> <br /> Hire convincing actors and make a proper movie. Very thin plot, and unconvincing lines. Almost hilarious, and it's a shame for an action movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They are playing the same "shots" of a Stealth aircraft that is playing again. away. You saw it, and it wasn't worth doing it again 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from movie. <br /> <br /> Its movies are becoming more and more difficult every time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn, and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
