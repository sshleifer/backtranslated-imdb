OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday because the cover had a sexual insinuation in it. <br /> <br /> But we decided to look at it anyway. Just for hilarious purposes. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, but it must be one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> It started off well, and we thought "Okay, it might actually be good." But after about 10 minutes we unfortunately went wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious paintballer" was the obvious character, the Scouser / Australian (that was because I had an accent that can't be identified), whose acting power I just said it was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Then it came to an end, and by that time we all lost the will to live. The paintball finals. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this plot is that they haven't actually won, but they've won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know It has nothing to do with it, but the name the team gave was just terrible. Critical damage. I mean they could choose a more immense name, such as the "Antichrist Destroyer" or something. Or this is how the film should already be mentioned.
