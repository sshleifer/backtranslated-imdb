First of all, what's good in the movie? Some beautiful actress? the exotic background? the fact that the actors did not laugh while they were acting (I would have if I were in their situation)? I do not know. The storyline is simple: a Catholic priest doing abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) murdered his little brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young). I'm afraid there's nothing here to learn or to think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of 'profiler' (the series) with substitute actors and incredible accidents (the uncle is the policeman, the girl living at another victim's home can have a baby with the priest , etc.).
