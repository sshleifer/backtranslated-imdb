Barbara Streisand leads and stars in this many Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To get an education, Babs disguises her enthusiastically as a boy who is not the most difficult to do, as she already looks like a boy, anyway. At her new school, she meets many male classmates who have no problems at all because she believes she is an old man. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs's male friend thinks she's a man. but pins 'him' on the ground, put on top of 'him' and look lovingly at 'his' eyes .... * snicker *. <br /> <br /> Moderate film; spooky story about nothing particularly interesting.
