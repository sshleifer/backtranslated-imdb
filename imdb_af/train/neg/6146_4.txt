How this movie escaped the anger of MST3K, I will never know. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action movie that is filled (or is it empty?) With paper marks, silly characters and turbulent situations. But take it from me, if you like to look poor, but foolish, movies, you'll enjoy a "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The action is about a gymnast chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see his father was another quasi-government agent who competed in this game, which is eloquently called "The Game". So the gymnast (played by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> Sounds promising, isn't it? Okay, so that doesn't mean, but still, those bones' plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie. They can be found in the movie's strange details. Like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girl, who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie, suddenly starts talking and the rest of the time doesn't stop! Or the really tough, bullied bad guy who wants to make and break the "non-existent" rules of the game when he pleases it. And of course there is a wonderful skirt of our hero by the "Village of The Crazies" (this is of course the correct name of the place!). Nice place to visit, but I don't want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie really shines, the action scenes are. As our lead actor is a gymnast, the director thought of keeping gymnastics equipment in the back alleys and towns of the Middle Eastern cities so that our Gymkata master would be better able to use his gym skills to fight fight evil in parallel. bars and pummel horses. It must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing. Many, I want to say about half of the cast, die to be shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only credible effects or action in the whole movie. If that were indeed effects, I have one big note of compliments to anyone who invented these very realistic arrow wounds. More likely, it was the movie's way of not paying extras. Yet, "Gymkata" deserves a glimpse if you can see it without paying and is looking for some folly that is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
