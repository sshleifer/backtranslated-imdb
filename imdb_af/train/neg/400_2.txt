I rarely make these comments, but I forced others to spare about the pain I was suffering when I watched this movie. It's so stupid and indescribable in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend unbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government researcher in a new Porsche in a new Porsche and eat with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol building in Washington, DC. ................... Hah! It just gets worse. By the end, when the bad man starts to kill the good guys, the latter group stays so foolish that you want to die, to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy it - and the lead players were great in other movies, but the script and direction here are moronous. Many people wondered if there was any intentional intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous, facial stupor drugs (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should prevent the miracle. He's not bad.
