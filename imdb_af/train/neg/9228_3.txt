CQ is incredibly slow, and I'm a David Mamet fan. The film follows a young filmmaker who makes a very Barbarella-esque film. Then the movie lost me. Deep and deep? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" made in CQ has the problem of no end. This largely parallel CQ, which also has an end (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky to catch this movie at the SxSW movie festival. I had fairly high expectations of just watching Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other good movies. I also look forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it wasn't an easy movie to go into. If you're not in the 60-year-old sci-fi or slow movies that aren't true, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student life. If you want a recent sci-fi-esque in movie rental Donnie Darko, it won't let you sleep.
