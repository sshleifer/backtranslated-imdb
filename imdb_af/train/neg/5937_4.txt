Certainly, if you ask a mother who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she will tell you that her son is the most wonderful child in the world. She has the right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The producers of the movie were Biggie's mother and his good friend, Puffy. Oh, now, should I say more? I'll break it down for those who don't want a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can just add some biggie's MTV video together and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real one in life looks like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just wonder why he called himself Biggie small. Big body Little dick? Big mouth Little sound? Big fat Little eyes?
