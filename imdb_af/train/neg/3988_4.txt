In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee obviously has a lot on his head. He thinks of racism-colorism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "heterosexism", drug war politics, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> That level of consciousness is own is great. I think it's a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine the fundamental aspects of our daily lives. the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. But just because Lee is making controversial films doesn't make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What appears in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is mainly due to two major failures: <br /> <br /> First, Lee is just trying too hard. He seems desperate to accommodate every political / social statement he can make in the 90 minutes. And as such, the end result seems confused and insoluble, as he doesn't allow himself to develop characters who fully embody the ideas he hopes to offer. And so he exhausted stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and many loaded dialogues. The end result is very phased and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, by trying to make statements about such a wide range of community functions, it seems that there is no concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues being offered. What comes down to it is a pool of fearless non-sense. You feel that he has bought an elementary level sociology handbook and has washed out 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are highly problematic features because the film's artistry is sacrificed and the work is converted into a speaker for the voice of the movie maker's voice. He can't separate himself from the work and let it speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It doesn't work as an art piece or a good political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate Lee getting these important issues, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
