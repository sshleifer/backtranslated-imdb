"The Vampire Bat" is definitely interesting, as it is one of the early 1930s of early genre institutions, but in isolation everything is a bit too tight for any real praise. <br /> <br /> The film is In a European village I was somewhere in the 19th century, where a series of murders are attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals. There is a very similar feeling for James Whale's Frankenstein, and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's Dr Niemann character, complete with his wrong ideas for scientific advancement. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by despairing at the bat-loving village of Simpel Herman (Dwight Frye), which offers an excuse for a torch-moving gang to hit the rampage. go - as if they need one. <br /> <br /> This is one of a trio of early horror movies featuring Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-stars (including "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") and their other collaborative work film suffers from the wrong advice of comic lighting and a tendency to turn from horror to mainstream voltage elements. Even in the context, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and distracted. <br /> <br /> All we have left is a poor quality Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purifying a device to buy Dracula fans. But for the title, the film would struggle to be seen as an abomination and it is noteworthy that the director, Frank Strayer, did the Blondie movies a few years later.
