Some of my old friends suggested watching this movie, but I only got a chance recently. I have a high hope of seeing something from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a lot of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed. I couldn't understand what the message was except Hinduism. I am more like many religious types, but I felt that Kamal Hasan was one of those low characters who orchestrated these kinds of thoughts. He could have made a horror movie as this crap. He tried to add Hollywood genre of viruses, and God forbade him to turn the man into a mutant and eventually go for world domination. It's a great movie for a film school vs. regular audience. Sorry for him not having the talent he has. Beginning of story, Chaos tried to borrow ideas from Butterfly effect, then between small religious harmony at the expense of Hinduism. (Again, I insult Hinduism more, but this film is not equal and my insult is the same for religion in general which has made this movie intellectual one.)
