Many King fans hate it because it went away from the book, but film is another medium and books have to change when they make the jump. However, the movie fails completely, but it fails entirely on movie terms. I would like to make the people who tell me this is the scariest movie ever made. I always follow the question "Actually ... exactly what scene made you scared?" Every fan I asked went silent. Sometimes someone with a loss for a decent scare (there is no ...) calls the "grape juice-shoot-out-of-elevators" shtick. If you're scared, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe you're scared. I just rolled my eyes and watched these z-grade horror ideas play in this shocking, disjointed movie. <br /> <br /> One thing that distracts it from the book and is really unsatisfactory is the tedious work the movie does for Mr. Halloran until the Overview to kill him only; with the stupidest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the hallway that it needs Halloran EARER to walk. Actually, one of the stupid rows is ever on film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and good choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more "out of place" shot in any movie ever made? <br /> <br /> I consider it a miracle that I could eventually bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important movie, given the tremendous "bad will" generated by both this stupid , stupid movie, and the cult of fawning, but relentless Kubrick fan boys, who could not describe an idea at work with every film resource in the Library of Congress before them. <br /> <br /> Break into the grotesque persecution of Jack Nicholson, the launch of stupid one-liners on strained moments, and the Razzie nominated show of Shelly Duvall and you have a lot of crappy movie.
