C'mon people, you can't be serious, another case of advertising sniff when it's not at all! It's not even frightening or frightening - it's just a horrible amateur video work that's being made for the next party to let the girls down. <br /> <br /> The gore is incredibly bad, even the eye -Scene is far from making me falter, but just to let me go, take the camera and push the guys over the head. The girl is lying there just rubber-face, not moving at all. It would have been better to rather use a real doll. <br /> <br /> One season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more scary than this one. Don't waste your time or money.
