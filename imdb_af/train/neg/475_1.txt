One of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American History class and the aim was to see an attack on the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800s. What we saw was pigs shot and then slaughtered, human birth, surf. Oh and in the end there was a lively calf birth and let me tell you that the birth itself was not bad, but the many fluids that came out drove most people into my bathroom class. The story itself was OK. The foreground of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move west to be a housekeeper of this cowboy. They live a life of hardship and this is an interesting, fairly accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, don't see this movie.
