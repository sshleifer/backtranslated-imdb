This whole movie had to last 45 minutes. Although an interesting concept / theme, it really did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (dumb?) Bomb division expert (cowboy?) Is introduced, and it happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitive. Characters were not investigated, and aspects of location and politics were ignored. There was some good insight into the terrible problems faced by troops in such a strange environment, and the difficulty of distinguishing between friend and enemy. But the way the unity stretched out was shaped! Individual performances were good and special effects were adequate but not enough to overcome the basic shortage of content.
