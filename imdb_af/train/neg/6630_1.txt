This so-called remake is terrible. I went here tonight. On the first day when the expectation and hype were too much for me to handle. But within the first half hour we knew it was a disaster. Not only does it match the hype that was created, but it also insults the original blockbuster. The script had loopholes, the editing was pretty neat. Mohanlal, an excellent actor, has done a good job. Amitabh was right. The director wanted to portray how angry his character was, but he went a little overboard which led to it being compelling. Ajay, who is especially smooth in this kind of roll, was also a disappointment. Don't even start the new man Prashant. One would not be proud to start such a career. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown in for a few laughs, couldn't even get a smile from someone because of his powerful humor and the shrill voice. Nisha Kothari has proven that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, I was thinking of being one of the most talented and gifted directors in India. Failed to fail. He had such a great challenge and responsibility to repeat what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and made a mess of it.
