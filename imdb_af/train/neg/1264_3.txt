This movie doesn't have a terrible part with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This should also be the reason why his most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a good prospect of giant robots that would fight each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead has a completely dull story that is not very original or clever. A disgrace tried to disagree so much of his predecessor, otherwise it might be a more fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Like 'Robot Jox', it's a B movie, but with a big difference it's not just a very good one. Perhaps it should be with the fact that "Robot Jox" was made in the 80's, when B-movies had a bit of charm and class, though the film was released in 1990. It really can't be said about this movie. It's just lame, bad, poor and not exciting enough. It also has an end that makes you think "That's it? It's all?". <br /> <br /> The movie that lacks its story is really clear, main line, maybe a good head villain. good idea and a few other things, such as a real point for the story, some actions or similar main characters, what they think when they chose the actors for this movie, all of them simply are not nice in their roles not and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, acting as if he is God's gift to wife and Mr. Perfect who can compete with anyone. Were they not even able to get the actors of the first movie? /> <br /> For such a futuristic movie, with a concept of having great throttles in it, this movie is missing its action. If they made more and more action in the movie, the movie would have at least a more be entertaining to watch, instead, we now have a movie that did not impress impressively. <br / > <br /> You can look better at a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode, for even more action and likeness. <br /> 3/10
