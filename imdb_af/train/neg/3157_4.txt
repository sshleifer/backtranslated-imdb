Sure, it has some of the goodies of a good movie. The storyline is good, if a little thin and the play was good enough, although I didn't understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character were to be educated in America. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I know as a rule, the average American is considered a frumpy dresser by any self-respecting European but it was beyond that. Anna's color combinations were positively terrible !! And that potato-bagged, sad excuse for a coat she wore through the film made me break into hives. I think the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers are in Prada?), But simply does not mean an absolute lack of taste. A word to the wise ...
