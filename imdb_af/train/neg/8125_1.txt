"The Bat People" is a very bad movie that deserves the MST3K treatment just as well as the other movie, The Creeping Terror. In it we are in a mountainous terrain full of bats. . We see a lot of things happening, like bats flying out and attacking and things, station watches, emergency room crashes, and more! All this, plus the cute mediocrity of the 1970s (hey, think "Mitchell" here!), And actually make the Bat People one of the best episodes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the series! Movement movement, it's terrible. This should be avoided like the plague unless Tom Servo and Crow watch you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
