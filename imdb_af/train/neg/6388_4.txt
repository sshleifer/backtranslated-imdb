The Brothers Quay are directors, judging by conventional thought, to hold short films. I really liked myself much of their first feature, Institute Benjamenta, but judged by their efforts, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I am willing to agree that they do not compare to their previous genius by function length. Piano Tuner is undoubtedly a beautiful movie to watch and often listen to. Unfortunately, the border is painful to go through with its winding narrative and glowing fit. Read the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. But the Brothers failed to bring it to life. One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible here. A great bust.
