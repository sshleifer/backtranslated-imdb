Is Miike like Chabrol, alternating art with liquor, sometimes the two confused? Does he agree with Chabrol with the fifty / fifty rate? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill in 10 lines that only steal Chakushin ari's (One Missed Call's), play and click. Others here will hit most of them, though not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) issue to the rogue who finds unnatural things. Only once, when Yumi took the mummy-like mother in her arms, One Missed Call started to scare me a little. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in the audition's insulting story, and as Death or Alive's boss Aoki drowned out of the barrel of defecation and more, could be the most convincing evil character I've ever seen. So here he is a policeman.
