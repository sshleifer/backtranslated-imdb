Is there nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, look Phat Beach. However, don't rent it and definitely don't buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV and found that I was laughing at some points. I didn't sleep long and I didn't laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you're looking for a very funny "hood" movie, watch Friday. If you're looking for a powerful emotional movie (something this movie is trying to do), look for something like hope dreams or Jason's Lyric. If you're looking for some good black "booty" look at a Dominique Simone porn girl, because the nudity in this movie is almost non-existent. However, if you have nothing better to do and it's on the cable, look and watch. You will be slightly amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
