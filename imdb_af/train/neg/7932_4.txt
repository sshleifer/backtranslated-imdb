Oh, dear! What a disappointment. I've been watching old Western on British TV for years, and I wasn't aware of this until she showed her yesterday. Most other Scott-Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth a look. <br /> <br /> The rich color and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most other negative comments already made. Several times I felt like switching it off, and eventually I was halfway through something I almost never did. Scott felt unusually oily in the charm of the girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the Mexican bandit. And I have a feeling that the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern, not that they were the makers of many other Westerners. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it got better in the second half, but I couldn't be bothered to wait and see.
