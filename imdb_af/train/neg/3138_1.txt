I see people writing about how good this movie was. It was terrible! The acting was at its best sub-par. It made a lot of money because teenage girls followed the movie 7 times in the theaters due to Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I want to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, running through many people's minds; maybe even some conspiracy things. Does anyone know that some people didn't even have the ship, because there was a fire on board before it even started? No, you don't, because everything you see is a rich girl who falls for a poor boy and makes her naked. (Did that funny mess mean at least that the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> I've been crying in one scene. The scene when they saw the water in the ship. It looks like pool water! I think this movie made all this money and couldn't even see the water from the sea, really? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Oh, the band played while the ship was sinking. Not ridiculous. It was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor left it in the "Nothing to do with reality" section.
