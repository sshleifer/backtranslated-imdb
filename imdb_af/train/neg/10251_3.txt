A good thing to walk around. A weak pregnant opponent with very little complexity. A scientist working in communication, sending signals to space and receiving it, is caught up with strangers. Along with his beautiful wife, he enters their territory and secures them. Rather, he becomes treacherous in the process. Granted, he gets little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. It's a dull movie with very long regions where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, explore a forest, explore a building. That's what editing is about. I think the story will no longer technically support it. Not much here.
