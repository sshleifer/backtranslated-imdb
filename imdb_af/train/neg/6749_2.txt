This mess is so bad that it doesn't even qualify as abomination. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is totally wasted in this movie. She's not even the villain. The rest of the actors look like porn wannabes and the plot is so lame. I won't even mention it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and hit the end credits to hear the upcoming band TwoMarlowe play, better than Sex "it's altogether 80's Disco Candy song. Beautiful tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. Road more entertaining as "Bleed." Put it that way, If you have the equipment to copy videos, but decide to record the song at the end of the movie, you have a lot of BAD movie.
