I have read a few books on Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, in that the costumes and locations include the actual photos of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the pictures that Blanche grieved that day about her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay beautiful until the end, even after they were shot dead (in life Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the year before their famous ambush and didn't look right a beautiful cheerleader at the time of her death. The writing is boring, and the acting is poor, especially the lead. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. They may not be the true story, but it's a good movie.
