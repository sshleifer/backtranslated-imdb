I've never read Gary Paulsen's novel, Hatchet, for which a Cry in the Wild is the adaptation, so I can't make comparisons with the book. However, I would say that as a movie on its own, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that did not give an important explanation of its characters. <br /> <br /> Think of a cry in the Wild 'As a lesser luxury teen climber (Quincy, California was the only place where it was filmed?) version of' Cast Away. "Jared Rushton is 13-year-old Brian Roebson, a kid who is heading for a small plane to visit his father until the vessel crashes over a deserted mountain terrain. The kid has been stranded for some time and had to defend himself. <Br /> <br /> There are basically three parts to the movie. The obvious is the ten or fifteen minute launch of the characters, Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third of the movie (which almost uses all the movie) is that of Brian swiping it. These screens have no wonderful action, nothing but very beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing to put you on the brink, no real encounters (except a lively confrontation with a cub) and no big dilemmas to start a kind of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. You may even be bored for a while with the passage of time, as our Brian testifies to his situation through first primitive means, and then more improved (using tools, etc.) for his survival. It's more like the usual time gone by if you've actually held onto the situation, and it's pretty much. In other words, they put no meat on the Paulsen's words when they translated it into a visual media. <br /> <br /> And of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a subplot constantly trying to make itself known during this time. Some conflict between Brian and his parents who created a rocky, uncomfortable relationship between them. For the most part, however, it only briefly, briefly, explains minimal dialogue flashbacks that look more like a storytelling for a music video. Any minute, the singer of Jefferson Starship, has to start singing "Sara." Unlike the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess his own need to fill the gaps in the story, we get a very underdeveloped story that was probably needed to enjoy at least part of this movie and a connection to make with the characters, whether it really had anything to do with Brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie. These are the flaws in the narrative that the viewer stares in a stupor while struggling to figure out what the people are doing on the screen and almost did me screaming on television to say something and tell me more! <br /> <br /> It was definitely not a good adventure story for me. But, for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last few films he made. So, look it purely for nostalgia, as nothing else.
