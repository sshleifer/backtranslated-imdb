No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing of the release was terrible. The Gong Show has already jumped the shark when the movie came out, so who would pay money to see just a few of the censored cuts from the original show? And the showcuts are just a little bit of this pathetic, 90-minute grind by Chuck Barris on how difficult his life was to host the show. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his mess millionaires? Did he really think we wanted to know about his life? (Obviously he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA operator.) Did he think the gag to have everyone, would the audition be fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive in turn? It could have been the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and the Unknown Comedy again (though, to make the movie "spicy" they only included its most vulgar routines). And as someone else pointed out, it's Phil Hartman's first significant movie (although it's only a minute's duration). Note that his name HARTMANN was spelled in the credits, namely the name with which he was born. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions, though he is much thinner and younger than in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small portion; one of his first after leaving the sea world.
