Ever wondered why Pacific Islanders automatically adopt the sense of humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic origin? Well, this movie won't give answers to this often-considered question, but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie is a kind of "Old School" for Pacific Island New Zealanders, who immediately asks what exactly is the point of such a task. Is it meant to endure native stereotypes of the Pacific Island New Zealanders? or is it meant to exploit this potential market? The story is poor, jokes humorless, and the end is expected. This film did nothing for New Zealand theater, because it is simply a dedicated romantic comedy that lacks merit.
