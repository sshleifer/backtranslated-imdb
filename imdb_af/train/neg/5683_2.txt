From the beginning I had a feeling like a movie about another Jason's on Friday the 13th. And that's ... Dispute that the movie is getting interesting. But as the times go through his just a relentless movie about subdued, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean he doesn't see anyone under the man's bed without making any noise. He was supposed to be blind after failed performance, but he walked and killed people as he was used to. I'm tired of it. For me this is all the same. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. <br /> <br /> Well-behaved scene with tide woman looks impressive only at first:} For that and for plot, 2 stars.
