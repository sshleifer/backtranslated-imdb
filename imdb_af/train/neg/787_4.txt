As an inspiring director myself, this movie was exciting to consider critically. Shot with a low-end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting, sound effects are not over. I'd give it a 7 for an indie movie, but the story isn't that interesting. It's more on the drama side, character developments than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> It's not for those who want them to be spooked, scared, or sit down with popcorn just to enjoy. <br /> Honestly, this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and it is.
