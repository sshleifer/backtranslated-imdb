The plot is about the death of grandchildren. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murders. During the film, he seems to have some problems with his daughter. In the end, the serial killer is caught. That's it. But before you find out who you have dunned, you have to act all the actors terribly. It's amazing how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I can go on like this, but it wastes too much of my time. Just don't look at the movie. I warned you.
