"Unhinged" is a strange little movie, a forgotten booth from the golden age of the genre. It's really hard to write a satisfactory review of this movie simply because the movie is so unique. The plot is pretty exaggerated - three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car accident and end up stranded at the home of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. In addition, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they are intensively facing their living room at dinner. The old mom even goes so far as to call her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sleeping at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, when one girl finally decides, she's better off finding help, starting the murder. <br /> <br /> As far as the acting goes, this movie is at the bottom of the bar. NO of the three stranded girls can act, especially the "main" girl. It's almost unbelievable to hear that they are delivering their lines in the same wood species through the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The movie is also pretty boring in parts and really, really bears. The murders are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen yet. However, as mentioned above, the movie really gets points with it brilliantly disturbing and greedy ending. It is completely left-handed and has the same shock value as the end of the camp-classic "Sleepaway Camp." Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a drill and suffers from terribly acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, precursor lighting give the film a granular realism, but it is quickly broken when one of the characters tries to act. It can be worth it if you can stick it out to the end, but I say you are better off just faster for the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
