It was really scary! It was a terrible storyline, acted poorly and was like an amateur remake of evil, but not so good. <br /> <br /> It made my overall effort to make it through this one, it's a good job. I didn't have to visit the toilet, otherwise I doubt I would come back! This one makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big-screen Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only value for this movie was the never-ending supply of beautiful women. Not a bad one among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to hang out with your friends after a night on the beer, then this one is for you ... otherwise it will be like the plague!
