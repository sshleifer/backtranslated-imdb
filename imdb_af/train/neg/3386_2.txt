Yes, I was lucky to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett's hit music. It was a wonderful experience and I paid to watch the movie when it was hit in the theaters in 1985. It's terrible. Almost everything failed. First, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as John Huston was hired to miss ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut the songs and the CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry talented artists just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you can't take their eyes off them. But this role just gets through dancing, makes a "nice" work that sings, but none of them spark one piece. In fact, look at the cast on IMDb - none of them really did anything. (OK, okay, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this movie train wreck for one second captures the magic, the despair, the passion of stage music. A total result! (Even though they try to suffocate the music - the big music is still rising at times and reminds people how big the score was).
