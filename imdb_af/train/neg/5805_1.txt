Anyone who has seen the original will have to go and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin tries to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word recovery word, just not working. While Baldwin did some great work, it's a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never tried to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw, enough has said. McQueen looks dangerous, threatening and credible like Doc, the movie has excitement and excitement, Baldwin and the company made it into a comedy. I laughed once and for all, and I saw this unfortunate movie. And that awful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today's more exciting and credible actors! Did the makeup people put it in for Michael, what do they think? If you want to see the movie, it was under Sam Peckinpah's direction. Get the original!
