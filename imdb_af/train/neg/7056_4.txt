This movie is a good example of how even some very funny jokes can go awfully wrong. I really expected something from this movie, after seeing the addition that was funny like hell, but the movie wasn't half as good. <br /> <br /> The weird part is that the jokes are actually funny, the spoofs of the smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc. are really good jokes, but I don't know who to blame this flop. <br /> <br /> The first candidates can be: - 1) The hammers (actors) and hammerers (actresses) and not even the funny kind 2) The director 3) The man the actors and / or the director anyway, if you are really bored and i really mean this movie, or get a copy of every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt because it will be far worse than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only saving grace of this movie is mahesh mankAR and the funny chappu bhai
