What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant narrators of our time? Well, he made the sort of typical summer action nutrition that could be regulated by someone from the film school ... and they would probably have done better work. They would have placed at least half a thought in the terrible script. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through a wormhole and landed in a monkey-controlled planet. (grab!) Apart from this time, the monkeys fall through gratuitous dialogue, immeasurable plot, and striking special effects that continually reinforce in my mind that this money is up to about 10 independent films as 'masterpiece' alongside these trips. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy the beautiful scene talent, Tim Roth, his performance as an evil monkey leader, Thade, is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Fortunately for him, the makeup as an actor allows him to retain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his sound and sniffles. <br /> <br /> And unfortunately, the ever-reliable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and leading the woman and hooking them in the end without any kinship development or cause. And the "haha, we're so smart, aren't we?" way Hollywood mixes references from the original POTA in this one. Suck ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing it, spend the night calling up some friends and renting 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands',' Batman 'or even in' lesser 'sleepy' hollow, and reminiscent of the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not ashamed and mocked.
