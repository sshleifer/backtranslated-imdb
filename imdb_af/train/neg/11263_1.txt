For shame, it is a pity that a good actor like Joseph Fiennes can throw him into this broken failure. The movie was not only bad, but rightly frightening and of no quality. The plot (was there one?) Looked like there was no place. The Russians have played to kill or be killed and the rest of the cast must be declared invalid for their pathetic actions. I gave up about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. A "1" for the awful just because there is nothing lower. Don't waste your time on this one, you won't miss anything.
