I grew up about the entangled stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that someday a scriptwriter would be sitting around their child in a big bench reading a Winkle in Time, and would think that would make a great movie. Unfortunately, the scriptwriter failed, changed characters, threw lame humor, and destroyed all the plots. I know it's a difficult task to change a beloved novel into a movie. But why can't you stay true to the book? Why change the way characters think and act? For those who haven't read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild.
