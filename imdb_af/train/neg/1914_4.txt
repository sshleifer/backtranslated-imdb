It's not bad, but it's not good. it's just entertaining. <br /> <br /> as a comedy that's supposed to be, it's awful. Not much laugh, because every joke in the movie has been done a million times before. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all the actors in the film are very good, but none of them really works much. and the end sucks.
