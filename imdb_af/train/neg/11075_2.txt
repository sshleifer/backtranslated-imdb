One day there was a science fiction author, called H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy". It was about a man who discovered a race of adorable little dirty humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's writers began to plunder his grave before his cadaver became cold. This is the book where they come up with the idea for Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of "Little Fuzzy". I wonder why I was the only one who ever noticed. <br /> But don't use my word for it. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of Little Fuzzy for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
