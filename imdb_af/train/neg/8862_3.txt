From the moment Christopher Lee tackles a few punk sunglasses and tries to smash into a punk rock club, you know you have a stinker on your hands! This film had potential. Among all the slime there are the remnants of what could be made into a decent film, if not an interesting one. The final product, however, is a real mess. In addition to the generous nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II is excited for a terrible excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives it some credibility, but even he can't raise it above the level of crap. <br /> <br /> Having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to face the face appreciating that it is a true continuation of events in part one. We start with a funeral for one of the characters from the original and within the first ten minutes we find in Transylvania a small group of heroes ready to fight a covenant of werewolves. The movie is pretty well played, and there aren't too many dead spots. The action is there; it just isn't filmed well. One bright point is the music of a punk band called Babel. Although their song is played regularly, it is tough. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie are huge in number. First, the play is worse than miserable. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. The two leads Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are lacking in just about anything you want for such characters. The writing is miserable, the editing redundant, and the direction amateur. There are some good special effect gimmicks, but the cheesies far away weigh them in number. Sybil Danning is nice to watch, but her performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks at the role he plays, but his voice and acting are not convincing to say the least. Much of the dialogue is in an incomprehensible language that may be Latin. <br /> <br /> I kept the general idea for the story. I always enjoy stories of true believers to pursue, seemingly invincible powers of evil. One scene where a small group of good guys pull through a dark forest and shoot a lot of werewolves is even exciting. Kind of. Perhaps a bigger budget or a better director made the rest of the movie a little more compelling. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Lace note: Of these letters, the sensors on youtube.com have still not deducted the final credits with Sybil Danning ripping. off her top while playing the Babel song! Catch it while you can!
