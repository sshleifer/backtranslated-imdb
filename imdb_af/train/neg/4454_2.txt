First background; I am English and have lived in London throughout my life. I was in many games at The Den and most other London club grounds. I'm familiar with the type of person who comes in hooliganism and I just know how they act and how they talk. It must be a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. I cut most of the movie with embarrassment. I felt I had to write a mini review because I felt I had to point out a few things. <br /> <br /> People do not speak so much in London in real life; the filmmakers grabbed the whole snake thing too far and made it silly. Unfortunately, hooligan types exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor playing Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded like "English" or "Cockney" like Osama Bin Laden. He's from Newcastle in Newcastle and I'm just surprised by any of the other actors who can face straight ahead of him - how we should take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done a little work myself, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo I mean, how can I be expected to take Elijah Wood seriously to raise the ass of men twice and that is actually nasty hooligans. He'll be dead. As simple as that. Honestly (like a Briton) it was difficult to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will bombard here in the UK. It can do a little better in the states because the Americans just don't know if it's inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, this firm does exist, but it is all extremely underground and on a much smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 of me because they actually filmed it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and we all expect not to notice.
