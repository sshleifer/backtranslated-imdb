I had to walk out of the theater. After an hour, all I saw was women who were deceiving women, rubbing coughs like dogs, and using the f-word like a diabetic use of EQUAL. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> This was particularly frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any one of the characters could have been very interesting if they were given more than fornication, talk about it and swear to each other. <br /> <br /> The few times it seems like it's about to be a kind of character development, everything that happened was another sex scene. Vinnie sees murder scene over the Atlantic East / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on woman, and 5) Joey (most sympathetic character in the 1st hour). the show is kicked out of his parents' home. More than that I didn't wait to see. <br /> <br /> Photography and the interaction between characters was great, but there was nothing for them to do. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth another hour to wait for ANYONE to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption. Either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
