Increasing Victor Vargas terribly fails in what he is trying to be the most: actually. Unfortunately, there is no reality for this movie. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and false. <br /> <br /> The reason? Bad direction. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It looks like Mr. Sollett has read somewhere that his film will not be relieved, it will give a real feeling. Wrong! It just gives it a bad feeling. Similarly, if the camera is shaken, it does not give your film a documentary style, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on the screen, rather than improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what's on the screen is so painfully counterfeit, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his screenplay with the sole purpose of trying "hip" for his Sundance friends and showing how a filmmaker is "edgy". <br /> <br /> Overall, the only lasting impression this film leaves you is what a bad director said. Sollett is. Next time, how about a few writing and legal classes?
