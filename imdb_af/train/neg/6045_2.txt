This is an interesting idea that went wrong. The hidden meaning in art that is interpreted as clues sounds intriguing, but the performance in Anamorph is extremely slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the film except sowing. The deadly clues are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything they commit is annoying. Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator, but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit. Several supporting character characters are wasted, including Peter Stormare as art artist, James Rebhorn as chief of police, Paul Lazar as medical investigator, and especially Deborah Harry, who appears on the back of the DVD case, but has only spoken a few lines by " a cracked door. Not recommended. - NOTE
