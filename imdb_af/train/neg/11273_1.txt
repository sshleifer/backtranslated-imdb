How can you collect these respectable role-players from young British actors and arrive at such a heap of cinematic dung? Terrifying writing, annoying, hasty camera, terribly edited, horribly bad. Just Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that "otherwise" sometimes looked "drunk". Why do people fail to read the scripts beforehand? Do yourself a favor: save yourself and do something else - like hitting a hammer on your knees. It's less painful and fun than this movie!
