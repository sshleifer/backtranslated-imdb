It was another big screen outing for an American TV show from the sixties. It is amusing enough, but was a lot of formula. Intelligent Martia land on Earth and meet the not-bright people, in his view. <br /> <br /> The usual wackiness occurs in humans, Bridges, eventually joining him and helping him get home. Along the way he also gets the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> It's a nice outing for some of the Hollywood stars I haven't seen before. <br /> <br /> Nice enough to pass a little free time if you have nothing better to see.
