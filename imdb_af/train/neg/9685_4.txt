I don't know about you, but I've always felt at 'ART' festival. The first art movie I managed to hold was Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" that exaggerated my thoughts and creative muscles. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque. This is what 'cinema' is about, and explores intellectual ideas and puts the visceral on the screen for that purpose. Life, real life can be like staying in a madhouse, and art expressing it to what it is. I like movies of all kinds, but especially those who both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with his attitude or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN", is a dry, clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to relieve their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very short note to Fellini in the film, unlike the previews. The main focus of the film falls on the "close" relationship between father and son, brought along after the mothers' death. In the early scenes of the film, the fathers' grief is credible, you can feel its pain. What happens next is clear through Greenaway standards, the gathering of the harem, observations of love and death, and flesh is shown for the sake of flesh ... It may argue, but I feel the movie is level and useless. And the idea that it can be a comedy is confusing to me. The acting for the most part, if it is good, is especially Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy has to wear her clothes again). What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touches the excess that its other movies look so wonderful. <br /> <br /> Whilst filled with moments of insight, and sometimes a taboo, 8 1/2 women are cut and pasted to be considered art, to be considered "funny", and just too boring to be considered worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleep program. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
