Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; It features a lovely happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the palace's minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to accept a terrible Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It's hard to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; Although the actors alternately look noisy (the lovers) and silence (the cement mixers). The sets "The Sealed Room" look very phased. The performances are good, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The sealed room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
