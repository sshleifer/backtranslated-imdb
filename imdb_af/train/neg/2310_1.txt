It was a truly incessant film. The performances are the third time, and the dialogue is so quiet that sometimes it just seemed to have rolled over and died. My reason for renting this was simple: Find a movie with writing. I need a visual help for my presentation, so I figured out why not use a clip? Boy, I was wrong. After driving my local video store, I came across this, where it was suspiciously "Starstruck". I thought, "What the hey," and decided to try it. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. There may have been one scene I could use, and in the meantime I almost fell asleep due to the sheer banality of the movie. So ..... I took it back and picked up Ed Wood. There is a movie I can use as an example. Then again, anything can be represented compared to the drift that "Starfucker" is.
