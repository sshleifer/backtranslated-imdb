"Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But sentiment at the expense of confidential honesty. Nobody should love it." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> In the early 1900s, the Color Purple is located in the Deep South and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African American sisters. The film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic resort that is quickly crushed by the appearance of their stepfather. This motif ?? innocence interrupted by men ?? penetrate the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The movie then starts in a series of short rows. Celie is revealed to be conceived twice by her stepfather, birth in a dirty barn, has taken away her newborn and has been forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a violent officer who has repeatedly raped her and her force to cook, clean and watch his children. <br /> <br /> All these horrible scenes are given small screen time, surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography, an awkward symphonic score, indifferent comedy and excessive camera work. The cumulative effect is like the merger of a Disney cartoon and a rape film, a spectacular aesthetic, which led Stanley Kubrick to point out that "The Color Purple" made him so nicer that he had to do it after ten minutes. off. Ten minutes? He lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> The film is often said to deal with what "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but it is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel on which the film is based, claims to be bisexual, but is actually a lesbian cupboard. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery, which paints men like violent brutes that dumb women. For Walker, the only way out of this maze is that women are celebrated together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence. <br /> <br /> However, Spielberg's film depicts Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies. It is a film in which the holy power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. A movie in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations is moments of misplaced comedy that makes him look like a clumsy fool. A movie in which all the characters are derived from racist minority shows, the role-players consist of lifeless men (always striving with devilish smiles and tooth grunts), stereotypical fat mothers, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> It is a film in which black people are, of course, childish, who readily accept their social conditions. A movie in which black people are about sex, carnal sensualists are dominated by violent passions. A movie in which poverty and class issues are completely invisible (Albert lives in a large house) and black men are completely ineffective. It's not the Old South, it's Old South, as derived from "Gone With The Wind", MGM Muscals, "Song of the South", Warner Cartoons, "Halleluha!" and prohibit Disney movies. In other words, it is the South as seen by a child raised on the 50-year-old TV. It's all so cartoony, so racist in the way it diminishes these people into one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist Ishmael Reed revealed it to a Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion, the film ends with family ties that are cured. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes on to reconcile every character in the story with their family. <br /> <br /> In addition to Walker's hate letter to black men and Spielberg's bizarre caricature of black life, we are shown nothing. of the black community. We only have the faintest ideas on how any of these characters make life and no understanding of how they interact with others in their community. Instead, Spielberg's camera jumps around and runs for our attention. (One of Celie's kitchen barriers seems to be in a "Home Alone" movie), every emotion played stops the director just to see something or show a little of life simply to succeed. Connect it with Quincy Jones' ridiculous "white" music, and you have one of the strangest movies in theatrical history: a fierce feminist channel filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith, by a black man who John tries to imitate Williams. <br /> <br /> The lack of white characters is also problematic. Consider: The men in this movie are not portrayed as rough and do not dominate women, because they are broken by a racist society that reduces their masculinity. No, they are cruel by nature. And the women, whether silly or rebellious and stubborn as her sister suffers, persist and survive just because the men are too stupid to destroy them. A better movie would not only have focused on the suppression of women as it is among the oppressed, but rather it would have proven to be social abuse that led to spousal abuse, forcing addicted black women to do the same. perform. If their male counterparts (while still performing traditional female roles) and that domestic violence in African America is largely due to economic factors, women cannot support themselves and their children alone. <br /> <br /> And so there is a hidden ideology at work here. Late in the film, one character tells another that, since he did not respect his wife, she sustained a serious blow and was taken captive by whites. The implication is that blacks must return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites are unjustly shattering them. ie - Respect each other in your poor minority community and you will not run out of the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequences loaded with strange visual pizazz, careless comic affairs, emphatic musical ways, and wild-style emotionality all add to the rendering "The Color Press" worthless.
