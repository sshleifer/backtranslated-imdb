What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot that includes a dead philanthropist is actually a headache-impressive story of a lot of characters (the only major actor Ginger Rogers is in a very early role) who are all trying to kill the killer among a small group of residents in a solid apartment building. These characters range from completely silly to straight in common. As a cheap, low-budget production, most of the action turns to Rogers and her chief (an old, I don't care who he is because he really sucked) and talks about their different ways of solving the crime, while constantly being cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his buttocks. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old b-movie of this type, and I've seen some real head sleepers. Oh, and the butler didn't. because there wasn't a butler. But watch the man closest to a butler. There you go. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
