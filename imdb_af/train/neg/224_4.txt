The worst thing about Crush is not that it is very bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it is not even so bad that the camera work could be better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that hope you have more to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and inexpensive rebuilding scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - don't miss it. <br /> <br /> I myself am not exactly excited to see the above things in a movie, and as a result, I had a very terrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can't make up for the rest. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time. <br /> <br />
