So far from week two of "The Only of Beauty" I am a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the plays are good, as long as we're just drama. <br /> <br I'm not sure how people can feel that this Fictional DRAMA is the actual coverage of the "Thatcher" years. It's good as a drama, but I feel the award-winning book is much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow-up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with "Things Can Only Get Better" end with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with the promise of a government that is full of sluggishness.
