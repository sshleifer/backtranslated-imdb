I'm a big, big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I love Stephen King a little less, but I like his work. <br /> <br /> That said, I had to love 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE RAILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I was eager to go. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's not the actor's fault. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie Cusack puts in the "man in a closed room" situation. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a BAD movie, but I can't call it. no good one either. It was a damn mess that combined moments of "ouch, it's just wrong" with moments of "ouch, it's just painful" and moments of "oh, now it's just a pity" with very little continuity connection between them. Eislin's dad appears once and there is no apparent connection with the rest of Mike's personal life that we see as he tries to survive the room. <br /> <br /> A previous presenter described the Olin / Enslin argument as worth looking at, and I agree very much. But unlike that, apart from some clever musical clues (the room makes Enslin a little fun, and gives him one chance to get out before the ants get fired. At what point does it give him the one hour countdown clock and the titular line of the carpenters "We just started.") It's mostly "things jump out to you when you least expect!" kind of horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends of my age while pinching each other while Jason Camp Crystal Lake bumps. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was "let's revive him from his most painful experiences" mindgaming, with "let's see the paintings in the spectacular ways" clich√© cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the actors what I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We never find the origin of evil. We never see the evil slain, though we can suspect it has been defeated. <br /> <br /> And the end was just a scary "What?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for it to come on the cable. I won't pay it as a matinee, but I feel a little briefly because I paid the opening evening prices for it.
