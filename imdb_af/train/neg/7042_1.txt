It must be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker film, it's rock bottom. The minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town (how original!) And the townspeople's attempts to fight them. Why don't they call outside help? Who knows? The battle scenes are of course false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it, but both have little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understandable). This movie is in the trash!
