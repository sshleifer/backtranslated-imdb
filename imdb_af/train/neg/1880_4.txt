Despite a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' movies, it was only about 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs of an old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but didn't know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers' character is sweet and funny, just can't keep 'Bake Baker'. While trying to make his partner, he constantly sabotaged her career. His character does not have the usual humor and elanence of the other films' Astaire characters. <br /> <br /> Worth watching for the songs and a good solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.
