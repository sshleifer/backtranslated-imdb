This "Debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I'm speechless". I tackled it today so I could see it tonight. I have high expectations, Now I cut out the cupboards and look for a rope so I can hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like, "It was nice to enjoy this movie." But this movie gives me nothing to work with. I know you're not supposed to place spoilers here without warning, but anyway, I'm going to "suck this movie" there I said it! They have to show this movie to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine-year-old cousin can make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C clamp in my old toolbox. I'll put it on the thumb of my left hand and increase it until the pain wipes out the memory of what my eyes are. I could only tap on this VHS, but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead. I can wash with soap, but I'm afraid I'll never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. Mike
