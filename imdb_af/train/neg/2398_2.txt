As a fan of movies like "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane", I saw it because it was favorably mentioned in the context of real comedies and satires like those mentioned above. Well, wrong conclusion! <br /> <br /> Not only is it not funny, it hurts you because it is not bad in a shocking, fun way but in a very bad way. It's bad. The script does not contain a single funny line that is rather in the way when you try to entertain your audience with humor. <br /> <br /> Adam Arkin's speech restriction is probably the most boring thing in this movie. Yet this cruelty of nature does not avoid him throughout the film and he has a hard time not watching the camera. This amateur without charisma fits the constant continuity errors and bumbling along the story - if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, another night watchman, who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a few Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good. In the few lines he gave. I'm not easily scared of bad comedies, so I watched every 5 minutes or so and looked for all the quasi-jokes. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually kind of a comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over. - He does literally: Begin 75 minutes in the movie he is in every scene. But it's too little, too late. <br /> <br /> When movies are trying to trick you into believing their lack of professionalism, this is why you like to have them because they have the right intentions, they remind me of pupils who didn't for an exam. In those cases, you must remain strict and the grade must be an 'F'. (But don't pretend to be a teacher. It's a profession with a respectability between politicians and child molester). <br /> <br /> If you're actually looking for a similar schlocky horror / scifi movie that is fun to watch and contains jokes, try "Man with the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or look at Sunshine / Core if you prefer the modern, hard level SciFi Schlock. It is equally funny, though involuntary.
