To be cruel honest ... I looked at Love. That's why I <br /> <br /> gave it 1/10 stars because of its spectacular <br /> <br /> story / filming / acting / everything. This movie was a RIOT to watch. If <br /> <br /> you enjoy watching bad movies to make fun of them, you will <br /> <br /> really get a kick from Severed. <br /> <br /> The story really doesn't matter, it involves a guy who is naked and has a sword and walks around to behead arbitrarily. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural twist ... no one ever sees him do it. <br /> <br /> Even when he walks in a very memorable scene in a nightclub and <br /> <br /> no one sees it. <br /> <br /> Divorced doesn't just look like being filmed on video - it was <br /> <br /> filmed on someone's home camcorder. The filmmakers have <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> kept together in some scenes. But usually you can't <br /> <br /> hear the actors ... you can't understand what they are doing, and you laugh <br /> <br /> when the next vicitm has won his pumpkin from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Support movies like this - they are a hoot and <br /> <br /> a holar!
