Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / Serial Killer who owns the "First Power": even after being trapped by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and running in the gas chamber, he can move his spirit from body to body. body and remains the will to kill. With the help of the handsome psychologist Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G.'s half-sister), he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably has some possibilities, I think, but ultimately "The First Power" suffers from routine research and film-making. It's nothing we haven't seen before, sometimes better done. There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More to the point, it's not very exciting and it's definitely not scary. Phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails, cynical cop stereotype, and Griffith doesn't look very hard; best player is probably the distinctive Kober, who does his best to be highly creepy. <br /> <br /> The climax is quite stupid and the end is very poor. <br /> <br /> Not really even acceptable to regard as an average movie of its kind, so: <br /> <br /> 4/10
