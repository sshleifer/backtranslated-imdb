I almost never commented on movies, but I saw the 5 glowing reviews of this "movie" and decided to weigh in my own review. An instructor of mine received this film in the post, mixed with his Academy Showers (AMPAS, also the guys on the Oscars vote) and was so cursed with how terribly this movie was built, that he brought it into our class have to demonstrate to us how not to put a movie together. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot, the screens are terrible, terribly edited (often using faux "24" style picture-in-picture techniques), and the performances (especially the lead, which even fails acting like a bad actress) is mostly stupid. Somebody really failed to understand the point of an introduction, namely, setting up the plot. There is no setup! Halfway through the movie I and the rest of the class didn't know what this movie was about. The opening collar that puts some kind of murder is never addressed, and now that I think about it, it was possible to be a flashy forward. The rest of the movie is a jump back, but it cuts it out of the scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really go on. At least this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own movie capability.
