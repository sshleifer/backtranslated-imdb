Pier Paolo Pasolini, or Pee-pee-pee, as I choose to call him (because of his love of showing male genitals), is perhaps the most overstated European Marxist director - and they're thick on the ground. How anyone can see "art" in this messy, cheap sex-skirt fusion is out of my mind. Some of the "stories" here could have come straight out of a soft core film, and I don't even refer to the nudity, but the simplistic and banal, often pointless stories. Anyone who enjoys this relatively observable but stupid stupidity should really sink his teeth into the "German-70 series" Der Schulmaedchenreport "series, as it looks like Decameron looks like me. <br /> <br /> The movie is sloppy at almost all levels, from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1. Editing: An example: at 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds there is a trailing scene that is set in the wrong place quite clearly It is supposed to be posted about a minute later, but I think Pasolini has hired upgraded editors, who have little time for the "fine details" of movies. to say that it was deliberately placed there - which I doubt very much, moreover, even if it was true, it would be even worse, because that story gets absolutely nothing to make it harder (not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's broken-form movies ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. Pee's fans (all 8 of them) proudly state that 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are not actors? Or are they Martians? Sure, many actors have sub-par IQs, but it means we should treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors have used and succeeded amateurs (such as Alan Parker or De Niro), so why are PPP's amateurs so horrible in his movies? The answer is frightening again. Pasolini is sloppy in everything, and this includes getting as many as possible from his toothless amateurs. He is a lazy director, an IMperfectionist if you like. The anti-Kubrick, I suppose ... Pee-pee-pee's main goal when it should definitely have been to find as many toothless old people as possible (and young men who are to his liking). In Pasolini's world, there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's all good and fine to make them toothless, but try to perform at least semi-decent performances from these inexperienced neo-shooters, otherwise you yourself are an amateur - an amateur director, in Pasolini's case. Whether or not 3P-0 was unable to give this performance or just didn't care, doesn't change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he didn't even see the horrible acting?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. The synchronization. If 3P-0 feels the microphone is too much trouble when recording a movie, it should at least have a joint effort in the after-production, ie telling all these bum actors their lines in the studio, so our viewers should not look at the mouth, while the elusive dialogue elsewhere drives the movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of understanding. We have close to a dozen stories that are not meaningfully linked. Some are anti-church (more about this later), while some are merely sex yarns, it's cheap male (sometimes gay) fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else. The stories and characters are not amusing (if at all) at an intelligent level, but at the basic level. 10-year-old children can laugh here ... And there is nothing wrong with that, but do not call it elevated, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. Due to point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories. It speaks for itself. Pee-pee-pee could have arranged the order in any other way, and we would have had exactly the same movie. It also means that you can feel free to start from the middle, then go back to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is like a bowl of spaghetti: when you start eating, you can start any wire you want, it doesn't make any difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The futility of the stories' resolutions. Most stories end with a cheap gag / joke, that is, a few dumb dumb punchlines straight out of a porn comic book, while some stories don't even have a conclusion: they just don't end. Finito. In the best case, the stories are viewable semi-anecdotes, hardly any deeper meaning there - unless you find "deep" meanings in a porn. Of course, there is nothing easier than searching and finding "meaning" where there is an absence. That's why even a hardcore porn movie can be filmed endlessly. It's easy and fun. Try it, oh you 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> As for church bases ... Some viewers are all excited about his attack on Catholicism and what not. In principle, this is all good and good. After all, I am an atheist myself - but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like the pot that calls the kettle black. A Marxist criticism of the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he get the nerve? Moreover, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his proud and self-righteous attitude was not justified. Marxists are believers: they have simply replaced the accepted God with the idea of ​​a Utopia, which is just another supernatural imaginary fantasy. That's why I can't get excited about PPP's anti-religion antics. <br /> <br /> This sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolini and says pretentiously: "I wonder ... Why does an artwork produce when it's just nice to dream about It?" He didn't actually refer to this foolish little movie as art, was he ...? If he - the poor deceived man - was, I have to wonder why he didn't just make it dream, and didn't make all the bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Want me modified Bergman movie captions? Email me.
