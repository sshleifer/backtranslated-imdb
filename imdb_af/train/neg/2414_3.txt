I saw this movie on the shelf under "new releases" and found the idea of ​​a hip hop zombie movie, too interesting to succeed. That's how it was billed on the box, and I thought to myself, "What a great idea!" There is also a "Welcome to Oakland" sign on the cover. How can I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted as long as the opening theme. Non-hip hop music or hip hop culture also played a major role in the movie. After living in Oakland myself, I know there are many aspiring hip hop artists, so the low budget of this movie was no excuse not to have an appropriate soundtrack. Any number of struggling artists would have taken the opportunity to contribute to this movie. Why the Quiroz brothers didn't use this benefit is beyond me. <br /> <br /> After the movie started rolling, it was a completely typical zombie movie with a role that just as black and Latino became. You might think it would put an unusual slope on the movie ... but it didn't. Somehow, the Quiroz Brothers' vision of "urban culture" is somehow confronted by an F-bomb in every line in the movie. The quick fire using the word "fuck" is probably this movie's most distinctive feature; There were some lines containing the word three or four times, and no line contained it at least once. I'm not swearing about a movie at all, but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas from the writers (including the Quiroz brothers), and the writing was generally poor . br /> <br /> In general, the movie was a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a real "urban culture" zombie girl, but "Hood of the Living Dead" does not deliver on that score. The characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else. There was no clear smell to the movie. It's just another low budget with a low budget, with bad plays, loops writing, amateur direction, mere cinematography, a cheap soundtrack and nothing recommended.
