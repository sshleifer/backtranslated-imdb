Granted, I'm not the expert of the scary my partner is, but a well-composed, clever movie is worth it. My shortcuts, in brief: <br /> <br /> - Dialogue is often poor and sometimes incredible of the given character. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable acting. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never caught fire. <br /> <br /> The authors have picked pieces of choice from half a dozen mainstream movies, thrown into a kettle, not nearly enough, and trying to give our bad juice, the resulting mess, already. /> <br /> Long and short, while not quite awful, it was definitely not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
