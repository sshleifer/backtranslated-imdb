Gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. But not the bad kind of movies. This one is so awful it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly does not have a profitable career in acting. He must go back to gymnastics. But who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk, the rocky horse or the five minutes behind the scene through the town of crazies. I don't think it was meant to be so bad, but who can tell it. It is not art, but if you want something that is nice and soft, it will be a good conversation, rent gymakta. For an evening of fun.
