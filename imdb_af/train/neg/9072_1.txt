This movie has no plot and no focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a bang, stupid comedy, but the authors have no idea what the movie is about. Even the title doesn't go with the movie. It had to be called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and no one cares about what happens to them! The maid's roommate character (from that 70's Show) was the only person worth watching. She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in. The others need to make sure their own college diplomas are in the job, as they need a different profession than action.
