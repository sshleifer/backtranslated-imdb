Nice attempt and good ideas (deliverance from the prostitute, people helping each other ...) but a poor result ... The director obviously tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by creating an atmosphere that supposed to image Viet Nam ... The only problem is that this Vietnam is long gone and when the smell of green papaya has had a historical backdrop ... try to produce this kind of atmosphere (muted noises and the slow pace of life ... on modern days leaves a feeling of fake. Apart from that, quickly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome is too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action is in Saigon or Da Nang because this is where ex-navy Harvey Keitel was probably stationed during the war ... But speaking in Southern Vietnam nobody or very few people with the cut. Northern accent displayed by the actors. Seriously strange even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old leper poet ... very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write extensive, advanced Vietnamese poetry ... even more questionable ... <br /> <br />
