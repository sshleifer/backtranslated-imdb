It was so lame that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway through. It was so poor, I couldn't even give enough attention to tell you how far I made it. Although I really wanted to believe that the portrayal of the young Carlito would be somewhat different, I couldn't buy it. I really don't treasure the actors, because I think it was the writing that fell flat. I learned to laugh a few times, but I don't think the lines were meant to be funny. <br /> <br /> It's just savings, I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I just did for the original. This is one of the cases where they had to leave the classic alone.
