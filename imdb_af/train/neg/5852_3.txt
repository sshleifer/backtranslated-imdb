Bradford Dillman plays a scientist waking up one morning in the midst of a bloody crime scene; With a partial memory loss (or "global amnesia", which claims one character to be defined as elective memory loss), the scientist finds a private detective in the phonebook hoping to re-focus his life. Abhorrent concoction very loosely based on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too racial for television - which added drugs and hippies to the mix - that NBC initially refused to air it, and how was this low budget left in the theaters. Director James Goldstone gets freaky with the hyper-kinetic visual and camera tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery goes wild with the zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, their recognition-colorful gimmicks cannot cover the weaknesses of this updated plot, and the acting is unfortunate. Dillman, under pressure to remember the events of that particular night, goes through an actor's seminar of tics, tribes, nostrils and crazy half-stroke, while the dialogue is spread like: "Dream ... a dream ... drugs ... yes, drugs ... it sounds ... bells ... help! "As a fellow scientist with a Cheshire Cat smile, Pat Hingle has almost earned Dillman in the Grand Thespian section of everyone in baby talk to talk, like a middle-aged peacock and his mouth reversed in anxiety. Hope Lange's scientific / love interest is briefly given, but not before she screams to careless lovers. Dillman: "What should I do, monkeys talk to Man? I want you!" This is a spicy "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 of ****
