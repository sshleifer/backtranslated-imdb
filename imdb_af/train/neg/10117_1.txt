Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this Gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it looked like the movie for my mood. I brought it home and brought it home. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the B Horror movie I had in mind. It was much worse. I wanted to have a bad movie, but what I got did not know that the crap was like this among humans. This movie looked like a 5 year old wrote it and really learned it. <br /> <br /> I am a prospective director and this movie made me so crazy that someone outside of the city actually pays this man. direct movies. He must work at a rubbish dump where he belongs, where he belongs. <br /> <br /> If you are considering buying or buying it. I will tell you the same thing that I will tell someone who is ready to commit suicide. "Don't do this, it's not so!" I really have nothing nice to say about this movie. Don't do it!
