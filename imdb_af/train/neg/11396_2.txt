The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, eventually makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages it with enough humor to see it. Just scarce. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wood, the story is paper-thin and the actors can't fall from a grocery store. Put it all together and you have a pulsating ball coating for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is so much. Chew for 90 minutes and you have a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
