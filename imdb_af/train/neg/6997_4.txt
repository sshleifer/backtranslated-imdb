I saw it with an increasing sense of discomfort. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these particular people in their attempt to escape from Devils Island? And what did he do in the first place? I mean, I know God works in mysterious ways, but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find salvation, forgiveness, and heart changes in such a godly place. Anyway, it's almost a similar movie. Whatever Gable had with charm, is lacking in this portrait of a thorough selfish man. Crawford is as engaging as ever, it was not for me at all and the whole look of the movie makes it look like it was made 10 years earlier. Compared to contemporary films such as "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", it seems prehistoric.
