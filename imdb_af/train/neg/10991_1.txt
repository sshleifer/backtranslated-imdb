My brother is an avid DVD collector. He looked at the cover once (two models on toilets) and added it to his collection. I stayed with him to see what was probably the most cringeable movie (I used the term loosely). I felt compelled to go through. I didn't dare make eye contact with my brother. He must have cursed the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in one scene. The "filmmaker" has decided to show every recording of (about four in total) throughout the film. In fact, the whole movie follows a lot this pack. The fact that the DVD contains alien imagery was a shock. (However, I went to sleep without looking at it). No surprise, I found this disc behind the TV a week later.
