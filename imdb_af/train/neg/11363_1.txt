This movie is advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. When we were at the Kinnepolis plywood, our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad is this movie! This is a Hollywood-style movie about a movie in a movie. Shades show so clearly that we're not ready to produce a great Hollywood movie. I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good writing. And the writing is a nightmare. As my subject line says, it's nothing, and then walked. You can only watch the television without really seeing anything. That was the feeling we had when we saw shades. Shades are a LARGE PRODUCTION !!!
