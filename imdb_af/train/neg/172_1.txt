Back to the cabin at the lake, in no way stand on the original. With just one main character (Stanley) coming back for the pursuit, the movie is not even the 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the first movie, the story line and acting was really good, but it's one movie I will never see again. It's basically similar to what the sequals for Urban Legends and Blair Witch were, but with much worse acting. I personally saw better in daily soap operas, it's so sad that you just have to laugh. I, by no means, recommend this movie to anyone, as it will only detract from the first.
