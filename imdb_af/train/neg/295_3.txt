I did this movie because I worked at a movie shop, so I got free rentals. It came, and the cover made it look good. Hot chick, wear a weapon, okay, I'll watch it. <br /> <br /> O man, bad move. It was so awful, I watched half of the movie to watch the nudity quickly, which was little. I think maybe three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Cheesy dialogue, scratched violence, bad excuses of characters. I feel bad about downloading this movie because I know it's made on a cheap budget, but it was also "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
