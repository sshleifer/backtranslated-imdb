This relentless film is a piece of shit and sows like the full house repetitions. For all the people who want to see a wonderful, exciting and cool horror movie, they shouldn't even think about the bunch of sensible work. An F to my opinion. I have one question, what do they think? Let's make a list: 1) Bad Writing 2) Bad Writing 3) Bad Writing 4) Bad Acting 5) Bad Writing and finally, but not least, bad writing. I mean, I'm not like grumbling over every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This movie must be banned in a box, locked and sunk into the sea. Please do not do this again, please, please, please !!
