Good actors and good performances cannot achieve a useless script, a bad dialogue, and behavioral patterns that are not cared for. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, just a few who do not suffer for any particular reason, teach us nothing and do not even entertain.
