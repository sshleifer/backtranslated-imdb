Angry Race is a very funny slasher flick that is unfortunately not good. The start of the movie looks promising, but overall it's a disaster. The dialogue is pretty bad but not as bad as the scene. The play is brutal and unbearable. the characters render lines terrible and even if they are deliberate, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the victims are innovative, but it took far too long to get them. After about half an hour through the movie we get the first death (except in the beginning) and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes. The movie then becomes a ghost with ridiculous characters, unrealistic karate such as battles, and a scene in which a man gets his intestines out of his sack. None of the things are funny, it's just ridiculous. The film then becomes ultra greedy and ultra pointless. Most characters are even clicked for scraper standards and are as solid as but 5 days on the counter. Eternity Race is not even laughable, so it fails in its main task. Look at Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just before Dawn, or see no harm to a real victim.
