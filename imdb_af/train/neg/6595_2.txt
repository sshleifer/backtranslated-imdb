I recorded this film in the hotel room to leave my kids the morning we were away to go home, because I packed all their toys. (Toddlers don't like watching "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View".) My four-year-old found one scene funny, but told me the rest is too "too stupid". It's a FOURTH OLD, people. Anyone older than nine will want to kill their television, rather than make it play. <br /> <br /> To say this movie is bad like saying the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly this "movie" is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the writing is pathetically unfunny. Since it's supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can't even laugh the worst of the movie can make it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with a strange fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are terrible. I didn't watch a real Laurel and Hardy movie, but I KNOW it should be better than that. What's the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: derivative garbage. Avoid at all costs unless you have a freaky Bronson Pinchot fetish. 10/02
