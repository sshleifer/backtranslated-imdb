Okay, I only saw this movie a few weeks ago at 9:00 on Cinemax and thought it would be award-winning, boy was I about it. This movie bit the big one. I mean, the mother of the monsters just shows her true form at the end of the movie. I'm going "That's it? Why doesn't she briefly show it a bit more earlier in the movie." The plot is the mother and son feast on the blood of young women. If it doesn't get better if they just go on, you know, a deadly spree killing like a few young women then found out the sheriff or a policeman and in the way gets a way to kill the monsters , save the young woman / woman and killed 1 or 2 people in the process? I think that would be much better that way. It also sucks because the boy is the main character and he is first killed. Why not get rid of the mother first? Plus, how did she get the power to end the movie when she started killing people? She said she was too weak. What was Stephen wrong about this time? I can never be the actor on any film by any actor, but they try their best. If it wasn't good, I would have given this movie 1/10. 10/03.
