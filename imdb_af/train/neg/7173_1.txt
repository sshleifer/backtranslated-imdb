I hate plane crash movies ... All of them! In fact, I hate everyone with a passion! First, they are cheap and have no workmanship! Secondly, they insult the airline industry and tell the audience that all the planes are ... FALL OUT FROM THE SKY AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why am I going to such a movie? It could be with any of us and with worse effects than those of the characters in the movie ... which is the only cold aspect of an airline disaster like this. I hate this movie because it's like all 50 million stupid-ass plane chaos movies for it! Release is like everyone else: nothing more than boredom before the dramatic plays of the claws are rushed. <br /> <br /> First, we have the same death on this flying death: The Cleaver esquire family of three, the yuppie baastard, and the pilot of a pilot, completed with a big blonde hairstyle from 1987 to somebody what is the least scared! <br /> <br /> My second gripe is that it should not be a full-length movie, but a documentary explaining everything about the Air Canada Gimbli Glider incident, aka "Freefall" for safety. /> <br /> My third and final grip is with all the airline movies of this caliber (with the exception of fearless). Why did the male driver ask the passengers to remove shoes? (I can understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but c'mon!) As it goes, they make them safer than they are now! This plane if they (the passengers) didn't know better, knew they were going to land in. Why force 100 injured people into a rubber drive, which can peel the skin and bleed on impact just to walk into their stocking feet on a debris! Does it make sense to anyone? <br /> <br /> Fearless and hit ABC series "Lost" had more depth and realism on air strikes than just "airplane errors - people become panic-stewards wandering assholes-level lands without wheels in field people without shoes and jackets, etc. The same old shit from Airport 1975! Freefall was so typical of an airplane movie that I almost expected to see if Charlton Heston or Peter Graves had passed the damn passenger cabin in the dam any moment. see how these poorly-activated characters go back to normality instead of people staying amid the imminent tragedy facing them? Typical moronic life movie! Cheap and Dumb! <br /> <br /> The director of "Freefall "stick to cheap-made-for-TV movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenage children who do drugs and have marital problems. hack! Why should we put the hearing through the audience for more than half an hour is airport wannabe rehash. I hope God doesn't make them e more pilot movies like this. If it were "lost" like the ABC series, it would be something to watch. But it is completely crap and then some. Stop changing every plane crash into "1975 Airport"! It's not "Airport", it's cheap pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie or any made-to-TV air disaster movie to anyone, not even my worst enemies.
