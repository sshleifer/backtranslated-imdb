One day some bad people made a movie about a man who shot in space, who had to go to Saturn, but only after some footage of sunburn, and then he had a nosebleed and before you know it , he goes to a hospital in a hospital setting and then an overweight nurse with a poor patient comes in and is eaten by the man, who is supposed to melt all over the place, but never loses mass and then NASA, or at least one man at NASA, is upset about it and calls on another man to hunt him, but the man who sent them to hunt the melting man must go home and have soup first, and his strange wife forgets the crackers, so he can't have crackers, and then he has to go out and search for the melting man with a Geiger counter, and it doesn't really work, so he actually only follows the half-way route bodies, And then there's something about a sheriff and two ugly old people in a lemon grove, and a woman with a meat biker, a kind of industrial plant with fast-paced security guards, and since I can't tell you how the movies end, I can only say that Jonathan Demme is somewhere with a guy with the stupid name of Burr DeBenning, and if There is some justice in the world that is all related to this movie, has died a terrible, violent death and could no longer make movies, and the world has never lived the end!
