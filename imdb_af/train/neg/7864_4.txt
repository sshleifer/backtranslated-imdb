The Hills has eyes II that you would expect to be and nothing more. Of course, it's not going to be an Oscar-nominated movie, it's just pure entertainment that you can only lose for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees struggling against the infamous mutated hillbillies on their last day of desert training. It's just those who fight through the whole movie. It involves a lot of violence (it's basically the whole movie), as blood and intestines are constantly moving around the whole thing and also a relentless graphic rape scene. shock the audience. <br /> <br /> I'll give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that alone. Although even then I watched my watch more and more while the movie started, as it began to drag because it continued to try to shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jumping just to make sure the audience was up. The Hills has eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass time when you're bored, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
