I am one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and have just seen it, the episode it all started on British Channel 5. It is fascinating to think that jumped out of this so-so movie and I can I just wonder who saw the massive potential of "Columbo" and added all the little touches that made it such a wonderful and classic series. That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassment of the final episode and the enchanting British episode). If Columbo was made according to the original 'pilot', it would certainly not last very long, or be watched and loved worldwide. In this film Lt Columbo is cleverly dressed, a regular car driver, a partner, does not talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as very aggressive. There is also none of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and the "villain". Wait, but just for the novelty to see Columbo start.
