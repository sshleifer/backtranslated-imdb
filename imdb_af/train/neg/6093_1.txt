It must be the WORST movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD and it didn't work. Well, the DVD worked well. It's just the movie, and it's really so bad that I don't think the actors have worked since then. There is no real plot to speak of and no real terror. The production values ​​are even for a low budget movie, with some outside screens difficult to hear due to wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was so bad a movie that a viewer could think was going to change to a porn if they didn't know better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the funny film, which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to watch 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As far as DVD marketing is concerned, I feel deeply deceived. I mean to read the back, I expected it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He chose his victims. He chose his nose. He changed into a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. Also, the case claims that it is digitally mastered again, I would like to see it, the pressure is so granular that you can use it as sandpaper. The case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie, IN WHAT AWAY, Disgusting Production, Acting. <br /> <br /> This movie show welcomes it in the first five minutes (if you are considering buying it, I would say buy "bad taste" instead, it's a much better movie and funny, it also includes Peter Jackson, the director of the LOTR. <br /> <br /> By the way, if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, please write here if i want to know, pure to find out if there is a worse movie there, or if someone in this movie ever bother to learn to act
