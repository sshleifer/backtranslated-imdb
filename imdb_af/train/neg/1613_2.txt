With Che (2008) completing his relatively short Australian theater career (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can innocently join both hosts of At The Movies to launch Steven Soderbergh. <Br /> <br /> It is usually satisfying to look at a film director who changes his style / subject, but Soderbergh's most recent stinker, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacks a story, and so narrative (and editing?) suddenly looks like Soderbergh's biggest challenge. Strange, after 20 years in the business. He was probably never very good at the story, it just hidden well in "edgy" projects. <br /> <br /> None of these excuses make him this current, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che (not even) are a whole". <br /> <br /> Epic biopies in name only, qualify Che (2008) hardly as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, because the Soderbergh's 4.5-hour dirge is just outside its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiveness of Australia's At The Movies duo, noted Soderbergh's recurring wastage of (HD digital storage): "You're in the woods ... you're in the forest ... you are in the woods ... ". I'm also surprised. Soderbergh hasn't given us a 2.5 hours of it between his existing two parts, as he still left massive pieces of Che's "revolutionary" life out! <br /> <br /> For a biopsy of an important but notorious historical figure, Soderbergh alienates his audience by <br /> <br /> 1 unpredictable if he doesn't deliberately offend it. never provide most of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. Setting unreasonable movie lengths with mere dullard repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. Ignore both true afterwards and a story of events; <br /> <br /> 4. Rare development of an idea, or a character; <br /> <br /> 5. Remaining claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. Disregard proper context for scenes --- whatever we get, is stimulated in disruptive time increases; <br /> <br /> 7. Linguistically disturbs all audiences (even Spanish speakers will be confused by the turbulent exhibitions in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. Target its major in one dimension white. Why, at this late stage? The T-shirt franchise is a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen who wrote their script exclusively on Guevara's memoirs. So, like a poor student who only read ONE of his assigned texts for his assignment, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The audience is imprisoned within the same limited knowledge, scenery and circumstances of the "revolutionary", but it does not cause our sympathy. Instead, we start that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to make his audiences the same as the Latino farmers at the time". But these are the SAME illiterate Latino farmers who sold the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to compare with them and keep us equally spiritually captive? Such hearing aid should have a purpose. <br /> <br /> Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but it is literally sensible with its repetitive forest bashing, misery, and lack of variety or character bows. DelToro's Che has no chance of growing as a person struggling to educate his own poorly-disciplined troops. The only command is the humor like Che with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionary" trade. Some of them have self-control over local farmers or food. We definitely get no insight into what caused the conditions or strategic analysis of their guerrilla uprising, as it was. <br /> <br /> Part2's immaculate countdown remains terribly episodic: again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. So even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and confusing. Any selected events are depicted minimally and Latino-centric. Part 1 interviews are being replaced by timely meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials promising the CIA intervention (!). <br /> <br /> The rest of Part2's "woods" and day-to-night blue filter only worsen the audience until they look at the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro has over-felt the frustration of many non-American Latin on how to never get a true, unashamed history of Che's exploitation in their own countries. If foreign governments do not want to give their people a free press for any reason, then one can see how a popular American indigenous producer can exercise to lure the non-well-read ("I can't be can read or write, but I am NOT illiterate! "- cf.The Inspector General (1949) to their own local theaters. The film's obvious neglects and coarse over-simplifications strongly suggest that it's only on the concepts of the less-informed WHO, who speaks another small English. If they did, they would have already read home topic on the topic and criticized the relevant social issues - learn the lessons of history as they belong. <br /> <br /> Such insights are exactly what societies still need - and not just the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South America - yet what Che (2008) happily fails to deliver. Soderbergh buries his lead because he is poor on narration. I'm gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew it. It was 44 years old, afterwards by Guevara was very popular: that's what I was about to see this movie, but the director robbed us deadly. <br /> <br /> David Stratton writes in The Australian (Oct. 03, 2009) noted that Part2 was "uneven", and Part2 actually "goes down quickly", "watch Che's final campaign in Bolivia in ominous detail ", which" feel almost unbearably slow and uncomfortable ". <br /> <br /> Che: The Guerilla aka Part2 is definitely no travel record for Bolivia, and it paints a picture of misery and atavism. The entire second half is left only by the mentioned humor and the dramatic - yet tragic - capturing and performance of the film's subject. <br /> <br /> The rest of this interminable cinema is just confusing, annoying misery - shocking, for a Soderbergh movie, at all costs. It is bound to break the hearts of all who even know a smattering on the subject. (2/10)
