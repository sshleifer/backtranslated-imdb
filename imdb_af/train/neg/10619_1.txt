... but a lousy movie. As Maltin says, it was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... too serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about old people who occupy the bodies of young children to bring about immortality) ... the movie is talking everything talking talking talking talking talking about the same things over and over. I actually killed several times! The movie is so boring! The towed bunnies through this with the only exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but it was probably a loving love for both (they often complained that horror movies are too violent ... well, it has NO violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... it'll let you sleep!
