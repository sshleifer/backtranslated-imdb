This is the kind of thing that just excites the movie eggheads. In fact, Feierstein's Flex Crush will know that Real Men has nothing to do with Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Did we all forget De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or all that Hitchcock has? <br /> <br /> So, all we get is the elaborate metaphor of youths like Truffaut, who has all his spare time in the film, which disrupts the discipline of the school hall, is accused of plagiarism (the many small theft), and finally social restrictions escape to make their own movie. Sorry ... it was done too many times because it mattered.
