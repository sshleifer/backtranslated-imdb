Imagine turning the American anthem into a cartoon. Throw some cute animals, some horrible words and some roller skates and you'll find yourself with almost an exact replica of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember when I was younger; I rented my mother from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not bad, it is just that any Marxist who is watching must definitely complain. <br /> <br /> If you don't like America, you won't like this movie.
