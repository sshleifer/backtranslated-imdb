Guy Ritchie's noble attempt is defeated, beaten, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spat, beaten, sodomized, and abused and abandoned by Madonna's terrible display for death. Her acting was reminiscent of a graduate of the Al Gore School of Dramatic and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie made a somewhat noble effort to reaffirm it, and if you exclude ALL the scenes his wife was in, it's at best a fair movie. I think the best acting work ever, Guy should be comforted with his wife that her performance was good enough not to shoot again. If you have an opportunity to see if you have clipped your mouthpiece for 89 minutes, go for the extensive pedicure.
