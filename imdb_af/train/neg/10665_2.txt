About three minutes into this thing, I quickly started moving forward, just below the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes I was done and wish I could get my money back from the rental shop. The people who write these movies must be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys always get in the car with the bomb activated by the good man's remote! So it's been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! To add insult to injury, the "turn" at the end was so formative that it could have been out of action for the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was good, but he had to concentrate on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - run away! Run away!
