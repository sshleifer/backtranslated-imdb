* Possible Spoiler * <br /> <br /> "Back to Cabin by the Lake" is a useless movie. The acting wasn't good and the plot wasn't even interesting at all. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a great TV movie. The successor was not. Judd Nelson was very good at the first film and has much more in his character than placed in it. It was as if he was not even interested in the successor. His performance was good, but it could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest of the movie, because I don't even think it's worth mentioning. But I'll do it. Alison's character is not even shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly she's the center of attention alongside Stanley Caldwell. The role did not make sense and it had to be devised a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely horrible. Her acting was pretty decent and the decisive people had to look at someone else, anyone else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. He apparently had a goal to be there, but his death didn't seem to be necessary. The action for this role was good, nothing good, but better than Salem. <br /> <br /> The plot was actually in common when thinking about it. Stanley, supposedly dead, sets off on the set of 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his screenplay. He stumbled upon the director and in a short time the director died and Stanley managed the show. Yes, from now on, the crew will only bring this stranger into the picture and end the film and know nothing about him. There are a few murders, not many, and the one shown is ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set explodes while a scene is filmed. Another character is chewed by a motor boat. And one gets entangled in a plant before it drowns. These writers had to be very excited. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way it changed from the low budget back to normal has become very annoying. The new cabin at the lake was also badly created. We are not shown, but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It just worked in the first movie because we showed the room much more, but it didn't work in this one. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them, except for a few, had no reason to be there. The play of what was shown was really bad and ... they just didn't have a purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Back to the cabin at the lake" is a successor pick from where the first walked away. 'Cabin by the Lake' I can take, but it just wasn't impressive. Judd Nelson had to avoid this one and so should you. It's nothing like the first and it went way too slowly. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag for the second. Not to mention that the writing was terrible. Just put it on if you need help sleeping. <br /> <br /> So, we see Stanley killing death and still living alive and well. In the way he speaks, it sounds like there might be a possible third installment for a movie only in itself. Keep on entering successors and we can be good! <br /> <br /> (Didn't the filmmakers realize they showed us how to film the screens of the first one? They were all in a tank, never revealing the secrets of filming.) <br /> <br />
