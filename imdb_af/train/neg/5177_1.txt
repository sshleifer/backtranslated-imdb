It's so bad, so very bad. The acting is the biggest joke in history. Don't even bother to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was just as disappointing as in the beginning. I don't understand people's taste, I'm a horror movie and I'm not demanding, but I HAVE A LIMITED! Perhaps it was a quarter of a star better than the start of The Hoast, but that's it. So I recommend you not waste the 15 minutes you will be able to see. I mean the acting is better done by monkeys. And the big brother with the parental role is just terrible. Don't they have to pay characters in C movies? No, I have to say it's not the first time I think a horror movie is bad, but it's absolutely one in my ten movies and it'll be places with a Vampire Portrait, Cabin at the Lake, The Hoast!
