Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who is also director), an aging player, wins a beautiful young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (nice but not talented Brooke Shields). Together, the unlikely pair (of course) began a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there really is no need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It's just not there. The acting is also very poor. It was quite a surprise given that Peter Fonda was in the prospect. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something interesting in this movie, look at the beautiful scenery. and some good looks from a young Brooke Shields. However, her character is so annoying (especially at the beginning) and stupid, that she never gets so sexy or attractive. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt anything that can be made more of this. I wonder why Peter Fonda is the director and star in this movie. He even had to talk to his father (Henry Fonda) in a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, it was their only movie together. For example, could Henry not be in EASY RIDER? 10/03
