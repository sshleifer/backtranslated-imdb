It's a very strange movie ... I wasn't really sure what it was about. Some N London lowlifes find a dumb child in the forest they all believe is a kind of oracle and make them all in their own way, changing something about their lives usually ending in the disaster. The movie ends after about 90 minutes, so I feel dissatisfied, almost irritated by its futility. I didn't care about any of the characters. None of them get a chance to enchant themselves. <br /> <br /> What was the message? I become dull It was just too strange. What happens to Runner? Why does Emilio shoot the child? ... it made absolutely no sense, meaningless. Can anyone help me understand this mess of a movie?
