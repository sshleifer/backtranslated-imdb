Breinless film about a beautiful but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost immediately make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people trying to drop the items we see falling on the ocean floor during the opening credit line. Huge look directly to the video movie could have been so much better than not so interested in mainly good looks. Performances are useful and the plot is actually not bad, or the director and producers did not divert the plot to make sure we see many formal people in bathing suits (or in what I am the reason for the "unrated" moniker a few bare bare breasts). The movie never generates tension or rises above the level of a forgotten TV movie. If you are enrolled to see it, you will not pick your eyes, as the eye candy is enjoyable, but we really have to stop producers making movies that are excuses to have a paid holiday.
