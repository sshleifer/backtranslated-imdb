I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I saw Jacquet's previous movie (march of the penguins) and heard a very positive review of this one on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. Usually, this movie is terribly boring. Literally nothing happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both laughed because I could only dumb things like, "Well then come winter and then jump, and then there's an eagle and" a river and once it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and once again the fox babies "and so on. After about half an hour I started to sigh, yawn, throw my eyes, curse the reviewer at the radio station and hope it will soon be over. But the movie went over and over. When it finally ended, I sank so deep into my chair that I had to have a bit similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying part of the movie is (a) The girl, of course there is to give children to identify someone. She wears the same clothes throughout the film (one year), and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She's cute, no doubt about it. However, a movie about the scenery like this one would have done better without her everyday presence. I constantly hoped that she might be eaten by a bear, drowned in the river or something terrible. (b) The commentary by the girl's adult voice, which tells us nothing but insignificant, obvious, boring, excesses. (c) The music desperately lacking in desperation. When the girl happily jumps around, the music also jumps around. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music also becomes threatening. It reminded me of the very early days of movies, and was just too predictable to enjoy. Of course, many of the children who saw the movie with me obviously liked it, at least they got involved in some way. So, my warning only relates to adults: If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.
