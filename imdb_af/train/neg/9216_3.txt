Hoo boy, it was a real trial to come through. The DVD cover plastered Tom Hanks's cup and that is the only reason anyone would buy it. He looked about forty on the box, but the film was made in 1982. So he still does his Bosom Buddies and of course it is about forty pounds lighter. The plot is about a Dungeons and Dragons like a game that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a sequence of funny hats. Ooh, look, he has a yellow hard hat with a smuggle! Now he is dressed like a WWI pilot! It was a really horrible movie but in a bad way. A lot of veterinarians appear mostly as parents of the children. There is Anne (I'm Honey West, dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who look really hot. Jaws Mayor Murray Hamilton has an ungrateful role as a policeman. Wendy Crewson is the love interest for Hanks and a blonde man I've never seen before. There is a little poppy music here and there and absolutely no tension or feeling of danger or excitement. There is a monster who can only see Hanks, because he is, you know, nuts. The monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator's fame. A friend of mine got it from the transfer tray at MallWart and advised me to unload it in the trash without first looking at it, so of course I had to see if it was as bad as that. It was. The previous night I watched Apollo 13, so after that this movie was a bit of a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the bowl. Oh yes, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers, because of his despair, he goes home to recover and is visited by his friends. Hanks mother, a drunken Vera Miles, says he's getting along well, but if they go to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he's more than ever before. The end
