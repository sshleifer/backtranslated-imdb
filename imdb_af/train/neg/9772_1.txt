Just too many incidents of violence. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from one scene to another, and almost everyone breaks violence. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not one who is shocked by violence, and for me a movie without a fight in it has something missing. But, please, not one after the other. My reaction wasn't shock or horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is an overview of a story between the scenes of violence, but two thirds of the way through the movie I completely switched off and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If it's the best thing the filmmakers can do, they need to find something different with their unhappy lives, such as making shoes or posting.
