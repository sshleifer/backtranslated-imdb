I promised for a long time to NEVER see a movie that someone once was a regular member of Saturday Night Live. I did not rent "Corky Romano" but I was forced by my infallible good manners to watch it for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Mute, not funny. Faint, not hilarious. Bad, not good. It's in a nutshell everything I can say for this video.
