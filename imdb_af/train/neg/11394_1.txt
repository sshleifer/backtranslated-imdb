Oh, to cry out loud, it must be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and it is a pity that the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless, two-piece stupidity. While Sleafless in Seattle delivered the same amount of message, although on a subtler, slightly more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledge hammer and then continues it in your psyche for the next passing hour and a half. or so (and it's half an hour of my life, I'll never come back, thank you very much !!). It's bad enough that the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (actually I knew fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was nice enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays the annoying patience of a game, I had my best friend and I was irritated. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the Rockstar characters were not half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to see protagonists who have no idea about the choice in their lives, and feel they are nothing more than dolls to the fate and the whims of fate. How totally exhausting. I'm sure this movie is likely to be enjoyed by those who prefer not to get involved in the chaotic messiness to make more complex life choices and then live responsibly with the consequences. After all, here is a movie where our hero and heroine have always been happy after having had two other people's lives (namely their respective fianc√©e) devastation and misery, not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there. come. <br /> <br />
