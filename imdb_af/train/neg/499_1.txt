The Horror Channel does nothing but the erotic soft porn gothic flicks every night from 10pm to about 4 in the morning, but their 'fright' factor is very limited, if not at all. In fact, I'm sure I will win a multi-million pound lottery which is more scary than this channel offers. <br /> <br /> The Bloedsucker leads the dance deserves special mention, as I feel the undisputed low of a low-volume channel. I can't even begin to tell you how bad this movie is, but in order to complete the minimum 10 lines required by this site, I'll give it at least. <br /> <br /> First, the title is misleading. and does not match the action on the screen. In fact, the movie can also be called "Toothbrush" or "Wall Paper" for everything it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes. At least they have wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no blood suckers for miles and what's worse there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they made two different movies here. <br /> <br /> A more suitable title would have been, "Horny Italian Count, leading five people to a scary castle and making us foolish for ninety minutes." Yes, it fits better. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the doubles are frightening, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost like wood in his walk as he was in his character .... abysmal. /> <br /> The only rescue degrees of this movie are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in the fact that every single female character gets her kit off. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, send a wide birth away from this one. No vampires, no dance, no scenes of a brutal or abominable nature and no way on the earth of God. I'll ever see this one again. <br /> <br /> No word of lie, this movie can put your images for life.
