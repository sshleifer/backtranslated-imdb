ORCA isn't really bad, but it's not really Richard Harris's best hour. As a demented, Ahab-like fisherman, Harris gets a deadly game with a raging killer fishery after killing the whale's wife and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris. She screams a lot for him about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and end up somehow in the arctic struggle against the revengeful whale. There are no special effects to talk about, except what looks like a round mirror for a whale's eye. There are endless shots of Harris that are reflected in the eye so that the audience understands that the whale knows who he is. Above Derek, as one of Harris's crew has a particularly unpleasant run-in with the Orca and most supporting role-players, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, are also not doing well.
