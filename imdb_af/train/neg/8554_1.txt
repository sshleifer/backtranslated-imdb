The film was probably made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. I would suspect that conversation photos with big problems were difficult to make the transition from the silent era. However, this particular Zane Gray plot looks very poor. Also, Gary Cooper probably just learned to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable according to today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, not acceptable. Some of the actors did well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get the short end in these early Westerners. They have long lived on the land before the white man came, but according to the twisted history they had no right to defend themselves.
