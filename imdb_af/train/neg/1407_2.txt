After life is a miracle, I didn't expect much. It's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as, for example, Dolly Bell. Zavet is two hours of stupid antics with no story. Underground's wild and unbridled humor seems to have turned into pathetic buffooning. It seems that Kusturica has gradually gone downhill since it started life-fulfilling comedies, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I thought was great, but already has some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked so many of his early films, which is why it is particularly disappointing to see such a thing. Let's hope his next one will be great.
