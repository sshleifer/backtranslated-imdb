It is possible that a man named carriage could be made irreparable damage to the cutting chamber floor. Perhaps somebody will claim a director's cut, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to fill in cash in the spaghetti western market, leaving a lot of Americans left to fill the cast. out. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow, who both wrote and directed this role. <br /> <br /> Garner is always thrown as gambling throws because he is so good at playing them. But he played seriously and did well in movies like The Children's Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken out of his usual stereotype part. But a man named Sledge cannot be counted as one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the title role as Luther Sledge's notoriously high-priced ban on his head. After killing Tony Young in a salon, and Garner taking appropriate Eastwood style measures, he is followed by John Marley's salon. <br /> <br /> Marley's spending time in nearby territorial prison appears to be gold shipped. sit under lock and key in a resting place for the people who transport the stuff on a regular basis. Garner gets his gang together for a lift. <br /> <br /> Here's where the movie goes completely off the wall. Usually heist films show the main players go into a lot of methodical planning. Surely this was the case in The War Wagon who quoted other reviewers. But in this one Garner decides to jail as prisoner of the fake American Marshal Dennis Weaver and allow a jail at what time the gold will be robbed. <br /> <br /> It was just too much to swallow. If the gold was it, it was easy to do it long ago. But I will say to those who love the blood and at least of the Italian westerners, during that jailbreak there is enough for three movies. <br /> <br /> It's not the whole thing, of course, the outdoor stuff falls out and we have another gore fest ahead of the movie. But by that time the whole movie lost a lot of coherence. <br /> <br /> The big movie director of the Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for my life I can't find him in the movie. Perhaps a Donkey Serenade choir might have made it better. <br /> <br /> Couldn't have hurt anyone.
