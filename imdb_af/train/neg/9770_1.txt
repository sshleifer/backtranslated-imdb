This is the version that even hated the author, because they are such schemas. They gave it a "happy ending" and changed much of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharine. The "stage driver" is pretty good, I believe it originated, but everyone falls into the acting style of the 40's who really just position. The one great feature - the music. It has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth looking out for at a record store. Overall, I think the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is much better.
