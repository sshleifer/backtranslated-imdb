Crime BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; An Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. A forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good car hunt series, this movie looks almost purposeful. A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Unwanted laws and ethics of the Mafia Code make it difficult to trust someone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence break the same in exchange. It cannot be placed on the shelf with the right gangster epics. Just the look of the movie brings memories of the American driving-in prize. Even popular American actor Telly Savalas cannot increase the caliber of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also dies with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
