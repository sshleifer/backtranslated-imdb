An illegal immigrant resists the social support system that causes many consequences. Well filmed and performed even though the story is a bit forced, but the slow pacing really makes the conclusion. The sense of loss in the big city is effectively conveyed. The small person who is lost in great society is something we can all relate to, but I cannot endorse being out of this way.
