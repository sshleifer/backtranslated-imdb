No matter what someone tells you, there is a mere fact for the word "possession" in movie circles - like "what did you have to relieve this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does. This is when your head is clear and you are healthy to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> At many levels I tried to rationalize where this movie would entertain ... or even interest the average consumer. The star? The story? The unique idea? A girlfriend movie that will love kids with a dinosaur and a black woman? To my goodness! I'm sure when it was an idea, it looked good. But sometime in the course of development ... someone had to point out where the idea could not be translated into an entertainment that someone wants to see or pay ... unless they are deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and have seen something that the rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, it's a complete mess. Mum, mess - sin and a mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie got a payroll, but I would be ashamed to take it. I hope she has moved her agent / manager / publisher on this career. Of course she didn't make bad movies anymore. And more bad movies. Heart broken.
