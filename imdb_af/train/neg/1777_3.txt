If you're the kind of filmmaker who enjoys original content and intelligent tension, look elsewhere, kids, because Sleepwalkers really struggle. Usually I am more eloquent than that, but ... wow ... it was bad. I especially love it when Charles Tanya gives a ride home, she refuses, and then he is seen WALKING HOME. Where is his car ?? Anyway, don't see it, people. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jump on people. A man is stabbed by wheat. Cheesey arranges the proverbial "wazoo". Just don't see it. Wait, I'll take it back! See it for the writer Stephen King's cameo as the man who owns the cemetery. He is actually pretty good. Even with guest performances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But other than that ... wow ... BAD.
