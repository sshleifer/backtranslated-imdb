The subject that this latest adman-turned filmmaker is trying to tackle in his debut (ad) is quite an age-old subject of almost any cultural standard - timeless romance (pun). <br /> <br /> However, the exploration (and exploitation for Desi parents) is falling short, as the usual tendency to pepper, spice and sugar on the ordinary masala blend of b / g score , dance, drama and so on create a nice package. with not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene is repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetitions follow through the movie (after all the main characters are a cook). But there are lesson problems - no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh puts in a Cheeni Jyada (more) amount overworking. Really when will this man ever stop? How many 60 somethings are around so even when tampered with by a 30-something? Timeless thought yes, but surely the non-obscene bid? And tongue? Sorry, soul? Fairly good acting by Paresh Rawal, who has the only sensible role in the film. The director had no realistic feelings and got everything in hand. He got a new idea. Nowhere do we become with any real problems or issues that such a couple might face, other than being truly married, which is just the initial stumbling block. The subplot of a little kid with cancer (the first love of the baby's son) goes nowhere, and whatever a little poignancy that would call this otherwise unceasing presentation is quickly killed with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, try nicely but not quite there.
