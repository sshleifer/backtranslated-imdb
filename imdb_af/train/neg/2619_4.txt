It's a great movie for kids who love dogs. It runs a little slowly early, but ends up as a flurry of governor De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult movie is the talk bird who thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle or Monty Python) and blows like a dog. This is the comedy that the movie needs more. See it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
