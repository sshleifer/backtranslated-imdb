The movie is simply bad. Simply awful. The string of bad movies from Bollywood has no end! They have to excuse themselves for making such horrible films (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem looks particularly like the directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have shown in the past that they have the ability to perform well ... but they are so poorly targeted. The poor writing didn't help either. <br /> <br /> This movie has many ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan, Om Puri (from whom he ran away and spoke 30 years ago) and everything Om Puri finds to say is up to notice his friendship with Salman !!! What a little shit. Seriously. Not to mention the bath soundtrack. Whatever happens to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is the total miscarriage for portraying a rockstar. <br /> <br /> Only savings are the good performances in the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. So, Salman does as the drug addict. <br /> <br /> Just watch it for the last half hour.
