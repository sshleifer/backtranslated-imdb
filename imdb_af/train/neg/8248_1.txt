There were more interesting Polish documentaries on worm farming, in brail_ !! The competition (worm farming) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically ill after watching this movie. The cheat man (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer really needs, and what was with the accent !!. The venues and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank, and showed the humility of a 10-year-old in cooking class. It was so bad that I thought I would write the successor named "it's not a laxative". Thanks for listening, it was a big weight of my consciousness.
