Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding, who enters with aspiring hack writer Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disrupts his life claiming her "doppelganger" or evil twins kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This silly horror movie is hard to take seriously, even though filmmakers and actors are dead. A Doppelganger has an unpleasant dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that Drew's character's name is drawn from Audrey Hepburn's role in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and that Newbern's character's name is a play is the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (he actually tries to write "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I suppose it deserves some credit because it's not reasonable. Your typical horror movie - I mean, author / director Avi Nesher really looks to look at his characters, and gives his movie more plot than the standard treasure chest. <br /> <br /> After a bad villain-explaining-everything after the confrontation of the audience, the film continues to be a horrific, out-of-the-climax that must be seen to be believed. This movie certainly doesn't fall on the gore. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew killed her mother in this one. No, I'm not joking. Jaid Barrymore shows up close at the start of being violently slaughtered. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very alert and very sexy in this one. Newbern comes down as a nice enough, "nice" kind of man. But the highlight of the film must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former nun who started a telephone directory business. /> The movie is basically messy, but pretty amusing on a thin, bad little face. <br /> <br /> 4/10
