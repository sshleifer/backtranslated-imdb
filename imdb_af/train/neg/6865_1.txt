This movie was so bad, it was laughing. I couldn't resist looking at it. The plot is standard, the acting is pretty terrible (supporting role like the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend was better actors). Kind of amusing if you have time to waste and like to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The runner playing "Kathy" was just fascinating because I couldn't decide if her death team was falling flat because of a bad operation or just a bad act (I decided it was both ). It leaves the writing to comment, which was pretty awful. Pat remarks, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie. Perhaps that was so special; I do not know. I just looked to see how bad it could be. (In fact, the dialogue does not even qualify as 'cliche' - but it is almost completely silly.) <br /> <br /> All in all, very bad, cheaply made movie. The sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown over and over without any artwork or actual intervention to the action; more like props that randomly fell into action in a bad play. A chase scene could be shot by any young man in a warehouse or an old school: poor shot, cheap props, minimal action .... and I still wanted to see the end. Go figure.
