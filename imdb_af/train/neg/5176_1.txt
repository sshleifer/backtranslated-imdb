When a movie is independent and not graded, such as the Hamiltons, I expected from the norm, cutting out your heart violence. I know good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the site, and I even convinced some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to make this god horrible movie with me see. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Dawson's Creek with turbulent undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this movie, but there was little expectation that the movie was shot at hell when I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood from someone's finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much for the imagination. I'm not sorry to see Happy Feet. I think there was more violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons!
