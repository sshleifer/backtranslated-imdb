I didn't know anything about this movie until I was convinced to see it by a friend who heard it was a "non-stop epic battle scene from start to finish". It couldn't have been further from the truth. It was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateur-directed, horrible movies I ever had the accident of putting my eyes on. I will arrange it with the movie I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it's hard to believe that the creators of this movie thought that this cheesy soap opera shit would be taken seriously as the real historical fact. It also contains some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard ... like this gem ... Guy tells girlfriend "You smell like the moon." Meisie replied, "What does the moon smell like?" OMG! You gotta treasure me! The scene where the man was moved and quartered, received good listening from the audience, as it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound of FX's man torn apart reminded me of someone making a sound with their mouths. Playing at a theater near you avoids it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision in 45 minutes because I had to catch up with my sleep ... and I did it. Awful.
