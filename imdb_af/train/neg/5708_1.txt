People like me will tear this movie apart. It's just not realistic. The plot is so predictable. You can expect anything that happens, discouraging. Of course they find the treasure and get dirty rich, and deceive the bad man. We saw it a million times before. The authors of this movie must think that the majority of the movie audience is stupid. They must be right because the majority of people really like this movie. I mean solving puzzles in a matter of seconds. The secret treasure house hidden under the Manhattan subway? You would think with all the work that was underground in New York. The room would have been discovered before. and everything built during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail ?? How cute, and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler novels was poor. They just fall in love, in 2 seconds. When I want to be more concerned about saving my own ass, then I get a little. Hell with the girl and the stupid paper. 1/10 Waste
