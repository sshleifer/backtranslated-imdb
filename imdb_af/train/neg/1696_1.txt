I hate to throw out such lines, but in this case I feel like I should: The American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in theaters over the past 5 years. There I said it. And now that I got it from my system, please let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse collects in that place of those who meet it will be consumed by his anger." THE GRUDGE's starting point and I will admit it sounds interesting. Unfortunately, the filmmakers no longer take it. Those who experience the "curse" are indeed consumed by his anger and that is all you get. You are looking for more? Very bad. Some critics and fans point out that THE GRUDGE's only purpose is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to talk about, spectacular images and sounds can go just as far. Director Takashi Shimizu, who pulls a George Sluizer and re-emphasizes his own original movie (s), is trying to build atmosphere in the first hour? by repeating the same scene over and over and over. It looks like this: <br /> <br /> -There's going home <br /> <br /> - Something flashes through the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br / > person going exploring <br /> <br /> - sounding out loud <br /> <br /> -showing a ghost <br /> <br /> -shouting and / or screaming <br /> <br /> - look at black <br /> <br /> Before the audience even gives a hint of the plot, it is exactly the same scenario 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually slightly creepy. Every subsequent use became ridiculous when the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and I wondered whether this scene would "end with a loud scream and a cut to black." We have never been wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has no liner story, but deployed in a series of vignettes leaving the audience. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it's done right. The movie jumps from time to time, without rhythm or reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the HIGHLANDER 2 theater version. And this storytelling technique Mars any kind of secret that the movie might have had. Knowing all the ghosts has killed two characters, how shocking is when their bodies are found on the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the US version of the ring made the first $ 15m in the US version of RING, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The worst thing about THE GRUDGE is that it made $ 40 million its first weekend and some people regard it as the "scariest movie ever made." I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by the anger to pay to see the BIG?
