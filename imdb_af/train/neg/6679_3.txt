Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in 8-9 roles, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later disguised /> <br /> He is briefly a useless detective who sends a case to his friend to prove his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport while he is flourishing with Rani. <br /> <br /> He disguised as a Sardari in the plane and again as a girl. The funny part is so easy and short time he does. <br /> <br /> Then he disguises as a French singer and enters a TV to get trials. as a maharashtrian (yes within the TV itself) <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the same erroneous identities and ends on a predictable note. There are some funny scenes like Govinda that are based on an Afrikaner and many other things too <br /> <br /> Direction by Manoj Agrawal is good. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Among actors, Govinda proved again he is one of the most watchable actors. He is as usual of palatable even though he did such roles before taking all the action in the game, and too well here. Although the many-loaded 6-7 roles do not fit in the movie. Rani looks fat, teams well with Govinda it's her. She is nothing big and has such a role. Under the rest Nirmal Pandey is as usual. Johny Lever is too hard at times and funny in places in one roll and irritates as the older Tinnu Anand is okay. Satish Kaushik is hilarious. Paresh is okay. Tanaaz is okay.
