Okay, guys, we know why our movie looks like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A across the spot (with much more T than A). But ... shouldn't there be a story to go with it? <br /> <br /> "C'mon," I can hear you say - "It's just naked girls! Who needs a story?!" <br /> <br /> Well, if called the "NAKED Maniacs", I wouldn't have a problem. But as these men are screaming from "The Invisible Man", they need a little story about it, you know, to keep your mind busy. <br /> <br /> But all they can build is how it crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he cracks, uses it to speculate naked women and eventually kill many teenagers. And if you see the emerald teenagers, he goes, you will be grateful. <br /> <br /> One star, for the T and A, but there is a bit too much for you, so go ahead with caution. <br /> <br /> TIME - yes, it's Savannah.
