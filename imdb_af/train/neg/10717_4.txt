I give it a good four out of ten stars, or dots or markers, or something. <br /> <br /> There was a huge total of two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) went well enough. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual trade in stereotypes, burning speed, impetuously pushed by a silly soundtrack, and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two very funny scenes involved with Amy P. She's just really hilarious in an animal kind of way. She is a mix of that monkey they do on SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just gave up that they did it for the money, because if they did, the Sarah Palin parody gave birth and I think we Can say, yes, it was worth putting the black man back in the role of the servant, who is really there to help you be more people. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10 as I said was generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and a Half Men" is in this movie and she had some kind of plastic surgery so her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30-year-old, so every scene she's in is like me to try to rearrange her face, or put it in my mind or just answer the question: "No. Wait. Wait. Did she have plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer, you really don't want her to have plastic surgery.
