It must be a good movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson play together as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols directed. Uh uh. This is boring dull! Silent and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> This is a cookie cutter boy meets girl, boy wedding girl, boy has a relationship, girl leaves boy's story. Now there is an original concept! After two hours of tearing (was it just two? It felt like six.) I wasn't sure if it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure all of us did sixteen years ago that would rather forget us. I hope the damage to the reputation of Streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is fading. It's not that bad. It's just that it's such an incurable.
