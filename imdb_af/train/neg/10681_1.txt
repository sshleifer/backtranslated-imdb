How unfortunate, to have so much of my "a" list, and good "b" list actors agree to do this movie, but they did it. And it looked for me to look at it. I have never heard of this movie, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background, how bad can it be? In a word many! This movie starts has a few turns and turns, then lies an egg just. The end was so weak, it was as if the writer had been called and his 4-year-old son sat down with the author and hooked the end. How ironic a movie titled "The End Game" to have such an arm. These are the types of movies that a "list" factor can take to the "b" list. I hope Cuba Gooding does not make JR, and James Woods a habit of doing this.
