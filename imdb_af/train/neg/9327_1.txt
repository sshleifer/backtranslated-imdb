It has been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some VERY bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover seemed to be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? Filming the movie was scattered and boring. At one point there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving on a normal sunny day to a farm. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, incredible dialogue and basically no plot to talk about. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it can make a good comedy. Otherwise, if you see this movie, walk.
