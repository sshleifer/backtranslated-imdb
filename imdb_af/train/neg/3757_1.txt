How did it ever occur? I usually like Sci F / Bigfoot, regardless of movies etc. . but I still expect them to be written without so much cheese. The effects were sad, the lines were sad. Avoid at all costs. I just finalized because it was wrong (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson in it - haven't seen one yet). The idea of ​​the movie is actually a good one. There was a lot of potential to make a big movie here. I just don't understand how something like this ends like this. Talk to the film / art / English interested students in any high school and you will find people who can write a better writing.
