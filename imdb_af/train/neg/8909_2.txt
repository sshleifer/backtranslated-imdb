This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some scientists working on the edge of science make a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell?) And his daughter gets sucked or something, then one day for no apparent reason she returns and now has his big boobs and wearing a skimpy outfit (I think the demons in the other dimension made it to her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she is gay so natural, she is more interested in her new girl, and they stumble upon this witch game book (they want to be witches or something?) and the evil game ends to read again, how is the evil devil on earth, who is just the bikini top girl and the stray guy apparently can stop in love. There is no reason for topless scenes and a guy who says it in my boyfriend is a famous wrestler, but his part is completely unnecessary. Of course they made something to just put it in, because then wrestling fans can actually watch this senseless movie. . I'm sure the topless girls won't hurt it either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie. I thought it might help explain what was going on, but it just made it more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Actually, it's a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but there are a lot of things (like the other dimension and book seller) if it makes it confusing. I didn't like the movie, but it was just like five dollars. I don't recommend seeing it, but it's just too stupid, I can't think of any part of the movie that was good.
