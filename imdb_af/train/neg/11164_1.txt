What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie looked like it was trying to copy a cut comedy, but the direction and the writing were messy, sickly and sentimental in the worst movie tradition. Jack Black's acting / role was self-sufficient and self-centered ... and the other characters were equally deforming and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We are (WERE) fans of Black, but none of us did more than a forced tits for the duration. Why did he feel he should make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We won't see another of his films without first reading the reviews more carefully! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he ran the script before signing up for this drive?
