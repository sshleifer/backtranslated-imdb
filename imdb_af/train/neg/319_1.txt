A friend of mine bought this movie for Â£ 1, and even then it was very expensive. Despite great names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your head. It uses tired, bottom of the comic techniques - constantly breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience and seemingly useless settings of 'hot girls'. Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a ship who wants to make it a successful comedian to succeed with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shameless 'Dickie' because of his unwavering success with the opposite sex - is lost to the sea, Sandler's character, Shecker, is breaking his great. Dickie is not dead, rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe he just picked the worst movie of all time.
