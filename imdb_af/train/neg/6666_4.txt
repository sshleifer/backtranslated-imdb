I wanted this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I don't want to spoil this movie. Don't worry, from the beginning you know something bad is going to happen. But here's an example of how messy this movie is. The Cowboy and "Twig" ride on the reef. The Cowboy has a handle tube mustache. The Cowboy and "Twig" get a shootout and drive halfway down the reef. The Cowboy was cleanly shaved by the rest of the movie. Sometimes between the rifle battle and the mountain ride, the cowboy had time to shave on the horse in the dark. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the play of the four main characters is solid.
