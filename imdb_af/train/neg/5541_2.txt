Since then, the cinema lover has met a man named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with blood-created horror images and non-stop sequences. It is safe to say that she formed "Night of the Living Dead" the zombie film as we know it now. Yet, in the early years of the theater, the prospect of revised bodies was only used in slow, almost action-less psychological tension makers. Jacques Tourneur's "I walked with a zombie" is a perfect example and so is the "White Zombie" starring Bela Lugosi. This "Revolt of the Zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately it is a failure all over the line and easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Terrifying play, a very poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and excitement! The film lasts just 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is completely wasted on dumb love story-intrigue and unconscious monologues. The environment in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor surely resulted in a more compelling story, but all we ever see is indoor shots. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, handbook blonde with curly hair and ugly nose) made me very annoyed and I was hoping that a ravenous undead would suddenly come out of nowhere to devour her. Unfortunately again ??. If you are battling yourself through 60 sophisticated minutes, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent final. Yet it is too much to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you just need to see if you've already seen everything.
