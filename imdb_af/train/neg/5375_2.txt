After watching this movie, I feel almost 2 hours of my life, but I think there's something good in everything: <br /> <br /> If I judged it as any other movie, it could only receive 1 or 2 tops, but if I lower it than a low budget. movie, it can get 3 or 4. It is a movie that is supposed to be "complete" and without too many passages of boredom or waste of time. This movie is not. But I think a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and in view of this, this movie has some highlights. If I want to comment on what the directors should do with them in their next project, I think the distorted sound effects had some quality. They also manage to build characters, but it takes me what they have to leave in their next project, because the character building is too long, as it is mostly irrelevant to the movie. Also, the long periods of time devoted to walking around must continue in the next project - what is the point? I think this movie is trying to be a bit of everything (characters, tensions and a plot build), and ends nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is trying too much and too hard and I think it should have been cut for a short movie. I can easily walk around for an hour or a useless dialogue to cut off the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things going on in this movie. The story had to be more streamlined. I know there should be a little secret in this movie, but a little surprise to the killer is not a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" gets almost no attention during the film, which leaves the final "point" as a quick, unsatisfactory wrap-up. <br /> <br /> So I'd like to say this movie was a good try, but I can't. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in learning about low budget films, you don't need to see it - not even see why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> Like others said, I'm pretty sure the many 10's given to this movie are somehow involved in the movie. This movie could not receive a "10" from any remote view.
