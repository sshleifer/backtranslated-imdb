This movie makes you very concerned with the invention of the quick button on your remote control. It's beautiful boredom in beautiful photos. For once, Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. But what I found difficult to take was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot, the girls were portrayed so much younger than they actually were. This whole Lolita thing, especially since there is an older man involved, makes me rather uncomfortable. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a great time - between adult consent. Another thing I found strange was that Beart and Schüte didn't have a proper one either.
