What a terrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of cliches I've seen for a long time. Not that I saw much. I shouted the theater after about 40 minutes looking for a tight drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was terrible as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - completely wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Police are trying to be politically correct. This film still maintains racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced music teacher teacher teaches disadvantaged children violin in poor neighborhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just written to customize the terrible writing. Aaargh! Wes Craven actually curled me once. true horror this one!
