In the first place, Jon Bon Jovi doesn't seem to be in a vampire movie. Along with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline, the whole movie is predictable. Keeping this in mind and you're a total vampire movie, you can have some fun with the screens. Don't expect these Tarantino chapters here or an Anne Rice storyline. (I expect I have forgotten the whole movie tomorrow;)
