If you want to know the true story of the Wendigo, I suggest you get a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad, but it has nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it as a child (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and was so excited to see a movie based on it coming out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) undertones throughout the film that were not in the movie. When the book was written, PC didn't even exist. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is not wasting your time or money !! If you see it on the video store shelf, LOSE IT.
