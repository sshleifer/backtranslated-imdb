Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - what are the usual successful white middle-class belly types found in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something in Woody Allen comedies, but here he really falls flat on his face. Even the one-liners left him. It's really no plot, but Allen seems to be the place to use a semi-mystical air, which just makes the thing even more flawless and half-baked. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work at all and is just a huge drill. The best thing about this movie (apart from the end credits coming) is that the bad reviews wake him up and realize that it just brings a slapdash script and throws your friends in there, not for entertainment.
