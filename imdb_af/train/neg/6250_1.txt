I actually did like this show, once at a time. That's until I realized all the mistakes. It's so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not even the least credible. Here's why. ** Spoilers in front of people ... ** Are we really supposed to believe that a child like Yugi would descend from a pharaoh of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He is the biggest nerd on Earth's face. And what about the pharaoh (ie Atem and / or Yami's) hair? Last looked at, Pharaohs were shaved (except for a little hair on top of the head) and wore decent hats. <br /> <br /> And we must be convinced that an evil rich genius named Seto Kaiba can legally run a successful business while still having the time to go to a small school like "Domino High"? Puh-leeze! First, he must legally be an adult to manage a company. And it won't really make him too much of a genius genius, as he will be the only adult in his class. And the second time, why would he attend a school like 'Domino High' when his business is clearly successful enough to attend a fine-looking academy? In addition, the margins with his little brother are so juicy and lame. Every time you turn around, the kid is kidnapped by goons for the bath. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor kid who lives with a father for nothing else. It says that Joey earns all the money to attend his school because his father is an alcoholic, but you never even see Joey doing anything like work. He doesn't even mention work. And his sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why would she choose a snob like Duke (who dressed her brother in a dog costume and humiliated him on television) about a nice man like Tristan? Is she really so clueless? Several characters throughout the show are occupied by demonic powers, get their souls stolen by demonic forces and become spiritually prey. (Oh, it's kids safe, NOT.) Tea is the typical girl next-by-type, the only purpose of which is to be Yugi / Yami's friend. And while she has some cool points, she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply awful. All the characters look sickly and anorexic. The perspectives are terrible (especially when doing close-ups of someone's hand) and the colors look good but not star. <br /> <br /> But the worst plot hole for the series was the fact that Yami says his Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies. If so, how did he not save Yugi's grandfather in the first place, when Pegasus stole his soul and bothered to get it back? <br /> <br /> All it really is is a commercial for itself. The only plus is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Shortened Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Worth doing something more. Like, look at the abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
