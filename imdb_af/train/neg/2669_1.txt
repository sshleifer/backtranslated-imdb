I'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a movie. But I can't understand how this one made. Who made it? How could they have thought they were able to make a movie? Did they do a weekend course at a film school, get a pretty big check from daddy and disrupt David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or was he having a chance to have a long-time family friend / distant affair who did it out of mere wrong kindness? I don't care, don't want to know. Even he seemed completely embarrassed to be in it, muttering his lines and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP had to be the neighbor of the neighbors. There was absolutely no sound design, the script, the direction and the editing were all uncomfortable and honestly, the apathy that now overwhelms me means I can't bother Spending more of my life on this movie.
