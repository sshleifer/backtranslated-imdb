I'd like to write about the story, but there wasn't any. I would like to have some hard-hitting dialogues from the movie, but "fishing" is just funny for 5 minutes, and then it's left over. I'd love to swoon about the 'keep-your-guessing tension', but it was as predictable as ... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would like to speak from the side of the seat, but I don't like cartoons much. <br /> <br /> * Sigh * <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people who commit suicide - I promise it will push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists - This movie is far more effective than the barbed wire Silas's husband wore in the Da-Vinci code. 3. People who explore alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seems to be in a mood to kill someone. 4. Movie Pirates: More power for them. If any movies deserve not to spend the audience spending money, this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things need an IQ factor that is slightly larger than the film's. Consideration: The director of the movie is, of course, a species of its own. (And I hope God is the only one of his kind. One is enough). Things that made it a better movie: 1. A Story 2. A Choreographer 3. A Author Writer 4. A Stunt Coordinator 5. A Story (Have I Said It?) 6. A Director - Preferable one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could do a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - "See Yash Raj movies are harmful to your mental health? Things I like about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 The English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" - "My heart is in a void", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" turns into " Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond ". /> <br /> In short, Tashan is the opposite of a Rubrics cube. The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player. Tashan promises to lower your IQ and that. are just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * Suck * .. But it's just me. I can be wrong. You have been warned in any case.
