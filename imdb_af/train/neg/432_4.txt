This movie has the potential to be much more than it was. But it does not just fail to deliver, it brings equal self-righteous preaching at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he must have a southern accent, which he loses every scene a few times. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his rag, but apparently runs through this movie and collects a salary. He is good as usual but hardly stands out. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast - throwing female romantic interest, adding little or nothing to the story. Talk about the story, a weakened "who really cares" story where Cusack is the righteous mayor's son who just has to find the right thing. <br /> <br /> People don't act like this. Cusack's character eventually loses all credibility, which, without being revealed, is sermon and nausea. The final scene makes the penultimate folly look. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not enter the law. <br /> <br /> It's bad, by the number movie. It looks interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a beautiful, proselytizing, self-righteous movie for the last hour. Better off with unashamed shit than this stack of rubble.
