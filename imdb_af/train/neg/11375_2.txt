Are you talking to me? (1987) is a nice movie with a few guys I've never seen, or since being a guy from the neighborhood, trying to become an actor. He has heavy jones for taxi driver than trying to use that shtick to raise it. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone does, change his image! He goes from good fella to a burning man over night. His friend can't believe the change (but he plays with Faith Ford and gets a cool payday). Can this young punk keep his street credit while making it big? <br /> <br /> It's a real lame movie trying too hard to record too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor performance. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up and run the ball because the filmmakers frustrated the ball this time around. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Forest Gump Bubba. <br /> <br /> xx
