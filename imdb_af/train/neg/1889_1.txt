This film is in no way entertained, but more of a look deep in the depths of the darkest side of human behavior. Leave half a dozen stories of the worst kind of disruptions, distort sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action is played over a couple of very hot and tough days during a heat wave in Vienna and the heat may be responsible for some of the rage and hate in the movie. For me, dealing with the delayed girl through the security equipment salesman over the worst episode, now followed by the screens of drunkenness and perversion in the 'bad' apartment. You will be grabbed and I hope this movie is outraged. I hated it, but I forced to see it through. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 for showing 'man' as he is sometimes.
