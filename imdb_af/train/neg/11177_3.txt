In what looks like the longest 1st 35 I've had to endure long ago, Al Pacino delivers an accurate performance to be sure. Not his usual typing, which was nice. But his character was just very pathetic. Someone to frighten while stumbling to forget appointments, as we realize that Hollywood social life has drained him from his life energy. But in this movie we needed someone to love. And for some reason every character in the picture said, "I don't know why I love you, Eli," to Al Pacino's crook and I couldn't even hold him close. <br /> <br /> All the Other actors played their usual styles. Tee Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established people who were developed on television or earlier films. And Kim Basinger wasn't even in the movie long enough to deliver a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The film's story had no momentum. Most scenes never move the story forward, but rather gather facts about characters that later came into an anti-climatic end. It has potential, except for their reluctance to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz will believe "Once Hollywood has you, you can't come out." Yes right! And so many people are being fired in Hollywood.
