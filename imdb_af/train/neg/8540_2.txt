As someone else mentioned, it started with a bizarre prologue about a blonde girl killing a cat. Then the main story meets: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) happen to travel to the mountains. Firstly, they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord at Gaffari gets into the audience with increasing irritation. Once in the mountains they look for shelter again and are invited by a friendly old lady who is hospitable to strangers. (Hansel and Gretel, someone?) What happens now, I'll leave for the fat viewer to sort out, because I couldn't guarantee it. Now, I love Euro Horror, and it would have been better if only Artigot (author AND director) made an effort to tell logical stories. The Background (Pyrenees?) Make an excellent and intriguing place for mysterious and occult events. The green peaks can easily hide supernatural powers and those who command them. That photography is nice. Just want to make the whole thing sense. You can view this movie at archive.org.
