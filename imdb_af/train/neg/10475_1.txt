I am a young pastor's wife and we have taken a few youths to watch this movie. We then spent an hour explaining it to them. They didn't find it and I didn't enjoy it. It is based on a concept that has been run by all three major religions of the world (the Bible code, the Torah code and the Code of the Quran) and so doubtful that it is ridiculous. It's not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it's a step forward for those who believe we are looking at our brain at the door.
