With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space", how can you go wrong? Just throw some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the Village People as the main providers for the soundtrack and throw in tons of gay gags. Plot is unimportant. Too bad, this movie doesn't contain any of these and every joke misses the place. The characters all look like the German gay nigger, one or two jokes, the rest fail. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh more about the movie. My expectation was apparently high.
