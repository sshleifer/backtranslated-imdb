If you have read the original novel, as you have done, you will probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The movie version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a 1980s nightmare conglomerate anachronisms that attempt to create a "period piece" set in the late 1950s and fail to censor or even pay homage to that period - the American monster of _DirtyDancing_ is similar to 1963, except that the film was financially successful despite having equally amateur writing magazines. Except for the "look up to 1980s", the characters have been changed, rearranged and played to the point that the only features they have in common with that of the novel are the slightest superficial appearance and of course their names: Suze is transformed from the narrator 's ex-girlfriend's flight and promiscuous negrophile who are willing to marry in a frightened and naive "Eve" archetype tempted by fame with a closed old queen for money (on their own in the first few pages) and shine, exploited and somehow in a scandalous marriage struck by her boss, which was not surprisingly given a Van Dyke and pointed hairstyle. She and the narrator, named "Colin" (after the book's author, Colin MacInnes) for the film, are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Big Jill's character, a lesbian seeming butch but "jerky" in the midst of the 20s acting as a feast of young and bubbly lesbians, and one of the closest friends of the trust distributing honest wisdom to the narrator, with only a few throw-away lines and tons of comic outfits. <br /> <br /> The Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another good storyteller in the novel, is also being brought to the point of being meaningless in the movie. , camp and ignored everything. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a kind of sad minor character, but in the film he is played to come out as optimistic and strangely enthusiastic despite the awkward environment, and the disorder of his marriage with the narrator's mother's body ignored for all practical purposes. <br /> <br /> In his favor, the music (for what it is) is well-crafted, and you have to give the production and writing staff credit to actually take a rule out of the book ("... some days, they will write musical about the 1950s ... ") as their inspiration to write a musical, but in the world of bad camps musical, it is one of the worst in the forest. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_, important plot elements are treated as reflections. Unlike the Apple, there is a shaky and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue. <br /> <br /> You can't really do it, it's in the 1980s, because it was created in the 1980s. The film version of _Annie_ released in 1981, pays a wonderful, well-executed tribute to the appearance and feel of New York City in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages a sharp look of the 1980s, despite being on a low budget in 2003 (although not explicitly set in the 1980s, those living through the decade cannot deny that the movie "feels very 1980s"). It was clear that it might be positive to make something good from this issue, especially in the light of the iconic status that the source list has in the United Kingdom, but it does not usually look like the look and feel, and also in the Treating the source material Maybe if you're not reading and not going to read the novel, you can enjoy this 1980's anachronism that gives a shameful parody of Soho London's modernist jazz set. I can definitely see what the writing team was trying to do, but they certainly could have done better. With Boy George as a household name and mixed race musicians and bands on the cards in 1986 in the UK, they certainly didn't need the characters to make the characters in the ways they ended up. In fact, I go so far as to say that the authors have liquidated what critically criticized both the book and the film - it eventually had a lot of adults who set apart the shit and heard his targeted teenage as treated twice. idiots to make a quick buck.
