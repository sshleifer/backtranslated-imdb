Every new autumn series shows deserves at least my "3 strikes and you are out" policy. I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, these are 3 complete episodes. After Episode 1, I actually told the TV, "Tomorrow canceled". It was so bad. I have now watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and even managed a smirk. Not a titter, a guffaw, a chortle, as a matter of fact, no face movement. I will still punish myself by watching every future episode, because I am convinced that I miss something clear in this show. I'm simply not 'getting', but I believe a comedy on a big TV network should be the first to be funny; but there is no laughing at me. There is no way ABC will be at least the funniest comedy at 8:00. I KNOW there must be an inside joke that just doesn't walk around with my brain. I've read all the previous comments, I "get" the social aspect of it, but, WHERE IS THE JOKES ???? I will continue to suffer at least 30 minutes a week until I have a light bulb moment and scream in the head "Eureka".
