Here's one that you can see with a straight face, with a writing so bad, Will Ferrell won't be in it either. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. The Punch Dance. Rod has to go into his quiet place. And before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he's a passionate, over-moving body yard to the strains of a band that has Europe's major faux metal hooks. <Br /> <br /> 2. John Farnham says you're the voice. In one of the epic rows where the star and its cohorts run the Slomo, the main road runs down and the townspeople follow their heels, the sound track is the clock. How did the filmmakers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A great Australian singer (and a true talent) who held the Raindrops in the early 70s, is falling on my head, disappearing until 1986 for The Big Comeback. You're the voice. John Farnham's national anthem is so surprisingly cheesy, it aimed mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Besides these two high points in the movie - both ruined it with the disc disc - the rest of the movie is like a dimple on someone else's vomit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jersey that has never made a leap. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that he drives a moped in the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yes, somebody actually thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> Without a jump under his star belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which will surely kill a less bad comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather while eradicating cancer and whatever ... who is watching these movies anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leaders in these comedies), he hits a salibrious chick (Isla Fisher), which must surely be delayed to consider replacing chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost phoned in her show - changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must lose a bet to be here.
