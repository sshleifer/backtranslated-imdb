Okay, honestly, I don't see why everyone thinks it's so good. It's really not. There were two good things coming from this movie. 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can put out my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No one other than that it has become quite stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick who designed Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked every time she became scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have had more respect for that if Kubrick ended it otherwise. And the whole movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 10/03.
