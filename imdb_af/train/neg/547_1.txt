The movie's full title is "Waqt: Race Against Time". It's a race that no one can ever win, but you can definitely cut your loss margin by not wasting any of your precious "waqt" on this bakery. This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. This has spurred my credibility too far. It was ridiculously stupid in his storyline, and deserved to mock it. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as terrible as Baghban or Black, but this movie didn't recommend anything. Dumb, senseless, with a ridiculous OTT performance by Amitji. The central "plot" is another nasty example of the cruel manipulative propaganda that infects so many "family" BW films. If my father, who raised me and whom I loved, treated me like Big B Akshay, I would shoot him myself. To say nothing about the trivialization of terminal disease.
