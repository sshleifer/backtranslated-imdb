"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a good idea can be devastated by pathetic topics such as pseudo-patriotism. Here travelers are trying to destroy Japan's future, and replace the local hero Godzilla with their dog monster, the three-headed golden dragon King Ghidorah. However, they fail and eventually Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between the two are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and the whole thing about "Japan is good" is really stupid. The creators of this movie have not even threatened the enemies of Japan, and make them stupid, blond guys, who are easily cured by the clever Japanese. The good thing is that Godzilla and King Ghidorah have almost destroyed both Japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular battle. But to this royal battle, the film was really boring and pathetic.
