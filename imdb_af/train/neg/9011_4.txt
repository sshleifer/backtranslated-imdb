Nice standard B-movie. Seriously, anyone who looks at "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a lot of people making their first movie should know better than expecting real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to rework popular formulas. If you even give them a drawing analysis, you will destroy the movie for yourself (and perhaps write a self-critical, blatant review on IMDb.) I liked the female head, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought she was particularly attractive. It was an unforgettable B-movie look. Unfortunately, I don't see where she's been making movies ever since. I'll look at her again.
