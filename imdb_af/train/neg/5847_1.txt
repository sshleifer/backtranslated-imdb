I enjoy quality crapness, and it stands up there with some of the best. The CG is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the madness of a 6-foot block in a rock dress that drives behind people is laughable. I enjoyed it very much, but the play is so terribly terrible, and even the mandatory naaktones don't really have a clash in it. just a total waste of time when I ever saw one. I don't know who wasted more time, I watched it, or the poor juice that dragged it into the hard hope that it would start their acting careers. I can assure you, it won't. But on a better note, I managed to make the 6-degree Kevin Bacon successful from this movie, so I think it was almost worth watching the 91 minutes of it.
