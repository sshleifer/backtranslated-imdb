It was a boost for me from the local video store. Don't make the same mistake I did. This movie is boring, unconvincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle was particularly poorly written and delivered; I clipped at every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes some thin appearances and is his usual apostate self; His role was clearly not a stretch for him. And while the movie is believed to be in Puerto Rico, it feels much more like a Hollywood movie; All the main characters are white and some tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Strange. Anyway, if you see this one on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
