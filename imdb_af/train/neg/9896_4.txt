The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the Parisian of Caesar is the time. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. That's why it's hard for me to revisit this movie in depth because I didn't understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the part is very difficult and I found it to be a newcomer, Leonor Varela is playing well. She is strong-willed, but also a very supportive, gentle soul mate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main issue of the first episode. So, it's not really a documentary, or a peplum, but a great love story. After the parody comes a new lover (Marc-Antoine) but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So, I found the second episode dull and their tragic fate is not being told powerfully. <br /> <br /> However, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; The Moroccan residence is exotic and the wardrobes are wonderful. The producers definitely have a lot of money, but they don't spend anything on the special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, sphinx) that it's funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to hear it very much in French or English to make a definite opinion on these two movies.
