This movie will enhance the mindset. Read a book! It's amazing someone who thinks this movie deserves the time and investment to make. I've seen B movies before, but the "C" movie has just been invented. I didn't think I'd ever enjoy Power Rangers as my kids stopped watching, but I found myself watching the videos for fifteen minutes in "Knights". High school productions are better than this and the actors involved have to erase it from their CV. Embarrassment is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who likes these movies, even switched it off. Now it really tells you. If you watch this movie and want it, I'll pray for you.
