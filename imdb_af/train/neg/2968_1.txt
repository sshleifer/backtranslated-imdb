If it is not possible to disregard the boring marijuana smoke (it appears to be required by government-funded films from Australia), the movie of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance. It's as far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot is overloaded with 'wow' symbols intended to look good on film, but doesn't go anywhere. A gross example is the giant peach float, which is naturally left of a village parade and donated by the local canning factory. This was just too tempting to waste which was hopefully a free but irrelevant prop! The peach is flown at one stage, unexplained washing, but that is where it ends. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the proven "black spot" road sign where Steph's parents were murdered is the symbol of the ultimate escape from her past, but escaping to what? She had a very good relationship where she was, especially in view of her visual disability and the eternal, loving patience and care of her young female guardian. <br /> <br /> However, the Guinness wheat melodrama prize goes to Alan's characterization. Alan strives successfully for the noble role of trade-unionists, but "rats" on his co-workers by becoming an evil multi-national lift supervisor! spot! As supervisor, Alan performs the boss's villainous dirty work. He implements dismissal to surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic, unemployed failure. No clich√©-free zones here, mate! Not only that, but Alan also loses the seductive Steph of the most unlikely relationship you will experience. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic, don't ask for detail. What is the meaning of the razor on Steph's seductive leg? Why make the hotel where the couple love makes sure that someone gets illegal access to one of his most beautiful bedrooms, and among others pandemoniums the sheets are regularly dirty - it's spectacular at one occasion. Summarize this movie in one word: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.
