The movie has only one error, unfortunately this error damages all the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> It begins with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of disputed areas. It fails to address the reason Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel occupies their country because those countries have lost it in a war they have begun. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel has plagued the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. Problem is 242 <br /> <br /> Many movies are well-crafted and can really showcase images that change thoughts, but remember, if you look at something, believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All participants in this film are known as critics of Israel, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments, removing the possible credibility of their words. . <br /> <br /> Not all Palestinian sympathizers need any participant's need for a real-life lesson that is objectively learned.
