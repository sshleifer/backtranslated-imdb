I have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez, who made the game popular and successful Blair Witch Project clear. In addition, it is an alien movie of all sorts, and sounds like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies the critics hated, but I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I felt that for most parts, Change is a waste of time, so I'll keep this review short. Premises are always promising, and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual others would imagine you as a nutshell. Stories about alien abduction should always be handled with probes in the openings, so I'm not going into details, but you get the drive that is uncomfortable and something you want to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you get a chance for revenge? That is, you succeed in successfully hunting and catching one in life. What are you going to do? For this group it's a happy repayment period, or so they thought. And this is where the film begins to develop into a snooze, with a bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it's budgeted low, there aren't many redeeming factors, it's the strength of the storyline, or any help from the cast to make their characters just a little interesting. This is the standard cardboard display of an ordinary vanilla font, along with some cheap scare tactics. <br /> <br /> What is good is the make-up. There has been a lot of trouble making some of the things I will not mention, because it will only spoil the few elements that make this movie tolerant. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and greedy moments. It is nothing you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Just look here as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in town - Fees, this one is less fun and takes it too seriously. Falling through an uninspired direction, you were warned.
