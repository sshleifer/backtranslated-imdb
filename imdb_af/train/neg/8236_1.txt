I can't believe it's on DVD. Even less was my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue it's a good movie if you consider it has only a $ 4000 budget. I find it funny. I will find it very bad, regardless of the budget. <br /> <br /> More funny, I read the following in another review: "Dramatics aside, if you love horror and you love something like Duel (1971) Updated with a little more story and Throw in some pretty girls, you'll love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? It is a pity that the two movies are compared. <br /> <br /> I give a "1" since I can't give a "0". I just see no way to entertain this movie.
