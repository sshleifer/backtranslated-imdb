This engaging (which should not be) low grade Spanish exploitation (pretty tame, I can add) looks good, but how? Let me express it again, huh? Actually, the word is "huh?" would go through your mind a lot. Nothing makes sense, and it doesn't try either. Not only do I know whether it is complicated cryptic or just a complicated confusion, but there is no denial of how lax, inexorably, weirdly it feels. <br /> <br /> Ties unrelated (like that nasty opening that includes a little girl, dead cat and fire) in a sparse story with photographer Mario (played by a John Caffari chest, whose mustache is a dead ring for Nintendo's iconic Mario, what is the chance?) his girlfriend at home and a young girl meets lady (Patty Shepard) who asks him to come with him on a photography assignment, where they come to this remote mountain access, they come across a few witches. <br /> <br /> Look past the unpaved plot structure and turn in. What is simply a moody atmospheric mechanism and growing discomfort. Raul Artigot gives some spectacular exceptional visual and unpleasant passages, but looks mostly sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's eye-catching cinematography lenses the graceful rich scenery as we take the scenic view and let the time calm down. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwhelming score blends immensely with a compelling dense atmosphere created. The lead is capable, but there is also a solid bunch (the choice of VÃ­ctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slowly but little interest but manage this dreamlike setup to keep you close to closing it.
