I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of "romance" and "western" with some Grand Canyon area being thrown in. But if you expect a typical healthy romantic western, forget about it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a young girl who doesn't even have puberty and a middle-aged man! The child is also coveted by other men. It's sick. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as compassionate by resisting his attraction on Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one pursuing the relationship. He first tried to repel her, but eventually he gave in and drove them off as a happy, loving couple. It is rebellious. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this movie can attract anyone other than pedophiles.
