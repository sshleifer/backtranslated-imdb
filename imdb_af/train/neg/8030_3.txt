Not too keen on this. The story is pretty horrible and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. Then it was pretty terrible. Tim doesn't fit the role, he comes across as a self-assured ass and Pruitt Taylor Vince is totally unconvincing as a trumpet player. It's an idealistic movie and, as a musician, feels slightly offensive after it's been watched. There are no scenes of 1900 practice or playing with his fellow teammates, he is completely happy. I find it difficult to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe I'm looking at the wrong movie. If you do not have a true passion for life or feel of what music is all about then happy in the suspension of unbelief and look at this waffle.
