This film is completely rubbish. Some intellectual intellectuals comfort themselves by making every effort to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class. Nothing more than a piece of self-sufficient catharsis. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this kind of movie is in the US, it will definitely be a joke. And just because it comes from the other side, makes it a masterpiece, a wonderful entertainment for some brainwashers and / or brainwashing esters (some maybe George W. :). A typical cold war chase, anyway a kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I will say, as it is expressed in this movie, all that Soviet intellectuals have been thinking for years, maybe they deserve all the misery they claim to have gone through. BUT NO! Because like many others, I have read and watched real masterpieces made by truly outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something that is also relevant to the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's movie - is a true masterpiece. Real life, true tragedy, true sadness, true pride and dignity, one of the most real of the Soviet era.
