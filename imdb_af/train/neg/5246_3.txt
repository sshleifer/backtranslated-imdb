Wow, the haunting thing about this episode was the price of homes 40 years ago. I will preface saying I'm not a fan of narrated episodes. As the story / actors / etc. The salt is worth it, they must be able to convey most of the narrative without reading it out, reminding me of characters who can't think of the cuff, but relying on teleprompters. The psychobabble was boring and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's not just my cup of tea. They could have kept the story, but at least made it much more credible and interesting than that of a psychiatrist or perhaps a newspaper reporter or something. Niggling little things like Peugeot at home, a single half-circle driveway, but he apparently carved his car in the tree where he is standing because it is nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. Untidy editing, as she walks into the driveway (for what the 100th time looks like) exactly, who are the two guys you see at 24h30s, walk to the car as she pulls into the driveway of the abandoned house? The dolly-close-ups were also redundant, like a Jr. High playwright who discovered the zoom feature on his camera for the first time. I can keep apart, but it can be as boring as this episode. It continued to dress and the real goal was to use absolutely all the stock they shot from Elaine to manage the Newport convertible. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle game, while a voice about us all told about the 8-player, automatic top, etc. The only good thing I should say about his one is that it just ends suddenly. No loose points attached, nothing explained or terminated. Not that many would notice, I suspect most have already changed the channel or killed at the end.
