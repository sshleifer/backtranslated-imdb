Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of the BodySuckers" as it is known here in the UK, was a bit boring horror movie about an old man being bitten by a mysterious toxic plant in a greenhouse !! The man rushed to the hospital, where this worm comes from his mouth, which naturally changes into this insect sample and continues to go on the rampage !! Despite Steve Railsback and John Vernon in the movie, I found it boring, with a flat predictable story, interesting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action !!!! Horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie, you won't miss much, trust me !!! I give this movie 2/10.
