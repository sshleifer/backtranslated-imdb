Words failed me. <br /> <br /> And that's not common. <br /> <br /> Well done, it could have been a wonderful, funny spoof B movie slide, but unfortunately it wasn't to be. Rarely in the field of drama, so many skilled actors struggled in vain with such a dog breakfast from a screenplay. I can only endorse the previous reviewer's comments - clean the bathroom. Actually do nothing except this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negative: Everything else. <br /> <br /> Most dedicated line: "It's not everywhere." <br /> <br /> If only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate.
