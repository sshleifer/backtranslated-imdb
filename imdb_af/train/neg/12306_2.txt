This movie is a pure failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but even he can't save the tired idea and Swiss cheese. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I DO NOT feel the other user's comments reflect the poor rating this movie received (and justify!). It is extremely misleading. I often tagged this movie up to $ 3.00 in the grocery store and now I definitely know why. <br /> <br /> If I could just get my 90 minutes back ...
