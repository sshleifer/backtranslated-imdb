<br /> <br /> I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and unfortunately I can tell you that the movie has hardly lived for them. <br /> <br /> As much as I loved seeing Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the authors had to realize early in the script that seven people falling into the water were not original or funny. is not. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the one that is not, is just boring. I smiled three times during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Placing Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign; "Findus made it happen!" <br /> <br /> The GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 doesn't have to be seen at the movie or on DVD, but just wait for it to go on the television, it won't take too long.
