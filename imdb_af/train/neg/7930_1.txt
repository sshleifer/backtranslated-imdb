This piece of shit was known 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films ever made with the Indian Indians played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart was a giant racist in real life, just like his good friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart fired actor Hal Williams from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series of merry-go-ins) just because Williams was black. As if it wasn't bad enough, this movie is very dated and boring. Stewart was in his forties when this terrible film was made, and even with his ridiculous wig, he still looks like a pedophile chasing after 16 years. -The Debra Paget. I'm surprised it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
