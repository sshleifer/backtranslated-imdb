I was about 7 when this DIRECT MONSTROSITY was released from a movie. In the United Kingdom, it was advertised on the TV during the summer of 1977, as if it were an incredible block film. It was actually the first movie I've ever seen at a theater, and I've been postponed for years to come. The following week I was invited to watch the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. Until today I have never seen it before, in protest against Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could tell I was looking at garbage. It's just as bad, it's almost incredible. Rotting nonsense that never had to make it into a theater. However, I was amused to read all these years that the director never addressed much more directly. Avoid ALL COSTS !!!
