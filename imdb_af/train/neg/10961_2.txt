Although the movie was probably Lewis's book (because the script was basically word-for-word, verbatim), it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this no. The mythical creatures (unicorns, sentaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are * drawn *, and as in the previous review, the green-screen flying sequence was very difficult to swallow. I almost laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant, sturdy fit and teeth; I almost cried when I heard the wolf's "cry". A man in a gray fuzzy suit shouts as loudly and as fiercely as he can. <br /> <br /> All the acting is hugely forced, especially that of little Lucy Penalty ... I could watch as much indignation, despair, and teeth in the (which feels like) fourteen hours the movie. The actress who plays the White Witch, in all her histrionics, seems to be more on stage on stage, where a booming voice, arms spread and a brave effort at something Shakespeare would be more than welcome. <br /> <br /> The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the screens are inside or outside. Inside, it is as if the BBC could only afford to spend $ 100 to set up a set, and so it is very small, and all the characters are constantly merged. The White Witch's Castle is a descending, rotting rural English castle full of Styrofoam statues and bad lighting. When the Penalty Children wander through the forest - actually, * any * scene in the bush - they feel like they're just wandering in circles. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks good in the movie is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC has probably blown the entire budget of the movie to build the mechanical cats. It looks good when it stands still and before it starts talking, but once it starts moving, you can't be sorry about the poor man who has to be in the back of the lion's pack. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you are a stubborn Narnia fan, you might want to see this version just because it's every word Lewis ever wrote - but Lewis was definitely not a scriptwriter, and much of The Dialogue feels chunky and uncomfortable when on the screen. At the scene where the children are at Beavers and ready to flee the wolves, Mrs. Beaver's incessant, "oh, just one more thing, deariss, and then we'll be ready to go" cry and sigh simultaneously and moans of "NO, Mrs Beaver, PLEASE!" - A play of comic relief, so uncomfortable (they are supposed to come from an imminent danger, not wondering if the sewing machine is going or not), detract from the drama that the scene might otherwise have. In fact, the whole movie is peppered with the direction of faux pas like this. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new film, featuring updated effects, spectacular computer animation, timing and a wonderful and play-fitting White Witch (which shares her with all the subtle delusions of a seasoned politician, as opposed to a screaming banshee) of magnificence and the wonder of the world of Narnia without distracting the least of Lewis's original vision (I think). Lucy is a lot of heretics (NO bucks, YAY!), Like beavers (and realistic-size), and Bratty BBC Edmund has nothing to do with the divine, desperate-hunger-for-acceptance-uncertain and anxious-and-inferiority - complex Edmund that the new Disney version is ahead. <br /> <br /> Unless you are the type of wasting time to have fun with campy movies, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
