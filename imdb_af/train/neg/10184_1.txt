For months I heard about this little movie and now I saw it. I find it cute, cute, how many directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas to make their own one-joke premise on a movie. Troops, Swingblades, any of the million Blair Witch parodies occur. If everything that these directors want is a foot in Hollywood's door, they do the right thing and they have to stop it because the combination of plot sketches is how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard the phrase, "This is Animal House meets Back to the Future"; "It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films were original and daring, not safe and predictable.
