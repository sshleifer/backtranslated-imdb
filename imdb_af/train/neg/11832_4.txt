From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. OK, it grabbed my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Spoel Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means Spoel is gone is not good. The animation and all the special effects were extremely good, but the movie wasn't. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was just for kids. It's not serious for adults to actually love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes for adults meant. I bet children don't understand the jokes. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, I thought like this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm totally disappointed. 10/04
