For those who have never heard of it (or seen it on A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight, chain smoke, foulmouthed psychologist, called Fitz, who helps the Manchester Police Department into the heads of violent criminals. It is considered one of the best shows ever to come from England (and it says something) and was successful in 1993 in England and around the world. <br /> <br /> Now, the original stars are back with the original author to eliminate another 2-hour episode. I've loved this show since I've seen it for over a decade ago. The DVD box sets a place of honor in my collection, and I can quote a whole bunch of Fitz's query settings virtually word for word. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltrane retreat with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute pleasure. <br /> <br /> I start with the good. One of the many things that impressed me from the original Cracker series was how fast Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes in the first episode ?? With his reading (throwing the books in the air), she drinks and his cussing from the man to him on the gambling machine test? and you knew, know who this character was. You can feel "click" in your mind, the kind of click that just happens when a good actor gets a big role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Of course, Coltrane stayed big during the show, but I always felt some of the later episodes ?? Those not written by McGovern? The character was abused. <br /> <br /> The good news is: Fitz is back. Once you see him in this show? Make incredible inappropriate comments at his daughter's wedding? you will feel that it "clicks" again. It's him: for a moment and a little bit, sorry the following, always insightful, sincere to the point of tactlessness, but brilliantly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as I do, you'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie. And it goes to Judith and Markus: virtually everything that has to do with the Fitzs is handled perfectly. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this movie revolves around the crime that Fitz is trying to solve. In standard Cracker mode, do we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes ?? The tension lies in the fact that Fitz portrays it. In this case, we have a series of killers for American blood. And the reason for this is unfortunately not due to any credible psychological trauma? Rather, it seems as if the murders here are merely to give the author his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this because I believe Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers. in the world. I also have no problem with movies about current issues or films that take a political stand. But in the Cracker universe, we expect the characters to act like humans, not caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this movie are portrayed in a completely stereotypical way. They know-nothing hardy complains about everything, treat the locals like crap and cheat their wives? one of them even succeeds in less than 5 minutes to do all of the above. I honestly thought I would change the channels or something wrong. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't stop there. We are constantly reminded of the severity of the war in Iraq? memories that have nothing to do with the story and appear virtually nowhere. The killer is so scared of how Bush is worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to continue with the murder. But more to the point, he is such a mouthpiece for the author's political views that he forgets to act like a credible person, and so we ?? as an audience ?? Don't buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial-kill soul. <br /> <br /> I can't say it ruined the show for me ?? It's still good TV, better than almost everything in the genre (mainly due to Coltrane). But its constant politicization made it impossible to be as good as the real Cracker classic like "To be someone"? An episode that was just as issuey, but one that was treated with much more subtle and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: Non-round panhandle is a disappointment, but what's worse is her replacements. The whole police department? filled with such great characters for so long - is now full of vanilla. Completely interchangeable policemen who have any and all personality (how can you drain Coupling's Richard Coyle of personality is outside me, but it is missing here.) <br /> <br /> There are also moments where the show is lost has. His credibility to me. One such example turns to Fitz to limit the entire Manchester population from one million to one hundred, based on some very strange criteria (French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows?)? He not only succeeds in doing so, but he succeeds in less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was a little disappointed. It is recommended to watch, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. However, if there are new series, it will all be fine: I am convinced that McGovern can still write good things and maybe now that he has his politics out of his system, he can write about people again.
