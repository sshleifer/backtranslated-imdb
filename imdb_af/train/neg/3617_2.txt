Really, really bad slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes from an asylum. Three years later he killed a sociology professor, end of scene. One semester yesterday (hey, that's what the title card said) a new sociology professor is at school. She makes friends with another female sociology professor working there and starting with another professor. The students are all bored, just like us. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title cards that indicate how much time has passed. Screens are pretty short and cut differently to other characters, making for little progress. Many scenes include characters to walk and talk, or to sit and talk and serve little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes the unclear passage of time when we see a body for the second time means we ask ourselves: how long is that body there? And, at least one of the dead doesn't seem to have been missed by others. <br /> <br /> The killer succeeds in killing one person by sticking her in the chest, another by stabbed in the cross, and another by cutting her forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The box cover has a cheerleader: there is no one in the movie. The back cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown that threatens a group of women in a dormitory. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but nobody ever wears such an outfit, and there isn't such a scene. The killer is strictly one-on-one.
