This is the kind of movie everyone should be involved in. Poor directing, about the top play and a plot that touches nothing but showing violence. I thought when I first saw that it might be a satire of the media and how it shows violence, but it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone is doing his worst ever. From scenes where Woody Harrelson's face for no reason morph or Robert Downey Jr's terrible performance as Wayne Gale, a reporter who looks completely bonkers, this movie is a mess.
