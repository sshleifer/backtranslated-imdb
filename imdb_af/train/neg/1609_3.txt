The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that part of his life. It contains too many unspeakable battles and Che serves too many indiscriminate injuries (remember Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never comes to Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guessing what. It contains too many unspeakable battles and Che serves too many indiscriminate injuries. <br /> <br /> When I realized it was supposed to be an "epic" (I never knew anything * but the title before it started) I naturally thought of the biggest epic of them all, David Lean see Lawrence of Arabia. More of that. <br /> <br /> Not to be a racist, but apart from what I've already mentioned, the fact that there are too many characters that can be well distinguished - unknown Spanish actors who watch The same, especially since they all wear "Che" beards and all carry Che-fatigue. This does not allow the viewer to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role). While del Toro is great, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only noticeable character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Because the Other characters are interchangeable, this leads to a loss of reference. If Che's top aides are murdered, you don't feel repentant, because you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think it's a fairy tale), there is no empathy for the audience. He's just dead. <br /> <br /> He is too one-dimensional to relate to man. Apart from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral justice, the only thing we learn about Che is that he is married to five children (he tells another character near to the end). What was his motivation? A complete mystery. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Soderbergh is deliberately on Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never let us know anything about Lawrence, the mystery of Arabia. But anyway, Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and co-workers (Guinness, Quinn). He was as courageous as he was unsafe - it had human traits. Che is like a machine, about as hot as The Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongolian. Che makes Mongolian look like It's a wonderful life.
