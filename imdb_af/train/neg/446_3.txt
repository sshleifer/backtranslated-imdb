It was disappointing. It started well enough, but if it went on and lost every chance, it got flat. Maria Schrader's play is terrible, which never means what she says, or even to know what she says until she says it. She did not show a real emotion, not throw her beloved or her mother's story. Looking at Lena, she has little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There was never a real relationship between Lena and her mother, except that her mother had a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hanna's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich√© as they came, and at least failed. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a stupid finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and whatever Lena had or did not do to influence the outcome, she would have had a sense of complexity, a haunting appearance, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the movie had any depth or spark. It was very difficult to care about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she get him to the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation for that.) If every reference to him is removed, it won't be noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story made confusing by poor character development (who was whose mother, again?) poor acting and director who made everyone appear to be acting. You can almost hear "silent on the set!". I started thinking it was a 7, but if the movie did, it quickly dropped to a 4, and then earned a 3 after the consolation of the wedding. It was about as cold and sterile a movie as I saw. A horrible waste of a good story.
