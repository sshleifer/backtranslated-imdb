Camera Work - Why does the camera in this movie work so jumpy? This is irritating and distracting. Editing - the flashes of the still pictures were too short. Many of the other scenes were too short. Net flash. Sound - the background music was far too loud and covered the voices. One should not rewind and play to catch what was said. No one looks at these things and lets them do it again. Please reduce the volume of background music in the future. Is adjusting the relative sound levels the work of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot had too many loose points. The basic story line had potential. I think the movie needs more work. Was it rushed? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started well, but just came to the end. I really don't understand it, you know you have the storyboard before it goes into production, so why not all the loose points in the storyboard are taken care of. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so critical.
