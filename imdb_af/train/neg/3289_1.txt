I will tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need a big screen recovery? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors such as Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, taking out all the music and making it a drama. Do you think they would like it! This movie did not feel the same as the original one. Certainly, the original was sometimes a bit corny, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get in trouble, and their main purpose was to get people passing through town. to help. Neither of the things that the people who made this movie, they may never have seen the original show all the way. My big question is, what will ruin them next?
