It is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used to make this joke. I don't personally give some way to finding Jessica Simpson and her talent or those so many people fascinating about her. Like a movie, it is something that will not even get a pass rate in film school. The script is a mess, the play is horrific and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") makes me wonder what the hell he thinks. He shouted "Old School" to cry out loud! It's not even in the same state as my "Old School" DVD! For whatever reason, don't see it! I see there is a remark that it's so bad, it's good, but it's honestly too good. When will we stop seeing singers who can't of course try to try, I hope to end soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. Regarding the plot, it's almost non-existent and so poorly done and written (yes I know it's another rehash). I have a lot of doubt that anyone will remember this. Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for the ACTIVE players involved in wasting their time using this bomb. Jessica Simpson you are beautiful but stick to the song, although I'm not a fan of it either. And anyone who did this movie wouldn't put it on your resume. 1/10 because you can't give a zero.
