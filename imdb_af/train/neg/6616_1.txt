I have to tell you right in front of me, I'm definitely NOT an authority on Bollywood movies and just saw a handful. However, if you never saw one, DO NOT start with this one! I really enjoyed the one I saw in this one, but I just couldn't stand it. I must also tell you that I couldn't finish this movie - it was so annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the movie. He is even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks - which I never believed would have been possible. He is so # @ ^! # Irritating !! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it was meant to be comic relief. Instead, he just grabbed my nerves and wanted him to be slow ... dying! His voice, his ways and his irregularity - he just didn't seem to have dominated every scene he was in - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had the incredible ability to evade AK-47 bullets with ease. I don't kid you - there was a scene where several unarmed guys had a small army of guys with these rifles !! And they avoided again and again taking a single bullet and storing the ruffians !!! It made Stallone's performance in "Rambo II" everywhere! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so gray-darn hard, in your face and intense - it made my brain almost practical !! It was as if the film was made by people under the influence of meth !! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivation made zero sense ... nothing at all! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you're the most fiery action and Bollywood fan, you can stand this movie, but I can see why it's on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad !!
