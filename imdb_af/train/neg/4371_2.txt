After leaving TV's popular "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts gave the movie a brave trial with a series of perfect but matinee-pleasing comedy vehicles. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", filmed on the cheap (like most of Knotts' movies), is much worse than its others. Don plays a small town schnook that is accepted by Astronaut training camp ... but not as a space travel candidate - they want him as their new keeper! Some may say that the poor satire capitalizes on Americans' fresh fever for the new era of technology, but the movie is really just a dull excuse to preserve restless children. It starts out well, with good setup and nostalgic places, but it is becoming more and more idiotic and idiotic. * of ****
