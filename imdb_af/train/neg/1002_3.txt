I don't want to go too far in detail because I can't really waste much time reviewing this movie, but I had to give an alternative opinion hopefully to help people avoid the movie. The animation is crud and the story varies between boring / useless to very annoying. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, it's NOT an action sci-fi or something like that - it's an attempt to hit the comedy and have the humor worked after it was translated. It was a total effort to watch this movie, and a terrible way to kick off the film festival, especially in the light of how excited I was and how open I was to anything - I didn't have a Ghost in the Shell - follow up expectation, but I expect something entertaining, and it simply has not achieved it. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Cinema's Journey instead.
