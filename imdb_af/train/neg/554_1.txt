This movie is terrible. The script is bad, the text is mediocre, and even the sex scene is worthless. The excitement and plot of the original film is completely lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, shadow and monochromatic style (a low World War). It's so disappointing after the beauty of the original movie. Greg Morrisey's breeding character shows a facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are terribly lacking here; the few that exist are merely anti-climatic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell continues faithfully in this sequel, but that's not enough to make the other shortcomings. The only circumstances under which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be made will be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
