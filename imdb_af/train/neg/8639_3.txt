Routine tension thread over a sociopath (Dillon) giving his sperm to a human reproductive clinic and beginning to harm the lives of the woman (Antony) and his husband (Mancuso). Highly predictable, far-fetched and undecided shows all the way. Don't lose your time with this one ... rather make a baby!
