<br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie on Cinemax, I was shocked that it was made. Cruel intentions, in my opinion, were one of the best teen-oriented films made in years. This prequel had certain things contrary to the original. (Sebastian's father married in wealth, why did he have a rich aunt on a long island?) <br /> <br /> Then I discovered today that it wasn't really meant to be a new movie but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. After hearing this, it seemed to me that it was not the same as the movie, just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer is in TV format. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably added the end of this movie after the series was not recorded by Fox. It looks like something that will happen too quickly (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where to go with the next episode, as it won't lead to the 1999 movie (What's the newer end right.) <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't like was that it suggested Sebastian and his father was loyal to the wealth, which is not typically looked into well in this area of ​​New York. , and Sina Katharyn's mother was just a mature version of her. It didn't seem as if something a woman would do in her position would marry a man who wasn't her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel, it's pretty lame. But I would like to see where it went as a series.
