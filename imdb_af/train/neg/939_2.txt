I loved the Batman television series and looked forward to it a lot. But they tried too much. <br /> <br /> Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to repair the batmobile was beyond me. I don't want to beat Burt or Adam for the way they look now. It's been 35 years since they appeared with Batman and Robin, but to see how they were dressed in dress suits and to fight 'badguys' was kind of sad. I'd rather have seen the comments of former stars. The batmobile side story was stupid. <br /> <br /> As far as the back movie is concerned, I think it was too short and out of order. It was really a quick review in my opinion. I'd like more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute just to tell the same things I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and had to smoke the penguin, though he hated it and was a former smoker. That was it at that 2. <br /> <br /> I'd like to read the book. I'm sure it has more to it. Like why there were 2 puzzles or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. As I said, even the one in this one was scarce in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really corny.
