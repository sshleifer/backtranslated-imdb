1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I titled "3 Days of the Condor" - so a CIA drama full of leaked performances made for a very relaxed performance be. Movie. The premise of the story turns about 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group dead with Robert Redford's character, code name = Condor, the one left. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford is trying to figure out while trying not to be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, he gets involved in Faye Dunaway's character, originally because he needs a place to hide, and eventually helps him to a little love-baptism time. It's one of a handful of innocent guys, but this doesn't have much tension. The flat performances do not help and the finish does not seal the agreement for the audience. Despite a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be.
