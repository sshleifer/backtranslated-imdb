<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides which category a movie suits, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. Regarding the story, it was quite interesting, but quite slow. However, I was extremely disappointed at the end. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on earth does she cross over to her uncle's house (?) Without calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what's going on, plus she has a videotape as proof. Instead, she goes over there and starts nuts and says, "I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect evidence, did you?" Then she surprised when her uncle got up and began to walk to her as if he were going to do her. Well DUH! Of course, he's going to harm your idiot, just tell him you know everything and have proven to expose everything. What a stupid end.
