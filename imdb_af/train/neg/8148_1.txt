Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything Brookmyr's first novel had. Everything except the story, the laughter, the black humor, the political plot, the characterizations, the plot and a little sense. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful ends from the beginning. They made a mockery of the plot, they had a romance between Parablane and a policeman, and what did all that happen? Dr Slaughter was portrayed as a bystander, and who was Annette Crosby supposed to be? <br /> <br /> They seemed to have made a three hour adjustment and then cut it to 90 minutes. (Although the 90 minutes are forever.) Please, don't do this to any other Brookmyres books, especially the Blind country.
