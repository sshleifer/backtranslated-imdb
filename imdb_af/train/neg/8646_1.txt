It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm going to get up and go to Tape 4, but I'm sticking it out. I now consider myself a Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the chief actor (George Calil) was particularly incapable. Apart from the bad acting and zealous camera shake, I thought to use the events of 9/11 as a reason to make "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, over a screen near you", shameful and disrespectful to the victims of 9/11. Using a call from Larson's wife, Sarah, presumably from one of the terrorist planes on that day, was frightening. The camera did not make me feel sick, the cold heartbeat did.
