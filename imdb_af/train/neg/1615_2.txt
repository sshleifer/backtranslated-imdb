The same old guy about Che. This completely ignored the very interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg saves the same boring story of Che. The stupidly seductive story of an Argentinean rich boy shocked so much has become a Robin Hood fighting the poor until he is finally killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, it has heard everything before, HEAR AND WITHDRAW !! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak, who openly wanted to put Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that he begged the Soviet Union in the hottest moment in the Cold War to call New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world. CHe encouraged Khrushchev to start a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life he declared that if his finger was on the button, he would have printed it. When Khrushchev backed up and literally saved the world, Che was furious with the "betrayal". If Che's recommendations were followed, you will not read this review now. How a murderous maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting movie. Unbelievable that no film maker has been enough to show the right side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. It will make an Oscar winning movie! I thought to make autonomous film, which means you have to take real risks and GROUNDBRAKING! They just like "safe counter-culture themes", "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatical and stupid", etc. ... ad nauseum. Oh, how daring, how spirit blows. Three anti-mainstream and edgy. I wish they would have real cojones and tackle the Independent Oligarchy of Independence! It would be really daring!
