Not the best of the movies to be watched today. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and expected it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and surroundings were good, but here was no story. There wasn't a moment of fright. I expected it for a horror-thriller movie, but there was no horror. The only scene I was scared of was during the chapter change scene "Wednesday". There are many fragments in the movie. Most of the things are left inexplicable with nothing to link it to something. The story doesn't tell us about the women or other scenes shown. Can be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not for the 21st century.
