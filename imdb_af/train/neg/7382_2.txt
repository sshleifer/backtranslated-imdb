Well, let me say that I've always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually good, but it just doesn't measure up to the rest. It is, in my opinion, very silly, I do not love it all. The biggest reason I don't like it is because it's very wrong and doesn't make much sense to me. The acting is very bad, even Steven seagal is not doing well. The rest of the actors I can see are because they just go to video movies. It does not follow a straight line, everything happens immediately so it doesn't make much sense. There is almost no action in it and to make an action movie good, you usually need an action. The special effects are very bad and you can say is false. All in all, it should be the worst movie of all, so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie, don't rent it, just as it doesn't. So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ** from ********** <br /> <br /> * from *****
