Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly expected to watch this movie and find out more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was unfounded ... it did not provide any background on its life, no historical context, nor any of its great writings (except for a brief, reference to the cost of discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the film. ) Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the states) and relaxing with his friends before deciding to go back to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands up for his faith. Instead of highlighting it, we are having a very bad performance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether it actually happened, it should not have been a big part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part, or a narrative explaining what his writings are about ... or to let us know a little about the greatness of this man. drum roll ..... wait ..... .... wait ..... ZIP code. Nada. This is the kind of movie that "Christian Films" gives a bad name. All they had to do was structure the movie to follow, with some background ... even a voice origin or flashback to him who preached from his works ... a little about who he was and where he was. But no ... this is what we have. Almost fit for a hero of the Faith.
