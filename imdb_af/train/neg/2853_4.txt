Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a boss who leaves a spiritual institution back to his gang of gangsters. How can a director play a role with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very beautiful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and such a waste of time? This movie is not a funny comedy with a film constellation. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Prazer em Matar-te!" ('Pleasure in kill you!') <br /> <br />
