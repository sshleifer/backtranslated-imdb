I was looking forward to seeing this movie long ago, after seeing "Back to Paradise", which I found satisfactory. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable end I think was partially stolen from "Back to Paradise." <br /> <br /> Maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I didn't have Dane's character and first and found her very annoying. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see anything realistic about the movie. It could be done so much better, for example, there could be more emphasis on prison conditions and the mere horror. It was too strange that a movie was realistic. There can also be more action and tension <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" end. I couldn't have predicted it. But by that time I didn't really care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
