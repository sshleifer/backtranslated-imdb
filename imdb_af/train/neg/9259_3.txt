'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a sequel to the original 'The Omen' film. Instead of Satan holding a little boy's body, he has the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who are bullied at school and eventually revenge against those who do wrong. The movie seems to be struggling with any horror factor, and many of the events that happen are simply stupid, rather than terribly frightening. It is hard to believe that this girl is Satan, even all the events surrounding it. I didn't find this movie very exciting or scary, especially when compared to the original.
