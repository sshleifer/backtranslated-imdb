Really, very bad. How to make a movie that made this bad? I've been waiting for some relay plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some free nudity, but I have nothing. I just looked at Cabin Fever and I thought it was a train wreck (except the nudity and pancakes), but it looks like genius compared to this drink. The best script doctor in the world could not have saved this spooky pile of smelly poo. <br /> <br /> The only thing going for this "movie" is that it ended. <br /> <br /> I have a headache, just think of this movie and try to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid just $ 5 for that and it will land in a landfill shortly.
