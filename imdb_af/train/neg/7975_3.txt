While sitting in front of the TV, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with it!" Chances are, you will too. It starts with intrigue. A British park keeper who lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth), marries a pretty, crazy dark-haired woman (Lisa Zane) who first met in a park for a short time. Then she disappears one day. The police can't find any documentation she ever existed, and Firth does its own search. So far so good. Just as he was going to give up, he turned to his best friend (Billy Zane), and they bumped into her earlier life in LA's sordid underground drugs, nightclubs and amethyst movies, and then to her history of spiritual instability. . At that stage, Firth's life was in danger and the film fell apart. Not one of the characters of Lisa Zane's past is remote at all. The film is moving slowly, and there is very little action. There is a subplot about missing drug money, but it's just a throw away. No chases, no rocky rows and no tension. Just a few dull strokes and lots of chats by boring characters. One thing to note, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear together in a scene. By the end of the movie you are torn between what is wondering and waiting.
