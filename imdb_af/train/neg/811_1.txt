The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. And although I know that successors are usually not as good as the original, I certainly didn't expect such a bomb. The romance was flat, the face gags old, the spoken humor just wasn't. It may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's getting close.
