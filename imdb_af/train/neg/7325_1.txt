This makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is the jaw that falls into how scary it is. Turning off the DVD player was not enough to do. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face. I'll never get that time again. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and hilarious film? I couldn't think of an action plan that would relieve the tedium. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful piece of cinema. What more can you say than repeat how terribly the act is. Please avoid.
