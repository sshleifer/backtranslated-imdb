I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close-up shots ... no landscapes and very little background shots) was absolutely horrible. I watched it over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I felt I was 114 minutes away from my vacation. Not recommended by any imagination.
