This is a direct follow-up of 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940), because the main character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and relates to the story (with the help of archival material) after his son's fiancee. There are only two unusual aspects of the film: the early death of Banning, and the presence of Turhan Bey. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney as the mummy Kharis gets the best bill, although the nature of his role is given, he has a little more to do than to cross or to hit his arms. There is nothing scary about his presence, except for his attempt to perform the fiance, Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran gets second bill, but is killed within the first fifteen minutes! We have to wait for 'Psycho' (1960) when a main character (Janet Leigh) dies before the end of the movie! Banning's girlfriend of the first movie, Babe Jenson (now Henson), shows up a lot, much older, and does not do any of the comic texts he did in the original. It's hard to believe it's the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting work is being wasted because, after only two short scenes, Kharis is murdered. It is then left to Banning's son John (played by little player John Hubbard) to lead the hunt to the cemetery - NO! The sheriff leads a torch that moves to Banning's house to burn it and kill the mummy. Sounds universally known? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey is introduced to audiences like the new high priest, Mehmet Bey, to care for and feed tana leaves to Kharis. With its 'exotic' voice and appearance, it's too bad, it's being killed so easily. A better movie would have had 'Babe' take Von Helsing type control of things in tracking the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead we rehashed a pedestrian of various sets of previous Universal horror movies, composed by hack Griffin Jay who wrote many of Universal's other clunkers, although he also did "Don Winslow of the Navy" (1942) as well as Don Winslow from the Coast Guard (1943) who also detected Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six Joe Palooka movies (1946-1949), and of course, Turhan Bey, with 43 movie and TV credits, is awesome in the title role of The Amazing Dr. X (1948). <br /> <br /> The cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with many noirish shadows in the sheriff's office) than the first 'Kharis' mummy movie, but there's little interest or excitement. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 3.
