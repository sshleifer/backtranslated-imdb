I didn't watch the whole movie. I couldn't watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after I watched for half an hour and I suggest anyone think they are watching themselves. It stops themselves before they take the disk out of the case. <br /> <br /> I like Mafia movies, both tragic and comical, but Corky Romano can only describe as a tragic attempt to be a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is just trying to make the audience laugh. The plot is an excuse for Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely overplayed and has subtlety or credibility - all his strange ways come across as confronted - Chris Kattan is clearly 'acting' rather than playing a role - it boasts you straight from the story. Every scene is completely predictable, the "comic event" that will occur on the set is evident once every scene is launched. In comedies like Mr. Bean is the disaster caused by the title character, funny, because you cannot empathize with the characters' motivation and initial event and the situation in which the character ends. However, Corky feels that he deliberately explains in a desperate attempt to make a laugh of the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris didn't play such a strange character (which never really connects with the other characters) and whose behavior was completely inexplicable (except for trying to draw) and the comedy screens were Not as predictable and stereotypical - all the jokes were too familiar) this movie could have been watchful. But it is not. Don't look at it.
