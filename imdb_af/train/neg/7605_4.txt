I think "Gunslinger" wasn't quite as horrible as most of the movies that "Mystery Science Theater 3000" show, but Western is not Roger Corman's forte. Pictured Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becomes Sheriff in an Old West town after her sheriff man is murdered and has to fight bad things, the movie is pretty predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, secretly working for Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). Also briefly, Corman's co-star, Dick Miller, appears as a postman (Miller these days in Joe Dante's movies). <br /> <br /> I would like to claim that you probably want to see the "MST3K" version To really enjoy this movie. They had a good time with it.
