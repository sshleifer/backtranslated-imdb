My friends and I went in this movie without knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we got out, we were only slightly more informed about what the movie's plot was. Although not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely don't recommend spending your money watching it in theaters. Perhaps a friend has rented it for you (it's not even the rent, either) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so complicated you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there's really not much that can be said in its defense. The acting was decent, more than you would expect from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all trapped by a lame plot and poor writing. <br /> <br /> This movie was really so bad that I bought a ticket as soon as I got out to see a good movie just to clear my mind. I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and see a good movie.
