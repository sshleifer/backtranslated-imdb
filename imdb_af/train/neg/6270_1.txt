Somehow, a woman with a scientific work puts a metal sphere in people's mouths that change their personality, but in reality it turns into crazy, moody killers. The experimental "roommates" are slenderly dressed, naughty young women in desperate need of acting. This movie is terrible, horrible and incredibly bad. It has little or no logic in the writing. You will be really hard to follow what is going on. It has no special effects. The computer screen that presumably represents a great scientific advance seems nothing more than an old Atari screen. And what's even worse is that there is also a puppet with rhinoceros rays (looks like a lonely child at the summer camp, it called George). It's like a personal servant / confidant to Jessica (the leading actress). Throughout the movie you will be subject to the idiot, sophmoric expressions of this puppet. But wait ... you also get very soft, unrotic, barely naked scenes with the girls with some bartenders. All the time, a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background, like some kind of spiritual discovery. None of the actors is good. There are only varying degrees of bad. The gore and horror aspects are filmed especially inactive. The movie really looks like an adolescent brings it along. No coincidence Henry Sala, the director named but not by trade, made another film. I was almost bored in a coma who watched these stupid, stupid, drunk! And how does it end? What happened? If you know, leave me in secret, because I can't live it for my life. All I know is that I have lost the time to watch this garbage that made the start of my weekend a real nightmare of a drill!
