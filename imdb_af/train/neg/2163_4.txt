Shame really - very rarely do I look at a movie and are disappointed in the end. I've seen quite a few Ira Levin's adaptations - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and they both liked them, but it just didn't address me. <br /> <br /> When I read read plot sketch - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to kill one of his former pupils (Christopher Reeve) and steal his writing for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but everything I "Say, there are loads of twists and turns. So much it's hard to detail the movie's plot line to explain, without giving it away, I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before the turn and turns started and at that stage my interest and enjoyment began to fade, although I have to give Lumet credit for the very amusing end that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The lead roles - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles, although Worth's obvious fake Russian accent got a little on my nerves (nothing personal Irene, I think any actor's fake accent would annoy me.) Not sure if Cannon's character was meant to be annoyingly funny, but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain at the same time. > <br /> Anyone reading it - I don't want you to turn it off, because It's because of my views - give it a chance, you may like it, you may not. It's all about opinion.
