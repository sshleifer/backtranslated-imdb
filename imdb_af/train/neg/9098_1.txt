There is a reason why some movies go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if it's too naughty for the theater audience, then be released directly to the video. Of course, it's really not fair for the movies that are good and yet they are also released straight to the video. This one is not an exception, although the film has good actors or at least potential actors: Amy Adams (Oscar nominated and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who better or at least a better agent and Sara Thompson plays deserve a deviation from teen melodramas. The movie was also misplaced: this film takes place before brutal intentions, so this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid to it. It was a waste and it is really a movie that is on the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation movies. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to delete it from their CVs. So if you want to see something naughty but don't have the courage to buy porn, then rent this movie as a starter.
