Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a border-cop-American-Mexico. He serves as a father figure for young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants Mr Savalas to be the best man at his approaching wedding. Savalas is difficult, but boss Eddie Albert (as commander Moffat) can be harder. Tough is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Alliances can be in flood. <br /> <br /> If you get the opportunity to hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas", which are explicitly mentioned, you should disconnect the "Border". If not, you may not have the stomach for the "realistic" battlefield. Although not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) the show. <br /> <br /> ** Die Grens (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
