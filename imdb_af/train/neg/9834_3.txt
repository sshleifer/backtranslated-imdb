One of the more 'literate' Lone Stars, with the time spent on character development and interaction, dialogue and acting affairs. The openingstone sets the stage (literally) for the personality of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his friend, John Scott (John Wayne), the rodeo (says Roh-Day-oh) star, both are slightly Randy. The film follows their adventures, as they are best trying to strive for each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita, and later in their quest for Mary Kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he was seduced by the right villain, and want to repent). And oh, of course, they are wrongly accused of two crimes and must serve their prison before escaping and eventually being liberated. <br /> <br /> The high point is Scott, constantly and deliberately Maria's buttocks in her grocery store, and knocking away the leather she's standing so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. It all looks a little contemporary to a 30-year-old, but it sounds better when it is. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are lacking here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad use of stock images of horseback riders. No George Hayes. Tedious Stooge-like bi-play between Scott and Charlie, while Charlie swings to Scott, Scott bangs on his foot and then strikes him (twice repeated!). The skilled Paul Fix is ​​in use. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really credible as a curvy sidebar. The villain looks too old and fat. So, Chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an unredited meat loaf. Mary Kornman, from the 1920s "Our Gang" (see 'Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but it's about it. Seed of a better western lie is buried here. <br /> <br /> P.S. The ultra short-colored version, which looks good, moves so fast, it's over when you flash more than once. Fortunately, the terrifying scenes were cut with Eddy Chandler.
