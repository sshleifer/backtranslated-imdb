"Nada" was the most inadequate follow-up to "Les NOces Rouges" emerging as the last good movie of Chabrol's golden era (1967-1973). "Nada" is Chabrol's first attempt to be a complete political film. his previous work, "les Noces Rouges", also had political elements, but it was more a psychological excitement with the ordinary view of society in the French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassador, hostage, lots of blood, not exactly Chabrol's field.A heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce: only Duchaussoy, who has already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel is scratching . Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("la Belle Equipe" "Panique"), <br /> <br /> This is a second period of barren inspiration for Chabrol. It would be 'Violette Nozières'. before he was at the top of his game again.
