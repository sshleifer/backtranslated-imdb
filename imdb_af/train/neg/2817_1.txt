Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest fly that the horror genre has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved the Texas Chainsaw, but I think that in order to put your name on a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie. I can't really think of any other Hooper movie (on its own, don't count Poltergeist) that really made an impact on the horror genre or movie world. And this movie, Night Terrors, just makes me back. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit to do at least a good job with the terrible material he was given. He did what he could. What about the movie itself? Pure drudge. Unnecessary naaktonele every five minutes, a story to be written in a us, and actually only terrible scenery, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie is redeemable. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10. I feel sorry for Hooper, his career seems to be over before it really started. I hope he can pump out at least one good movie so he can do justice to his cult status. <br /> <br />
