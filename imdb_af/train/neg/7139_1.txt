Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious, without any of the redeeming features. It doesn't have to have a complicated plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it just needs to! This is the equivalent of a porn movie, where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that it's worse because you don't get the value of your money. Enthusiastic boring, impossible races and a terrible waste of expensive cars, which have almost negative points for appearing in this movie. Sure, she's hot, but who's desperate for a woman on the screen? I feel like the director is sitting there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets, and shaking an 8 ball every time they change screens. No serious person who races or knows about it will see this movie and enjoy the screens.
