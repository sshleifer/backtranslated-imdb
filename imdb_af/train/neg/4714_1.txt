I want so bad to give this piece of GARBAGE zero. Unfortunately, it is not necessary, so I had to give it a 1 to warn you of how stupid this cheater is of a well-known cartoon! The characters look like they were drawn by preschool students, no, wait, I've seen preschoolers do better! I prefer "Misadventures or Flapjack" to this horrible excuse for a cartoon! I probably say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember that episode of Dexter's Lab when they ran go-karts in the volcano? Yes, even those ideas have fallen and failed! They even tore Shadow Lugia in the one episode that Pokemon parodyed! (He even entered that franchise!) The one character is a cheap cut off of Mandark's Dexter's Lab! Mister Fellows must be sued for statutory offense for this piece of crap !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who are testing Johnny (RIP-OFF) are just for yourself. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this rip tries to scan your screen!
