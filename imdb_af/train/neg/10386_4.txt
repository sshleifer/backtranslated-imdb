It could have been interesting? A Japan-set haunted house from the point of view of a newly installed American family ?? but fall flat because of an over simplified treatment and disability of both role and director. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from the same problem I often experience with the popular modern renaissance of such a native prize, that is, the spirits prove themselves to be evil without any reason other than what they expected! In addition, does it not yield much in the frightening department? A giant scratch attack is just stupid? since the ghost generally has a specific character and allows him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic manner, such as Susan George, the Doug McClure family diplomat / friend and Edward Albert, who has his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At one point, an old monk appears at home to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there? Eventually, he is encouraged to drive out the premises. However, history must repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation created properly ?? leading to a violent but inadvertently funny climax in which Albert and McClure, who are owned by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, participate in death in an impromptu karate duel! At the end of the day does it become an innocent time warmer? tolerant of just 88 minutes, but by no means essential viewing.
