It had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentator, who said the special effects were okay. I found them very bad: it was just not realistic and they were so fake that it was only derived from the real story. Perhaps the derivation is the reason why I do not fully understand the story. The archaeologists are looking for "the set". They do not bother to tell what was set or what is so special about it. It also makes it unclear why they are looking for it in California, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you shoot a movie that takes place in the desert, it is hard to go to the desert. The beginning - the old ceremony - seems to have been shot in a studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> The action level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. It made the movie look like, and it's definitely a pro for this particular movie.
