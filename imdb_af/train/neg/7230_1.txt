I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I made a movie that combines these three would be nice at least. I could no longer be wrong: the story (or the lack of it) was completely uninspired and imaginative - while imagination is usually the greatest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porn movie. Thomas Kretschmann in particular gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance'. Bad action would not have been such a big problem if only 'director' Bilal did not take him so seriously; all the lines sound as if they were poetic, it seems Bilal really thinks he made a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry in this piece of junk, just pretentious! This guy really has to keep making cartoons, as he fails on all accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics seem so fake that they even look like werewolves in 'Van Helsing' like live actors! And since half of the characters are CGI animated, it's quite a problem that the CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods actually exist, Bilal is a dead man, for they will undoubtedly have an abominable vengeance on him for the ridiculous way he portrays them in this disastrous bad movie.
