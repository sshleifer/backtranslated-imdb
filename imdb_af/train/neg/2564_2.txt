If I were to watch movies, I would stay and see if I didn't like it, I'll go to bed, but it was pure crap, I really got up and got out! .... It was poorly written and set. together I hated it. Also, they didn't have to take Brendan Frasier off, he was much better. It wasn't as good as I expected, as I really liked George from The Jungle 1 and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example the bird, and then he crashed into a tree. I hope the director will pay attention to this, and he must reconsider the next movies he makes ... horrible! I really want to do Ursla well, because she made the movie worthwhile (until I ran out). Overall I give this movie a 2 out of 10
