<br /> <br /> One would expect a movie with a famous comedian starring to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed aloud all over the movie, and it wasn't even during the final comedy scene (which would also be the funniest). It's one that you can watch when it comes to TV, don't spend any other money to rent it.
