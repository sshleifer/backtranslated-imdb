It was almost worthwhile to sit through this whole god-fearing "movie" just to know that I can never experience such a bad thing again. Acting - 0, essay - 0, battle scenes - 0, male head - 0 (eight mile cheddar Bob as a suave war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She's beautiful and not a terrible actress ). These are the criteria I used to average it in two. I was lost, but I believe ever movie clich√©, ever, is in this movie. When the driver who supposedly killed her father acted miraculously to run against her, it did not confirm the previous statement from the past. Plus he just shows for no reason. He has never been mentioned before. I don't know what to say yet. Just watch it come on TV in a few years. At least that way, some of it will be worked out for advertising.
