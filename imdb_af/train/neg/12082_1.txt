Oh, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, this version is drowned! I don't know which of all people put up the money for this navy, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama. This version is pretty literally so bad that even the presence of a big thespian like Maximilian Schell in the title role can't save it. This film's only redeeming quality is that it made good feed for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had much to do with this one. <br /> <br /> But I'm sure Shakespeare, if he was alive when he made it, didn't want his name associated with Dit. This "Hamlet" isn't even that bad, it's good; It's not bad. Absolutely terrible.
