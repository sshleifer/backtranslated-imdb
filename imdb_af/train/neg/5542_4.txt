Well, first, if you check the revolt of the Zombies as a very early Night of the Living Dead (1968) movie, forget about it. It's about "zombies" in a more psychological sense, where that term is merely an indication of someone who is not in control of their will but who must follow the will of the other. The "zombies" here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for submission to the state or authority in general, as in the war. It's quite a piece to call it a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film was introduced during the First World War. A "French Cambodian" contingent heard strange stories about zombification - presumably Angkor Wat built using zombies - and there are stories of zombie armies that easily conquer enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back a priest who probably knows the secret of zombification, but he won't speak. So Louque and an international military conditional head of Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information for zombies, have a chance to wipe out the white race. <br /> <br /> One of the strange things about the uprising of the zombies is that author / director Victor Halperin seems to have decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. The movie starts as if it will explore the zombie / military metaphor, and perhaps even adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story. <br /> <br /> Halperin stick with a sub-text about will and power (and a Nietzschean "will to power"). The movie is interesting at that level, but the writing and editing are pretty good. It's another older movie I wouldn't be surprised to see if there were missing footage, especially as some scenes even fade or cut while a character expresses a dialogue. <br /> <br /> Amidst the confronted novels, Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the mystery of zombification, but that doesn't mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material is vague and confusing. Halperin even overpowered to use the backdrop of Bela Lugosi's googly eyes from his 1932 movie, White Zombie, but never explains what to do with anything. There are huge gaps in the plot, including the love story. Promising, interesting characters from early rules disappear for long periods. One potential villain is done indifferently before he can do much. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of old, creaking B-movies, Revolt of the Zombies can be worth watching at least once. It's not that bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can gather an interesting story in your mind to fill in all the gaps. But it's the second time I've seen the movie, with the first one being about five years ago, and I barely remembered it - so it's not exactly memorable.
