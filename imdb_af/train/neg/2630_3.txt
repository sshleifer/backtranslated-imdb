WASTE WARNING! ! ! Personally, I don't understand why Pete didn't help Williams's life. I mean it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think members of the secret service are everyday people and there is a rumor that the author was a member of the Secret Service, now his motivation is clear, well-known. But as a rental, this movie will not satisfy you, because the old man uses turns, the average acting - these are just things in this movie, just to keep you waiting for the end. Clap Johnson as the director of SWAT did a much better job this time, and I still wonder how the producers (for example Michael Douglas) left this movie to theaters.
