I rented this DVD to see it while looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I couldn't believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and loved it, in fact admiring Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I watched this movie for 30 minutes and had to turn it off. I don't know if I can take much more. On a superficial level, the faux accent, as others have commented, is at best delivery and irritant and weak. The play is boring when it has to be passionate and comical when it has to be serious. Lou Salome's portrayal is simply flippant, and the brilliant Freud comes out as little as a schoolboy. I see so little of the book's spirit that has been transmitted so far. I was hoping to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I'll refer them to the book. Imagine.
