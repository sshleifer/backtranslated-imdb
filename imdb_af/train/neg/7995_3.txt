I remember remembering to watch this movie when I was young, but couldn't recall the title and then go through horror movies. I find it and think of myself. "This is the title?" This movie is a kind of combination disaster movie / insect attack movie with less notable stars in it. It's also a bit boring, as it has the television atmosphere where you can blur the movie for advertising and such. The plot invaded this type of resort by ants. I think they have a little disturbed by construction or something that is happening in the neighborhood, but don't quote me. The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole movie was the first to include the child falling to the pool, and of course Summers attacks. What else stands out in this one is the very good end where survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, like most television films, this movie is very soft and not very scary at least unless you panic at the eyes of ants.
