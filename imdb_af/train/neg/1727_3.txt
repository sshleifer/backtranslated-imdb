We have a lake. We've collapsed an animated meteor. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay, so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE SAMPLE. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief". We also need a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this movie and who nobody listens to. Aw crap, we're past halfway through the movie and we forgot to put in a bad guy! No worries, let us suggest a guy with a mustache, let him rob a shop to show that he is a bad guy, then let him appear somewhere near the lake, make him rush through the forest and all this for the sole purpose of him. as dinosaur snack food. It must work. <br /> <br /> A full, clumsy mess, this movie. His logic will turn your mind around forcing you to laugh. The first movie known by Dave Allen as a "stop motion supervisor". After this one, he has teamed up with Charles Band for years until the mid-1990s when Band ran out of money to pay him, I think. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole movie is inadvertently funny. Unfortunately, it's about the only good thing that can be said for that. <br /> <br /> Good Bad? Yes. The sensible logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
