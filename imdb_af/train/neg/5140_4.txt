Demer Daves, is a wonderful director of western and 'broken arrows' staying in everyone's mind. As for melodrama, he has to leave it to know people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The script is so predictable that you won't even be so surprised if you look at such a low tepee. Natalie Wood's character is inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who can believe she is a black man's daughter anyway? Susan Kohner was more credible in an "imitation of life" and Sinatra and Curtis were given such stereotypical parts that they could do nothing with them: the poor officer and the affluent, beautiful and sergeant. who will fall in love with Natalie? France is shown as a country of tolerance, where interracial unions are warmly welcome. By that time (about 1944) it was doubtful, it is still for the meticulous people you can find here and everywhere. .
