... the child actors were annoying. It also seems as if the makers on this movie are struggling to fill 90 minutes. Good screenshots, though. If it's not for the screenshots, this movie will have a lot of Disneyish feel. <br /> <br /> The main characters didn't look as rare as they should have been. If I was in the middle of the forest with a dental feast, ghost killer type individual, you could catch your ass. I won't wander and drive my bike. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've seen worse (ie, wait), but it's nothing I would like to see again, or recommend someone to bother it unless you're a keen horror collector is.
