I've always kept Fred MacMurray, and although her career has been tragically cut? I think Carole Lombard is nice to watch. Join these two great and attractive stars, add top supporting players such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic screenplay, team them up with well-known director Mitchell Leisen and get a mediocre movie experience . <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet cute" during her visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpet, so he starts a musical career, which is predictable meteoric in both his rise and fall. During his climb to the musical stars he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start again after hitting the rock. Oh yeah? It's the true Hollywood happy ending that nobody gets too soon. <br /> <br /> Stars and a director of this caliber should ensure success, but this movie is so predictable and slow that it is difficult to watch at times. The early scenes in Panama are so foolish that it seems forever, and later an alcoholic skid will endlessly go astray in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the tired writing and the S-L-O-W direction do not give them a chance. Even the last scene in which Maggie encourages Skid to get rid of alcohol and disappointment just doesn't call it true. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen once to see some early star performances MacMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee that it will look about 48 hours.
