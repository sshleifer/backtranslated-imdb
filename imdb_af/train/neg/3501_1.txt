I understand the jokes very well, they are just not good. The show is terrible. I understand this, and that's another terrible thing about it. The only cool character ever seen was that one in one episode, but then I see the other episode that includes the episode and the show is terrible. It's not funny, not funny! I don't want people to say, "Only smart people don't get it" because if they are so smart, why do they judge people they don't even know and say they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it ? It's like saying, "The sky is red" but never looking outside. But anyway, it's absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just awful, her controversy is very lame, her fiery jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids is really stupid and usually consists of very bad plays. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others if they don't even know about any of us is not really a clever comment.
