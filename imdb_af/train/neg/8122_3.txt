Painful to look at, not quite for empathy with the struggle of the characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia's mother and Monica, the recognized daughter, spend most of the film, pathetically flourish and bitterly, on each other. Their characters are so determined that their salvation in tolerant personalities to a fast family cathedral is incredible. It wasn't worth the wait. I wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to watch.
