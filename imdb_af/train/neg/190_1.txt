I always felt a good movie should have a plot. This particular movie lacks one, and I feel it would be more effective with a plot. This has been made worse by the fact that it seems to continue; I was anxious that it would eventually end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes; It feels like four hours. Not only was there a plot, but the film also lacked a significant conflict. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I said it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I hate most action movies today; It's just that this movie is on the other side of the spectrum. Not much happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.
