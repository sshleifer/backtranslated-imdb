This movie is another Christian propaganda movie in the line of Omega code. Not that it is necessarily bad, but that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to deliver. If you enjoy a styrofoam depiction of street life and the way the gospel can change a life, you may enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade of The Mission. When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals being portrayed who are not allowed to swear (huh? Criminals say bad words?) And flat characters that I really can't meet. Also, it would have been great if the movie showed some T&A. Now it's something I'd like to pay to see. Who was the blockhead comparing this communion-thin story of a movie with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
