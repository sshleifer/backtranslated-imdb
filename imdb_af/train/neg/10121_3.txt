Bored London's Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (such as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to travel. Their lives become more exciting as their relationships begin with exotic Betty Amann (for Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms Barry). But they stay as boring as they used to be. Alfred Hitchcock, probably bored, is trying to name the well-titled (as in the movie, Shakespeare's "The Tempest", Rich and Strange "), through a couple of camera trusts. Vidor's "The Crowd" is the highlight. The low point can eat the couple on the Chinese prepared cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
