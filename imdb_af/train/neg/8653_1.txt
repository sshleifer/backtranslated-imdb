I went in this hope it would be the "thought-provoking" jewel people reviewed it as. I love indie movies and will also expect to dig them. To know what a hot button these topics are, I'm expected to be really entertained, maybe even an outsider perspective. <br /> <br /> Everything I can say is wow .... if you are self-assured or mutilated, then maybe you will like it. Personally, I don't like the idea of ​​touching or cutting myself, so I thought it was rubbish. bad writing, bad acting, bad story, bad direction, bad editing .... i can continue. I have no idea why a reviewer claimed that he or she made a political point by giving this movie a 10th which is misleading and ignorant. vote for a movie on IMDb don't set a precedent! It just makes other people think that such a garbage bomb is so good to watch as long as it is controversial (this movie is not, it is trying very hard to be but failing). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad when it's 15 minutes in your prayer that all the main characters die horribly. Unfortunately, they are dying, but not in the painful ways that the viewer would have fair or just because they watched the 2-hour shit they just endured. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't even bother. I got this movie in a bargain at my local video store for .50 and feel ripped off!
