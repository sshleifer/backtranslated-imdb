I start writing this review during a break while watching the movie. This is the first time I've tried it, but I'm struggling to get one without occasional breaks. This is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> This is hardly boring and unbelievable, especially when the forward-dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) tragically and bitchy, self-supporting and self-pitying. It would have been a much better movie if they just left that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very annoying melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they couldn't make Ryan credible, they just made him unnecessary. The problem with this is: Who cares if a spoiled, shaky, petty jerk dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character goes for him is the fact that he is dying and sorry, but it's just not enough. No one dies specially. We are ALL dying, sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while playing like a push. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, and the actors they play (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pitying interruptions, would be a lot made better movie. But it's not over yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe something big happens before the end. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. This hired turkey goes back tonight!
