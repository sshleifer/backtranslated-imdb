This video was initially banned in Britain and left without cuts in November last year. <br /> <br /> It contains the Playboy playmate of the month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. That opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle images. I'm not sure what its purpose was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathing place. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in ransom in the jungle. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) is continually blowing. <br /> <br /> The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura walks into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of the Dead) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortable. Peter leaves them and goes out alone to find Laura, who is already trapped. They pass the time to have sex and do not see the danger that comes closer. Guts, anyone? Great battle between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, dapitation, intestines, very full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess) and the line, "They rip her heart out," which is hilarious if you film see.
