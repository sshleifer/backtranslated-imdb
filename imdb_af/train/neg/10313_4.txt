This movie was hard to hold, and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the wonderful stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man benefits from the unsuspecting airline industry and goes away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or trying to dangle. With all this built-in interest, how can one make such a thin, talkative movie of this true life event. While Williams is always interesting, the authors accepted that the D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, but what we get is a type without any interesting details or insights into the minds of a person who is enough and clever enough to subtract it. Harrold virtually steals the movie with her spunk and sheer beauty, but the real decay was in handling the plot and lame direction. Shame on this movie for even existing ones.
