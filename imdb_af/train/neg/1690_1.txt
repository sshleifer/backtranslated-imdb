this movie was terrible. I could barely stay awake by that. I'll never see this movie again if I'm paid. The so-called horror screens in it were increasingly predictable and over played. There was really nothing about this movie that originally made it worth the $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Don't see it, don't rent it, don't read it online because any of these will be a total waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller had a lack of performance and should be ashamed to relieve her good name with this movie. Sorry for you, Sarah, because you're associated with this horrible, horrible movie. Horrible movie, never have to see it.
