It seems like it's the only movie John Saxon ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it is boring and wood, with nothing much for it. A Vietnam war hero is taking a job for a boss, getting a little too friendly with the woman and then killing the woman herself and killing the war hero in prison, specifically for the prison sent. Now, this particular prison is experimenting with prisoners and is testing a formula that will turn people into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then all these infected people are trapped in jail, some of which turn into zombies and the rest that just suddenly no longer wants to be there. It just goes on and on and with nothing more to show or say for itself, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed to come a few times, but no, it just seemed to be on a different and equally dull path. If one looked at the end, they might become a zombie themselves, so don't risk it. 2 out of 10.
