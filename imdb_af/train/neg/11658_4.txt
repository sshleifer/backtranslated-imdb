Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 movies because there's not much of a plot, bad acting, pretty boring and a few cheesy jokes. But. And it's great but there is one good actor, one good repeating joke and a good start. The good actor is Tim Curry, the one good repeated joke is the creepy, weird butler with the disgusting hand always doing cringey, but the worthy things are laughing. And the good start is the spoof of the Excorsis. <br /> <br /> The plot of Scary Movie 2 is the main characters of the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay at a creepy old mansion at night, but will survive the night. ? This movie is not very good, but if you are bored, it might as well be!
