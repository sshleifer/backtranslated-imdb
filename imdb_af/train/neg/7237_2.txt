Life is really too short for movies like this. I knew it would not be good if I realized what I had suspected - that David Schwimmer was playing exactly the same person he was playing in 'Friends'. <br /> <br /> Let's see it doesn't matter if the man can play anything but a nerd or he's never offered other parts. I have a feeling that it is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I have to say it is very difficult to keep a movie that completely wastes the significant talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol. Kane !!!
