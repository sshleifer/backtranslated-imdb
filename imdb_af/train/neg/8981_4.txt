This Paramount version / ripoff of OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not as unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro commentary can be there to save what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundtrack and like a live TV show. I do not find the use of the background cyclorama, relieved in different scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or .... all that innovative. As noted, it seems to me more like a movie produced on a TV budget: All soundtrack, with minimal sets supported by the enabled bikes! (Compare with new facts (from 1952), however, the actors come out pretty well. And this style is much better realized when Paramount shot in 1959. In movie price, this movie suggests the often-repeated question: "what were they thinking?"
