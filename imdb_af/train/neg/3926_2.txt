This Italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was rated "R", but the real band said it was "X." The latter makes much more sense because there was a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you can see that Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers performs all sex on this man - and yes, you can see his penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "main character" had done something like that on the screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes, but her face was even better than her body. She looks pretty. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly .... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite Detmer's body.
