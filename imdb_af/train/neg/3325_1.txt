Hated this. If you believe that everyone in the South is stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a religious note or a child molester, then this movie may be for you. Everyone is poor and apparently ignorant. In one scene, two older men talk in a general store and one mentions that he has molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man was proud of his actions, and the other man clearly saw it as a normal part of life. Very pretty. A teenage girl walks the back roads in search of her sister and no one offers her to help - despite an obvious slack and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only disgusting and clever, but he is shown to be a religious believer who reflects the typical nature of Christians. A scenario in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro). Bible verses are mocked by the bad man. I am from the Great North West but found this movie offensive because of the wonderful people I know of NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc. Is.
