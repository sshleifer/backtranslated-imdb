It's not so much movie as big budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a huge swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans. This theory appears to be verified by the fact that the subtitles call it 'Insomnia'. When it is first mentioned that a civilization was wiped out by insomnia, I thought, "Wow! A Nihilistic martial arts movie!" but no luck. Although you should consider the experimental theater when the villain is strangled by an old man's long white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same amount of sentence whether the captions are on or off. This is not a good sign. I found that the special effects existed somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
