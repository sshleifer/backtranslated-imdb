The whole thing is very nice to look at. The European location shooting was a good idea. The protagonists are attractive. The count is serviceable. <br /> <br /> BUT THERE SPOKEN! And the non-plot developed! And it was already off the mountain. Pacino sleeps and Keller likes how bored she is. Hello, dear, you're not alone. When he does a Mae West imitation, you may have to hide your face, it's painful to look. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved, or a better question, why did it stink so badly? <br /> <br /> Since death is somehow represented in every scene, it's possible that you have a little pleasure here. Maybe it's supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can't recommend it.
