I wanted to keep this movie, I really did. It has some good actors, but eventually it falls flat. It's trying too hard to be funny in some places (the girls over diligent cooking), reaching out to others (the scene where they clean up someone's garden, so he agrees to join the team) and has a few Scenes that, in fact, are just stuffing (all the work scene's). And I didn't intimidate the "villians", or worth the hating, as much as I found them to be childishly irritating. <br /> <br /> I met people like those in the movie while playing church ball. And I will say the referee is on the point. But in the end I didn't care much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. Maybe because they were all one-dimensional, which I might not have thought so much if the movie was better or a little more smooth. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm entertainment made good movies, but none of them.
