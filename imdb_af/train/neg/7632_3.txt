Many people see it as a classic, but of course I must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty boring - which means a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will also be pretty boring! What is it that so many people see in this? As soon as the last picture in Anarene closes, there will really be nothing in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes the point at the end of the movie. But even before closing, there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there isn't much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to hone the local high school soccer team. Three times something happened that I thought would add some sparkling drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens as a result, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) sneak, but nothing really happens because Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnapped a girl but nothing really happens through it. The only thing that added something of dramatic value to the movie finally came to the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) who really shows the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town. The men stand to debate the body where to go for breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed it in black and white. It's supposed to point out how gray this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Herder, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (Aside, it was scary to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - really looks like his character from Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I do not think so! 10/03
