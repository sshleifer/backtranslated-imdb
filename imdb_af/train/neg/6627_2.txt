What happens to RGV? He repeats himself in every movie. Did he run out of creative ideas? If he has time to sit. Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I think it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promotions said it all. But even then, I thought it would be a good HSR treat, because he is not the same man who managed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after looking at Aag. I'm not talking about the plot or the story, since most of it is taken from the original, if you really die to see this one, you can play a fun game with friends: identify the screens of the original one and Give your own ratings! So Veeru becomes Heero (how lean is that?), Think Lord won't sound that big. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster like Heero, the comedy is tense and the slurred talk really effective in the company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more beautiful Nisha is trying to become the irritant she becomes. It reaches a peak at the end. Raj is not really bad compared to the other, he's a guy to look at in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl that is covered in a scarf, instead of the fear he offends, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only show that really stands out was Mohan Lal as Narasimha Inspector. I'm afraid I don't have the patience to write more.
