KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I remembered from BOMB) was my introduction to cult director Honda's work; this one is not necessarily better ?? It's just that I learned to be more tolerant of such an intrinsic lowbrow price! <br /> <br /> Here we actually get two Kongs for the price of one: an ugly and dim giant monkey and a robot variation of what looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where it is shown to fight a few other monsters and befriend a trio of people. Of course, it falls to the blonde (and mere) heroine; In fact, more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the movie's rogue mad genius? He calls Dr. Who and the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampire! <br /> <br /> He kidnapped King Kong and hypnotized it for the Element X, embedded in the icy North Atlantic waste; apparently, the giant monkey is more impenetrable to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and to ensure its full co-operation, capturing even its three 'companions')! The female agent then has a heart failure, helps heroes (one of whom is typically a non-written American) and is murdered by Who. Kong eventually escapes and makes it to Tokyo, where it has a final confrontation with the robot. The doctor flies the subsequent chaos into his sub? who, at the request of Kong's dream star, suddenly lost sight of the giant monkey.
