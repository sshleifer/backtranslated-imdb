Being as honest as I possibly can is the devil's plaything (or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or ????) a complete drill. The movie has a good starting point behind it? the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through help and assistance from a group of women dressed in black? but the execution is terrible. There are big, long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters stand with nothing to do. There is no mystery, no tension, and no plot points to surrender. The acting is simply uncomfortable. Most of the plays include a group of below-average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And what a little plot there is designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can participate in the dance. While it's not as bad or useless as the dance or plot in something like Orgy of Death, it comes close.
