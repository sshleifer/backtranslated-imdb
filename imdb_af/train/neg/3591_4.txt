First, let me say that I am a great believer in Fanpro things. I see it as a way to continue with a good performance long after it's canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a soft spot for fanpro stuff which means I will overshadow things that I would normally look like. <br /> <br /> So to ST: HF. Well, first of all good things. Enthusiasm is an important part of making any show credible and most of the crew of the various ships seem to have a good time with their roles. Next, the effects are not bad for a home brewing effort, with nothing to really make you win. The stories aren't bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough and at least there are constant story bows. <br /> <br /> But it has many errors. <br /> <br /> First of all, though they are quite natural to see HAVE Star Trek footage, background, music and effects, I see no reason why they have made virtually every other sci-fi music game. Everything from Aliens to Starship Troopers lends this band head to some point. Likewise, much of the material is from other movies, conscientiously CGI'd about to make it look different. The Gray Warships, for example, though disguised, are of course Star Destroyers of Star Wars. And the station is also quite clear Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga by Starship Troopers. Similarly, sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, as well as animated footage. In one stage in the first or second season, I think you see even two TIE fighters flying past during a battle, barely promoting your suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> The action ranges from the reasonable to the terribly painful to watch. However, as the seasons progress, everyone improves, but expects it to catch on the screen, especially in the early seasons. They also made interesting acting choices. Let's just say that the food manufacturers appear on a cake permanently on a cake and leave it immediately. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects are generally quite effective. But they should actually mercilessly kill the person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than background or "passing" shots. They are just outside unrealistic. Every time I saw one of these things (except to laugh too much), I expected the unfortunate soul to pull out a gun and announce "It's a stick!" In one scene, a "Cardassian" actually speaks while wearing one of these. Not only do the lips move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone must be slapped for that. Couldn't take a knife for that, for the sake of good! There are also some things done, but unintentional, funny makeup works, like the Herman Munster body. <br /> <br /> Although coherent, writing is nothing new. Instead, the script continues as a continuation of DS9, with the ships heading for different missions from the DS12. The new enemy, "The Gray" is not very threatening and the plot line they are dealing with is effectively a rework of the Borg wires. ie Star Fleet meets the Gray, the Gray is extremely powerful, Star Fleet barely escapes with their lives, then they start using tech ways to find the enemy etc. to fight. All that was done with the sponsor before. <br /> <br /> Another disadvantage is the dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to write "technobabble here in a script. It usually outlines the latest plan to combat the enemy using" quantum phase discriminators "or" isolation costs "etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you they are on the issue and there is a solution available. <Br /> <br /> The words are really gibberish. I have no problem with that but where ST: HF " making a mess of it is where they include real comments in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice like "We need to regroup" sounds good, but not when it is expressed by a trio of characters already in " Similarly, when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to answer: "We count three battleships." He actually had to count them? C'mon! to ask him, "Are you sure?" or "Can you double check." But my all-time favorite comment is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we set up two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Commissioner: "No, we can only send and receive .. <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> With all of the above, the performance improves as it goes. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it gets significantly better. Season 6 has been reasonable so far. <br /> <br /> However, I have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though. Quicktime sucks, honestly and the sooner they move to divx / avi format the better. Some of us actually love our downloaded apps and watch it on decent size screen and don't look at a small QT window on a computer monitor. Not only does Quicktime make it difficult, but the 320x180 resolution that the shows are not good at. In fact, it makes the shows unavailable, as they were a tenth generation VHS tape copy. The least they could do was include a hi-res downloadable option. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show has promise, and I even start to like the characters. But it's up to 40 episodes, so I'm not sure, it says so much about character development. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free .... <br /> <br /> PS: From 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... were we the same show? Or are you 19 already three years old?
