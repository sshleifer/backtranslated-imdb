No one, but no one can chew the scenery like the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" are a good example. Although she sometimes judges, look at her when she talks about Raliegh about a song that her ladies are going to play in the waiting time. In one moment she made us realize how Elizabeth really could rule and rule. ! At other times, she's done the script's sappiness. When Elizabeth must be vulnerable, she comes off as weak and sharp. This has the effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her and threatens to reach justice, it's hard to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn has charmed us, showing us how Essex could worm his worm away in Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally improper to convey the man's complexity and mere evil. It also doesn't help Essex to be poorly endorsed. Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen - even if he swears faithfully to her - except he is more blue-blooded, so more "worthy" of rule? And why does Raliegh Elizabeth expire by intercepting her and Essex's letters? He has no risk of falling out of favor, and we know where Essex (and his head) is heading. So why does he strike his own head by speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz provide with all the info he did? He doesn't even bother to hide the fact that his scenes are being shot on a healthy stage. He had to end it alone with Elizabeth at The Tower for the first time; everything that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
