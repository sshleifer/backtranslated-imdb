One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bored me so much that I had halfway through to watch the news. When I turned it on again, I fell asleep. The movie starts with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are a few more dreams in between. Come on, what is it that I'm interested in? A movie should have a reason to be interesting. The moment you felt the movie was just a dream, when a sensible filmmaker turned off. Has anyone ever demanded to tell your dreams and what it means to them? This is it! <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
