Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic. However, it was a great disappointment and I was really angry about what Disney did. <br /> <br /> BBC's Planet Earth was all the above and more. It was subtle. It had an overall sense of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and profit. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> It's Disney's editing of the Earth. They tried to make it a movie that our Americans would talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They put a top music count there to scare us. They made predators angry. They made WALRUSES angry. They showed every encounter as negative. It tried to be tension and success, but at the expense of the lesson of balance. The movie was one hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive. <br /> <br /> I'm all out to avoid global warning, but it was above the top political and environmental rest. <br /> <br /> It's another thing, I've seen it on the big screen, but was disappointed in picture quality. It looks better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see such a thing and get the whole picture, the BBC's Planet Earth series goes out and buys, buys or lends. It's better lessons, better sound, and (if you have Blu-Ray), better picture quality.
