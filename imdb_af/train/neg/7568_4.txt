Chan Wook Park is nothing if it is not inventive. I'm a CYBORG, but it's a little fun with little technical prosperity with some ingenious ideas sprinkling in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATSEN) begins with a fanciful, light-hearted story that is a radical departure from his usual morbid price. Hardly anyone who is offended for his ambition or his vision is really unexpected, to see that all of Park's efforts have so little to do. <br /> <br /> I'm a CYBORG, but it's OK, it looks surprising that subtracting itself as it goes along, with the end result a fraction of the sum of its parts. The point of departure is promising, gags are abundant and indisputable humor is abundant, but everything fails to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and cute and played with a gusto through the cast, but try, as I might, I couldn't take care of myself. <br /> <br /> SIMPLY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a slip, which might indicate Park has left itself a bit, but still showed some of the directors unique flare and in the aftermath of an impressive filmography. Forgive it easily. None of the assured self-confidence commanded joint security or symptoms for Mr. VENGEANCE is clear here. I'm a CYBORG, but it's OK, disconnected me so completely. I instinctively caught myself from time to time (more often than the film progresses). I gave LADY a 5/10, and according to the benchmark it probably doesn't earn more than a 3. For the time being I will be generous: 4/10
