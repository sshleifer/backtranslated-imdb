Shouting provides for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Don't overdo it - this movie has taken all four of the above elements brilliantly to make it into a real movie. <br /> Okay - shhhhh but I'm going to discuss special effects here - or a lack of them - <br /> <br /> Did you catch the underwater scenes? It seems to be poorly filmed by an aquarium. Note the hood that flaps in the breeze. <br /> <br /> And the repeated reuse of stocktaking, (outside shots, bridging scenes - greatly enhancing the KRAF-Tiness of this movie - not since "PLAN 9" - I have such creative use of stock <br /> <br /> And hey, where there was a lack of special effects - don't worry - scream the place of special effects in this movie too, yes, this movie even has that old hack trick use. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - put your brain on (several fermented drinks help DEFINITELY), sit back, and wonder: why did they put it back on film? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
