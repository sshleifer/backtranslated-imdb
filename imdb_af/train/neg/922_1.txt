This movie is exactly what you get when you really stretch your abilities, it's like someone who just passed the ride test and then put them in a Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can't add the US Grand Prix, because everyone can come out because of dodgy ties and you can only win), that's how far this movie falls short. Don't take it wrong, I love B movies, about half of my collection is made of B movies, but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. <Br /> <br /> First of the story (for a B-movie) is not that bad, it has the potential to make a B-Movie brand, and does not speak 13th on Friday, but potential no less. But what really made this movie off is the play, and not one second I believe, it's like watching QVC, except that the providers on QVC tend to have a heavier tan. <br /> <br /> In summary, I'd like to say I've seen worse movies, but I can't.
