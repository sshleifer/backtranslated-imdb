was this tim weadows first roll in a movie? The character, leon, is funny enough, but shortly afterwards, the sexual jokes and humor are too stupid to listen to more. Some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know it right when the ads go on. Some movies that do this are American pie and scary movie. scary movie was stupid, and the American pie would not have done well without the sexual jokes. The only role, except leon, that had a little humor that followed is that it will happen. the character was really stupid and that was all, the stupid humor was all that looked at me. the movie was ok and nothing else. I don't really understand why the people who die to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. The sketches last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie of 5 minutes, how about the world? Molly Shannon had superstar, Cheri O'terri had scary movie, but she was not a leading role, and had eleven. but it was good, but he did a stupid movie, but I can't remember, and Mike Myers with Wayne's world. how come the crazy tv crew doesn't ever go to movies? seen only one man break through, but only in like 2 movies and a TV show with andy dick. but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue, funny or not. This movie is not good, but has some positive humor. what a waste of film and people's money. (D D-)
