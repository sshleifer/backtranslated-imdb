Although it made good pressure after playing at the Toronto Intl. Film festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this. One - this is an ultra-low budget Canadian movie. Two - it is written, directed and mainly the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it is Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But despite watching it with lower expectations, it still showed a much greater disappointment than I thought. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - bad writing, bad acting, terrible directing! Don't waste your time or money on this turkey. It claims it's a comedy, but I just laughed twice. In addition, there is terrible music all the time. How it gets attention, I will never know.
