As I said, the book was pretty good and it might have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert wasn't so terrific and unbelievable. What kind of accent was that anyway? It sounds the same as her terrible Russian accent in another movie I saw her. Every time she opened her mouth, I clipped. It took three tries before I could watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other lead. <br /> <br /> I really liked the beach seasonal schools. They added a little needed clarity to think of the Melissa Gilbert's impressive portrayal. However, I think they could have used San Francisco views to their advantage. It looked like the night tones were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I don't remember the character in the book this depression is. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert from any future movies that require an accent!
