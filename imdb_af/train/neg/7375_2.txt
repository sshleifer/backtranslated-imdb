This movie was hit hard by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as I have to say Steven So-sow! Just as before Seagal is too good or too stupid to copy his own lines again, let someone lighten his voice for the shots where the sound is to be hung. A few movies before it was, he did, but I don't think so! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script can work, but parts of this movie look like a real movie! Of course, everyone said, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better without Seagal becoming a cartoon of himself. Don't bother. Anything about a goat for this one is too much! I honestly think it's the last time for me and a Seagal movie. What took me so long to realize it?
