Dewaana as a movie goes through the usual clich√©s. Husband and wife fall in love and marry, man is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family's fortune, the wife's marriage and surprise, surprise man no. 1, appears again. The film reminds Yash Chopra's Chandni and many others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the movements and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain. The music of Nadeem Shravan is wonderful, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the movements.
