I had some expectation for the movie, as it had a nice star match and that is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was reluctant to watch the movie because it was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I'd say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because it was set up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself shook me off. Then the big drawback of the movie is the action sequences. My friends and I laughed at watching these crazy fights. It was like Akshay at about 30 boefies and everyone and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew ... you have to see it to understand how bad the action sequence is. <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the movie is the much too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing worth the movie is sexy Kareena, who looks really hot in this one. And for that I give a score of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please .. please ... don't see this one think it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can see it laughing a little at the terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> That's all.
