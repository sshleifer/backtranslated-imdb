The author puts on a voyage of discovery of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry, believing that the (completely and forgotten) forgotten film "Bright Leaf" is about an ancestor of his. It's not, and he discovers nothing of even little interest in this absolutely stupid and self-explanatory glorified home movie suitable for performance at (the director) drunk family reunions, but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not recorded by large studios, because they are boring, irrelevant and none other than the director and his / her immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
