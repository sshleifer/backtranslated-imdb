Well, after watching it, I can say it's not the worst movie ever made. Yes, people are worse than that. There are some good points to the movie, you are watching drunk teens, having terrible deaths, and cute looking rats eating a scientific experiment and grotesquely growing up, the drunken lawyer, the fiery doctor, and yes a girl in it the lingerie that is absolutely not a pity, stupid stupid, i can't personally wait for the rat to eat this drunk fool, i threw it for the night. It had a good prospect. The first part of the movie was interesting with the scientific exploration of the rats, and the little story, but I think it ruined when the stupid drunk horny teens came into play, the gear in my opinion, the one lost, her name is Brenda, was so fake, had to be a cGi. rat ,, looks like a man dressed in a suit, it was pretty shocking, lame ,, but not quite horribble ,,
