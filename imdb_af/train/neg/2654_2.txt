Although the movie for this movie was admirable, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to turn away. It was possible that we "hoped" that the message would eventually make itself clear, and that we could get something from this effort. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience could "make sense" of this winding story, a credit for the ingenuity of the human brain to make the absurd sense. However, the authors have done nothing to facilitate this innate need. It was clear that those involved were simply going through the movements of their respective craft, and that any intrinsic passion because the characters or the story were secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, television films have come down over the years. While communicating a message to the audience may have been the primary interest of the writers in the past, current authors and producers seem derogatory to their audience, concentrating mainly on "manipulating" us through the incessant advertising that appears to the only reason movies like Surrender, Dorothy are made.
