I went to one of my family for a while, and we went to a theater, so we thought we were coming in and turning this movie into a twist. What a mistake! This movie is terrible in every section. I've never heard of the movie, and literally everyone hasn't. No wonder it is as much as it gets. It's a comedy, so it says, the only thing funny is the ability or lack of the director to make such a movie. To get so close to Christmas, it should be called how to cook a turkey in almost an hour and a half - or how long it was when I went out. At the end of the movie you will feel as if you are poisoning food on a sick turkey and sorry to have wasted your time on such a drop. Who knows why such things are made. Some people walked out of the theater before the movie was over, and I blame myself for not running out much earlier. It makes me really annoying that you pay good money to see something decent and everything you come up with is a poor TV movie to be shown at 2:00 in the morning. It's actually such a bad daytime TV shouldn't show it. What else can a say ... probably not enough bad words can do it right.
