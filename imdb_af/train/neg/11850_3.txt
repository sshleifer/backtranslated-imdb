"Competitive reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to smack each other on stories. The latest is the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a scream from his penthouse was heard. "The two reporters start out as competitors, but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment are inflated," according to the DVD cap's synopsis. <br /> <br /> This said - the follow-up of "The Thirteenth Guest" has little to do with the previous film; it is not a successor, as has been deduced. Me. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but the film is very boring. The opening and closing is frightening. A long-winded dedication of plot development points follows the climax. <br /> <br /> *** A Shriek at Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark
