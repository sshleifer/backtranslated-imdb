A phenomenal achievement in fear. It's really scary awful. <br /> <br /> First ... Nicholas Cage has now made it into the top class in the Ear-Emoting category in his acting class. With new hair plugs and with a face lifted so many times, it seems as if she is pointing backwards to touch the back. Not only does he make a sick smarmiose crop, but he creates a "hero" character with no interest. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes women out to be completely devious and angry ... and pays them back by hitting Kage a few of them directly in the face and a few times a few times several times a few times. times to call **** es. I enjoyed LaBute's early movies and some of his plays ... but it's a strange fascination he has. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a 2 out of 10 based exclusively on Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance (brave soldier through her screens with her wedge line clearly visible on her forehead), it seems as if all hope is lost. She deserves an Oscar here and now to tell her lines with a straight face and when she apparently wears a white mummy and blue, white and gold face paint over The Wicker Man, you know she's with Scorcese and Friedkin work, This roll dang well. <br /> <br /> This movie is so wrong and cuckoo that needs to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bike and looks like me. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz driving there. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage runs around the island kicking off doors looking for the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING of a once-promising acting career in a "brawl" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is dancing around in a mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage shouts: "Who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, Who burned it, Who burned it?" without reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not joking) walks through the woods, takes off the costume (but leaves the bear feet) and then karate moves to some villains. <br /> <br /> And you didn't live until you saw the last 15 minutes of the movie and its terrible epilogue that looked like it was shot in your cousin's cellar yesterday. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can make it through this movie without laughing out loud, you earn a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped wondering if it might not have been an extensive upload of "hysteria" movies ... just to remind when Cage was screaming / shouting / whispering very serious. <br /> <br /> I think this one is destined to be a cult movie again ... just because it's so terrible.
