Phil the Alien is one of those strange films where humor is based on the strangeness of everything rather than the real punchlines. <br /> <br /> Initially, it was very strange and pretty funny, but as the movie progressed, I didn't <br /> <br /> It's a low budget movie (it's never a problem in itself not). There were some interesting characters, but in the end I just lost interest. <br /> <br /> I think this movie will appeal to a stoner currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar but better, try "Brother of Another Planet"
