If you don't look at a horizontally filmed corner of the narrator at a lecture room, watch how he sets up his camera to take photos in different places. It would be nice if you choose areas that fit his subject, but he doesn't. So, you'll hear even more narration, see how a few photos go and watch him set up his camera. Why not use the movie camera instead to show the landscapes? It really makes a sense of pacing and paints the man more in vain. <br /> <br /> I could read tips on how to set up their camera, fast forward through this whole movie and waste much less time.
