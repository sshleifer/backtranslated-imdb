Liongate has yet to prove itself. Every single lion's movie is uncomfortable. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just hold me over and over. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie, it was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Guy cuts a dead dog for some reason. Being infected by random virus, passing it on to children at a camp, children becoming infected and dying, the town finds it and rather than helping them kill them. then the water is contaminated and everyone dies. the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely delayed, you don't care for any of them and one child has to stand with son meet the world. My friend and I found that we were talking about how fat and bitchy we were one classmate, much more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We managed to close it to the end while our bulls scream $ @ t because this movie will make you do it. <br /> <br /> And I'm still confused by the random slow motion karate move of The One Random Child and how apparently everyone in the country is completely delayed and crooked. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why did the child try to kill the cubicles, sit in a chair and wait for them to kill him? It was part of the two of their plans? Wow. best plan ever. I can't believe this movie had a theatrical release. I could barely stomach the DVD, let alone in a theater that didn't move for an hour and a half. It wasn't scary, or funny, or cool, or anything. It's just a waste of 90 minutes you can use to ... I don't know, plant a tree or something. This is more productive than this piece of garbage. The acting, special effects and script are a joke. Never pick it up. <br /> <br /> Fever choir gets one nasty leg pain scene, out of 10
