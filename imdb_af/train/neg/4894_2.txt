Superfluous, eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you will find in this movie. In other words, it was technically poor for me. The musical pieces are amateurishly directed (no synchronization in the dancing, bad post-synchronized, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The movie is long and dull. Ultimately, it makes little point and even less sense. <br /> <br /> However, there are good ideas. Some of the comic elements are actually effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse so it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand at the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, it's not true for the movie. That is, the difference between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a coaching.
