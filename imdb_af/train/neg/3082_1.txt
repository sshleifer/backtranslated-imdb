Good Lord, what did they think? !!!!!! Here's your heater warning, though I don't think it will really matter. A group of puppets afterwards really go to a group of stupid people, who are looking for a dumb hunt to kill them. the dolls complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. <br /> <br /> You know it should be bad even if Mike and the Bots can't save anything! And they didn't! I know, some of their lines were funny, as I would like to add to the board "HIT" and the hand's comment but, geez, it was pretty dang sad. <br /> <br /> All I can say is NOT look at this piece O CRUD. It's not your eyes hurt.
