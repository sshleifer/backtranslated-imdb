After watching this movie, I had the compelling need to provoke some of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fantastic, active actress and Max Beesley was quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, though not exactly original, has definitely shown a promise. However, none of them mattered. <br /> <br /> I don't know what her agreement is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. She slowed down footage, overturned footage, used inverted imagery, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a million quick cuts, jumped and put in the timeline, with a stupid "modern" blaring junk soundtrack. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job targeting a movie. Her ego has to be great to throw out the play and story and put her head in front and center for the audience's members to take note. There are some good scenes in "Kill Me Later" that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, Mrs. Lustig, just when things were going to show the promise, would dig into school pocket tricks and revive things. It's a pity that Blair and Beesley have good chemistry and you can see that the movie really had a good heart. 10/03
