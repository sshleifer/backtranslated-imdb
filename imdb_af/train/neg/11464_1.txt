While I am not claiming any kind of marine life expert, I have to say that anyone with an intelligence cannot possibly buy for this idea of ​​a whale (and not even the mother!) Have an idea about revenge because it testified that his killer has a forced abortion by humans! I mean, really! It's basically the whole plot. Richard Harris had to be very difficult to accept this litter. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you pay 50 cents to see it, you are claiming your money back.
