Much worse than the original. It was actually painful to go through, and it hardly had my six-year interest. <br /> <br /> The launch of some new Pok√©mon is marginally interesting, but the storyline is extraordinary, the dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre. Rather look at the television program - it's much better.
