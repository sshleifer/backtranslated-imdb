In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue with the long man, assisted by a faster-happy 9-year-old, black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's late brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a disappointing successor as the gore and black comedy are much less inspired and exciting as in Phantasm II. I have the feeling that the stress was just laid on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a stand-up comedian. The humor in the previous film was much more dry and suppressed, which suits such a story. Also, the institutions are not so macabre here, and the constant presence of the Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious? There are still many gore, but not half as satisfactory this time. By the way, beware of the severely cut version, as it shows the most beautiful murders on the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime performance of Don Coscarelli, which has so far written and managed 4 episodes. The fifth was in production. The first one is a semi-cult classic, the second is an abomination festival of gore and violence and the rest is easily skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros portrayed his character much better in Phantasm II.
