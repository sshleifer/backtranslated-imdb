Americans are attracting the attention of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the tensions of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really quickly. <br /> <br /> I got an exciting fact from this movie: someone needs to paint high voltage utility poles and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they really want to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I was bored to look at late infomercials and decided to watch this movie really, I have the characters to be interesting and very interesting. <br /> <br /> I don't usually watch so much late-night TV, so I can't recommend this movie unless you're watching paint dry, your idea of ​​an exciting two hours out of your life.
