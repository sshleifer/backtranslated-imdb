Poor Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring it down. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Definitely a once-off pony, I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table here than the Iron Chefs. The kind of dish that this duo really pops up ... doesn't reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don't think Batali even went to chef school. There are many great chefs in America, I just wonder why they didn't appear on the food network. <br /> <br /> It will also help to have more local ingredients and perhaps co-hosts in print. I like Alton Brown, but he's a little too flippant / funny for this role.
