This worldwide was the cheapest man's version of what the NWA did under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s at the localized "Big 3" stations during Saturday morning / Middagwrestling Craze. When Ted Turner got his hand on Crockett's failed version of NWA, he changed it into World Championship wrestling and left all the NWA referrals together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling have been reaffirmed with the WCW logo and moved to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, and have nothing more than WCW Nitro repeat programs, Thursday and Saturday night. Worldwide, the last WCW program under Turner was the WCW buyout of Vince McMahon and WWF this weekend. Today, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive, along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library, generally resides in the safes of the WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
