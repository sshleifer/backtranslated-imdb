Well, it's 90 minutes of my life, I won't be coming back. This movie makes teenage programs "California Dreams" like "Almost Famous". The acting was terrible and story unrealistic. Don't even start me on the real band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, watch, etc. You had to believe they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there is not enough irony in the country. world to accept that one. The guitarist is seen as a heroinist, not that I am guilty of him, if I were such a turbulent bond with old songs and woodworkers, I would also spray the horse. <br /> <br /> If you take music remotely seriously, avoid it at all costs.
