This film is about a group of extra-rural gay blacks wiping women on Earth to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I watched it with the purpose of seeing how bad it was. Yet I was shocked at how bad it was. It looks more like a movie made 50 years ago. The acting, if any, is very bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously fake to make any college movie-watch-mega budget. And the special effects are laughably simple, and indeed the jaw drops off as others comment, but the jaw is frightening. <br /> <br /> One must be very drunk or in a changed state of mind to appreciate this movie. If I was from Denmark, I would be very embarrassed and humiliated that my compatriots produced such a frighteningly bad film.
