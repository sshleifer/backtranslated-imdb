I'm surprised to discover the number of fans this show has. Didn't say that Friends were at best an "average" sitcom, and not as big as others. Let's see it if it's not for Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc's decision. Who knows if this show will last as long as it did. I doubt it a lot. Although the series has progressed, Friends have become more progressively predictable, crippled and boring that I could no longer care about the characters - whoever is overestimated in TV history - or their fate, or who slept with . And it has started to be funny in the first four seasons. And even though it had all these A-list Hollywood actors in the movie world, I still didn't bother to agree. The writing in Friends has turned out to be lost from the sixth season and later interest in this show and for the end Well, it was predictable to say the least. However, what was annoying was that it lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted for only three or four seasons and were eventually canceled and taken off the air for good. The show had to come to a standstill immediately when the money wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series went down, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now there is a friendly reunion show coming to our TV screens soon. And yet I will not look for one there.
