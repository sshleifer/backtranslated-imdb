Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his same title debut, this time it is a movie played for sleeve? laugh. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, hacking her feet as you would expect. Rome immediately after he was hired by husband Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk because he has to investigate certain mafia types, which turn the tables on him and he himself is the main suspect. He must go now and hope to settle the matter alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell the lame jokes and let's believe he is a good detective, and not to be sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails in this ham-fisted vanity project. The honestly ridiculous denial that surrounds every woman is quite amazing. Every woman in the movie is a thunderbolt, who likes to bend over, is in front of the camera. Of course, director Douglas has to zoom in on the cracks of their asses every time. bend their posterior muscles. There is even a ridiculous gay character who believes beggars. It was a movie made by "real men" for "real men" to confirm their own flagship. It's a shame.
