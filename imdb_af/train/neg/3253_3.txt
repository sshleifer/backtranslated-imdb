I actually saw China O'Brien II before ever seeing the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = harder! And funny = better. If you're a bad movie fan like me, it's great. However, if you are looking for any kind of meaningful plot, acting ability or movie skills, it is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequence. Hilariously bathed. Watch it for a laugh, see it for sensible entertainment, but all you do is watch it for free on TV.
