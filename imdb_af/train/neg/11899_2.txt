Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, was lost here on the sea, thrown as a family in New York. He demanded revenge on the thugs who killed his son and attacked his wife in a home attack. Scary topic exploited for cheap jack tension in the Death Wish display. It's not hard to spot these smarmy proceedings: the dialogue is full of crying, crime statistics are irrevocably dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously rewritten (especially a despicable judge who allows an accused killer to walk straight into the courtroom). Low rental production is despicable in its own justice, especially as violence in our cities has only increased. * of ****
