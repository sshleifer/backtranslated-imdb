This movie was just right. I love war movies and can usually get away from most movies and find something I wanted, but it wasn't one of them. This film didn't have dust and intensity. Oh, I got it, the Finns fought one hell and it was wonderful, but the story was badly told. You have no real connection with any of the characters and there is no real story line to follow. You're just going from one random scene to another, nothing flowing to form the story that's trying to be transmitted. If you want a war movie that sounds like you, and will love it unbelievably without fighting scenes, then I suggest "Downfall" (WWII German movie). Or if you prefer a good story line and lots of action, then I suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean war / Korean movie). These two movies won't let you down like the Winter War.
