Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) being chased by a psychic killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And thus her family, friends and her enemies murder. <br /> <br /> Now before I start, let me say you're tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of a silly dialogue "Oh my god" and talk about fiery things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing is you tired of American repeating Asian, Japanese and Chinese movies. It summarily calls Prom Night, but I haven't finished the review yet. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see 'Prom Night' is to kill a laugh. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the killing, but just a scream and you see blood on the wall. And by the way, death repeats like 24/7. Not only is it scary but it is stupid. By the time I met the movie, I thought I was ready to throw. Too much girl talking, talking too much man, and much of 'Oh my gosh. This is our prom. I understand it's fun, but seriously it's too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /> <br /> If I put Prom Night on the list of the worst movies of 2008 without seeing the other movies, I'd be the first one too. I won't be surprised if it's released on the DVD for cheap and fast. Never spend your money or the time for dull action, cheap scares and a night to die if you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give the movie zero stars I want).
