It was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen very bad movies. First, I'm from Kansas. This movie does not have a collection of truth at all. That's how they took BTK's name and made the rest. In addition, it looks as if someone like me has just $ 20 dollars, takes it and made a movie and oh yes, don't worry about btk investigating, just do something. seriously pure dookie, no one should ever see this movie. The battle of cows scenes and making his victims eat things and describe the slaughter of animals. BTK didn't do any of these things, but the movie does it for the love of God, never sees this god terrible movie. The made for TV one is better and more accurate
