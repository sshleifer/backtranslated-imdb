Carlos Mencia constantly, violently, hatefully shouting "B ** ch!" with women is like screaming "n ** ger!" with black people, except it is worse. Remember, the B-word, unlike the N-word, is the only pejorative term still associated with violence. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women hear before rape, beat or murder. This man pursues violence by hatefully using the language of violence. He seems to be a gay man trying to cover women so he will sound like a straight man. And how about all the Nazi whites in his audience who give the fascist salute while their stupid white bimbo-white women have had tea on their side, clearly afraid to protest this flood of women. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia doesn't believe or support free speech for them! Come on, Carlos? do you want women to have the freedom of speech to do you as hard and violent and gentle as you do, or do you think "free speech" is only for men to rape women?
