Alan Rudolph is such a director without the special contact. As an example, there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office that could express the whole relationship between the husband and wife. Rudolph ruined it. The camera is in the corridor and looks through the doors of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each in their respective rooms. You get the idea of ​​their destruction and isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could all be greatly improved. If I directed I would have spent the whole day, if necessary, to get that shot right. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express so much, throughout life, within seconds. <br /> <br /> The shot with the toddler stepping into the pool of puke can be improved. The child had to have more fascination with the puddle, had to reposition and move her feet, had to bend her head to look at the pool with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell didn't deliver. He plays a relentless man, but instead of wearing his inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice telling and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego, played by Denis Leary.
