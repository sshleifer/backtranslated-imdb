Quite amusing piece trying to show how smart Orcas is, but meanwhile (and totally unaware) the audience is foolish by making the most ridiculous movie. Richard Harris plays Quint. I'm sorry, it's wrong, he plays captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for life, but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a murder fish. When catching a female killer whale goes wrong (don't ask) it's partner (don't ask) go on a rampage (don't ask) and start STALKING Captain Nolan (Don't ask). Soon Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (don't ask). Pretty amazing movie-making people here. I have to tell you, the beginning (with whale sounds and nothing else) is pretty haunting and the end credits (with most godawful song) are pretty entertaining.
