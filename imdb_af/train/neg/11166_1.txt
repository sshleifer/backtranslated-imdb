I'm probably deep in Jack Black's statements. The character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious, but no it is. You can tell oh Jacks what a rush of time hammock is, and it plays a smart, smart Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler, but this movie is just a total devastation in every section. <br /> <br /> I just sat there by most of the movie thinking. "Is it supposed to be funny?" and "This is the man of Tenacious D law?" The truth is this movie has nothing to offer. EVEN! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. You will see endless moments where you think something funny will surely happen, but it just doesn't. I was bored for about 10 minutes, but it would certainly pick up. It didn't. 90 minutes later I almost managed to prevent an aneurysm. It was like painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember years ago if you'd see something with your favorite actor in it, even some of them really early early on before they were known, and you'd be really ashamed that the actor actually was in a patch. Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Jack Black's previous films like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but coming to the man. If you do it again, I have to get there and hammer your knees or something. At least give you a serious talk. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons.
