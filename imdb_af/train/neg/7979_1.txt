This movie was slow but boring and the play was often driven into the country of ham. Redgrave's character was unattractive because the 60-or-a-woman who tries to do with Thurman's 20 is something for the love of Fox's character (why is it beyond me). The title of the movie should have been "scarce people on the lake". The actors played as they were in a rehearsal. A strange predictable end to start. I can't believe it's on this site as a comedy!
