THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a bad acid journey for children under the age of 5. For a month my 4-year-old would from time to time ask me "Why did the rabbit bloom from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" (And that wasn't the worst of it). We stopped it in half an hour, but the damage was done. Intense morbid, repressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot about the whole miserable thing. Anyone who has decided should be brought to market to lift children on charges. ... (Check me now, my conscience is clear.).
