Of the three titles of Jess Franco to find their way on the Official DPP Video Nasty List (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), it may be the least merit of infamous. It is a terribly boring jungle gland that is only very small by a small, indifferent gore, a free rape scene, and a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> Beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is kidnapped by a gang of relentless kidnappers and inhabited by a remote tropical island by a wilderness tribe worshiping the 'devil god' in the jungle lure (a large, naked, captivating native who wants to eat the hearts of noble female offerings). <br /> <br /> Work through Laura's agent to deliver. A $ 6m ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam pilot pilot travel to the island, but become troubled when the bad guys try a double cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but walks straight into the arms of the island's inhabitants, offering her to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco directing in his usual torpedo style and loading this ridiculous effort with his usual terrifying brands: crap gore, dark cinematography, fast-paced zoos, numerous crosshairs, out-of-focus, horrible sound effects, and ham-fisted editing . The result is a tremendous debris that is a real struggle to put from start to finish (it took me a few sittings to complete the thing) and even the face of the nice Buchfellner in all her natural glory is Not enough to let me repeat this movie in a hurry.
