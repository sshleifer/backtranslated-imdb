(some spoilers) - as if you don't know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors such as Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every starting point for a big movie is complete. Unfortunately, these things didn't matter at all. The movie was very week-long, without tension and extremely predictable. <br /> <br /> It's all about a lot of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After testing on animals, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once he is invisible, he completely changes and realizes the benefits of not being seen. From this to murder there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. It suffers from the disease that has many new movies: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could lead the producers to a great psychological tension, Verhoeven recovers everything that only focuses on special effects, without relieving the right value of the movie. I must admit, the fx is great, probably the best I've seen since the Matrix, but it's not enough to make a movie good. Actually, it's the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors only care about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is ​​the only movie that perfectly combines fabulous special effects and a good plot. <br /> <br /> Reach Starship Troopers, admonish Verhoeven again. Instead of a good movie, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. The special effects 2. The joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I won't spoil this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Good, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not tense at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- This is too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven just gives the effects. <br /> <br /> - Many cliches. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the bad man wakes up a few times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- As in every low quality horror, the first line to separate the characters is as much as possible. Every time there is someone in the laboratory, perfect victim to Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. For example: Bacon must first scan its finger to enter the laboratory. After being invisible, how can he do this? <br /> <br /> --- The end: absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue Bacon hits the head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin go quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is this normal? Then Bacon came up, attacked them, they killed him again. And then Shue shouts: "I heard an explosion" (happened minutes ago), and they ran in suddenly. Didn't she ever hear that blast? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene where you can see the microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So it's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a good movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
