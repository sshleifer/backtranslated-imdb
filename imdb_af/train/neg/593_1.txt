It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most horrible American foam; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine the author and producer taking large amounts of recreational drugs, and when discussing the plot, it actually thought it was a good idea. it is not. It is a rude garbage of many bowels of Satan himself (who could probably write a better script if he thought about it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, we must be liable for our taxpayers money (lottery money people) on this piece of nonsense. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-create Deathline ??? I ask you - camp as a Christmas tree, Deadline ... "Mind the doors" is classic of really bad British film, we really don't need a memory. And we definitely don't need a bad, two-digit, poorly written, poorly developed and bad piece of waste. All this from the British funding agency that brought us Sex Life from the Potato Men ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Don't pay any money to see it. It is an absolute and absolute shit. The one saving grace for the producers is that they have a big wedge of cash ... our cash ... to make it. They must keep their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I am disturbed by the low, low standard of this movie. It makes me Mgr that our national body for supporting the film actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry while idiots are performing. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
