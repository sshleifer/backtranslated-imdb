There is absolutely nothing to release this movie. They took a messy story, abused it, misrepresented it, it had misfilmed. It has a bad dialogue that is badly done in a winding and sad story. <br /> <br /> As bad as it fails as art, it fails even more than trade. Who could have been the target market for this? Which age group? Which interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone has to make a movie about how and why they made this movie. I paid to see. <br /> <br /> I saw thousands of bad movies, and these ranks with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three most irreparably bad movies I've ever seen. All that goes with it must be forced to talk to VanDamme forever. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise - how can you take it and make it worse? I can't think in one way.
