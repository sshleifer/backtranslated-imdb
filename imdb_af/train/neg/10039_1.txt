This movie is terrible. The action is a waste basket. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Although the scenery is great. I've always wanted to go to Greece. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as for Saif, you'd expect a good performance, but even dropped the people. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar, recognized as the pimp of Bollywood and the voice of Singhs. He was sensational in this movie. For this show only, Filmfare has to award another award. The toiletries award for the worst performance. By the way, the trophy should be a toilet seat. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor. She is not comparable to her sister Karisma in the first place. In acting, in appearance, or in the body. She now wants to prove herself that she is surpassing her. She comes in this movie with bikinis and tank tops and shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan wants to leave his wife-to-dress. But, she must impress some people who dress like this. And if you ask how, do you think every man has an erection, look at this movie. They dream that Kareena Kapoor in the bed was naked with a condom. I included. Personally, I think she's dressed like a whore, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I'm forced to give it a 1/10, but I'll really give this movie a 0/10. An unexpected movie.
