The last mating of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire. The script is poor and is badly presented. The movie has no life in it. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for them. pairing. There is nothing wrong with their singing, it's just all the others in this turkey that is overcooked.
