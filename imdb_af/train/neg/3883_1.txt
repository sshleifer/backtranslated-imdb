No, not joke. It was God-fearing. <br /> <br /> Last night I watched my local Sci-Fi station, which plays movies every night in a movie. This month it is 'Space Turkeys, Or: How I Learn To Worry The Bombs And Love'. Movies so bad, they never had to be made. It was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terribly horrible with two exceptions, the gore makeup (which has shown potential) and the editing (which did slightly the rest of the movie, in terms of being horrible). The dialogue is horrible, the writing, the direction. It is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two types of special effects, gore and stock footage of space. To watch this movie, I thought to myself, "What was the motivation behind making this movie?" People like to make things, sure, but I was reluctant to think anything good. concluded that this movie was made as a way to increase the Make-up Effects guy's Demo Reel. had a good career, and he worked on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), PEOPLE IN BLACK (1996), and even the Indifferent Shrinking Woman (1981), plus a number of other notable flicks. Other than that, I can't say that I actually actually saw a real, living melting man - incredible or otherwise - but I must say it was a fair representation of one. <br /> <br /> When I think of bad editing, I usually think of a scene where someone is talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps to his shoulder or something that leads to it . This movie really does mean that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically, oblong and completely useless scenes. About every scene has dragged longer than it should have, from a little dead air to that crazy long-screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And the head in the river, the head is thrown into a river. The movie lasts for a few minutes and then we cut back to the swinging head and watch it fall into the waterfall. While I'm sure, they were all very proud of their broken head, WHAT THE HELL? <br /> <br /> Finally, I call the running lady / slow motion scene right near the start. The jerking slow motion tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion, but later decided it didn't "work that way" and then delayed it. Oy vey. Anyway, if you ever have to see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman walks in a hall and then directly through a closed, glass door - all in slow motion, think of you - remember the impeccable melting man, because * this * is where it all started. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are best seen at home with a lot of friends. This one is a little slower most of the time, but it's just more time to get your own one-liners. It's not the worst of the worst, but it's very bad.
