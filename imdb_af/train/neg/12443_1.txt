- Let me start by saying that I understand that the invasion of the Starworms was meant to be a parody of the science films of the fifties. I understand that shouldn't be taken seriously. The problem I have is that nothing works. A parody should be funny and this one is just not. Not once during the whole run I tore as much as a smile. In general, I am easily entertained, but I could not find a nice entertainment everywhere in the invaders. <br /> <br /> - I knew I was in trouble from the start. The two "stars" make their screen appearance with one of the funniest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control, they both get wet. These two come out as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why someone wants to encourage the action and the Bowery Boys person is outside me. After the glorious beginnings, the movies feature comic pursuits, dance indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other variety of unfunny pieces. It's all just a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought it on the dual-function DVD with Bee Girls. The movie is Oscar-winning in comparison to the incursion of the star.
