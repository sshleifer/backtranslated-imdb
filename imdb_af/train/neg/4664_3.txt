I voted 3 for this movie because it looks good like all Greenaways output. But it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap. I know many people like this movie, but I got tired very quickly. It's certainly not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took on the role of credibility, but it's really that he didn't have to waste his time. I hate to send someone to the pseudonym, but please ..... !!! On the positive side, it is visually appealing and I enjoyed the music but couldn't see it to the end and I can't say it for many movies. I usually look at the whole thing, but it is unbearable !!
