End Game started well, the least said about the end the better. It looked like things we just do to keep the plot, for example the reporter who is initially a very curious, intelligent person, halfway through, doing something really stupid and out of character, we got no reason for that. apart from, the next scene would not make sense without it. The whole story could be told in about 30 minutes. It would have made an average TV political drama. However, the brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr is very viewable and James Woods is considering an admirable job. <br /> <br /> The end game was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...... and it says something, I've seen Gigli.
