I have to admit that I don't like much of New Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy", I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it can contribute to solving the global warming problem. When energy is "enforced", I always wonder how they succeed in breaking the laws of entropy and still without Nobel prices. When people feel how well instinct they can make life easier, I wonder how they don't do a simple thing like finding the train station. <br /> <br /> But that's not the first movie. With plot holes and most of them I find completely acceptable and entertaining. If that were the case with the Celestine Prophecy, I wouldn't burn this movie, but unfortunately it isn't. Every actor seems bored out of his head and can't understand what he's supposed to do. This leads to many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s" as I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with someone who actually knows what he is talking about and pretends to understand. <br /> <br /> The direction is also not inspired. You might expect more from the guy who says "What dreams may come," but I suppose he paid well for the job and assumed the attitude of a taxi driver in New York: "It's your money, buddy. " The only one who looks like it's fun is the bad old JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this movie who can have some sensible cracks in this eternal and terribly boring New Age chat. <br /> <br /> This movie is much like one of This meal dates when you find out that your date is actually a terrible drill that can't shut. At a moment in time, the words seem to be turned into small table tennis balls that are constantly thrown to your head until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want a good time and have to choose between this movie and put safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
