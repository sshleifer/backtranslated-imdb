I grew up on the 'Superman II' theater version ("S2T") and as a child I love it more than Part I, as it contains not only more Superman and three Superman-type villains, it started with a bang? ? the best Clark Kent for Superman transformations and rescue scenes. Children no longer have to wait impatiently for Superman to appear on the screen, as in Part I. As an adult, I can see how the mighty one fell with S2T. I've always heard of the back story about how they fired the original director, Richard Donner of Part II, early and unfairly. (It had to be a rarity to shoot two different movies at once. Now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 and 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after the Richard Donner Cut (or 'S2RD') "I can't fully recommend it yet. Away, was the wonderful Superman-changing scene, the whole of Paris rescue, as well as the wonderful overview of Part I in S2T's opening. In fact, they all wrote the words:" Previously on Superman? "in S2RD. The special effects weren't big in either Part I or S2T, but S2RD, they were mostly straight-lined like Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I'll admit some new scenes worked and a few who took them out were welcomed departure, like any scene in the "honeymoon suite." Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did and loved it as a kid just like a adult, you should definitely see S2RD because it is almost a brand new childhood experience with decades of new scenes. (Spoiler warning) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: away was also the strange amnesia kiss of S2T replaced with the exact same end as 'I.' It's not just a lazy, unoriginal copout, it doesn't matter why Clark would go back to that night, if the events never really happened. And will he continue to "return every time" for every confrontation?
