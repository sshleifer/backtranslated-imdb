Quite simply, it should not be made. This is predictable and clich√©d. The on-screen chemistry that made the first "My Girl" so engaging is nowhere to be found, and the play as a whole is set and forced. The writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines like a barbaric habit remaining are just shocking. Where "My Girl" has caused a real sense of sadness and some really funny moments, such as many persecutors, "My Girl 2" tries to regain these emotions generated by the audience, and fail. Maybe I'm hard on this movie because of how big the first was, but honestly it insults the quality of the original with the kind of drive that this installment serves. It must surely come close to "Son of the mask", as one of the worst successors of all time. In both cases, the old proverbs are true; "If it's not broken, don't fix it".
