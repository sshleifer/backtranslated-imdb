Normally I would never rent such a movie because you know it will be bad just by looking at the box. At the same time, I hired seven movies, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I realized the videostore man gave me the wrong band. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lamb film. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, the play is bad and the plot doesn't make sense. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie really is about. At the end of the movie you have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> On "Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10" I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I want Correct Corinthian review (right under mine). He says Robert Englund shrinks lingerie, riding horses naked, etc. The man who did those things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not by Robert Englund.
