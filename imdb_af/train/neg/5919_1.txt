I rented this movie yesterday and can barely express my disappointment in little Laura Ingalls to get involved in something so poorly produced. I'm not sure if it was badly written or badly directed or both, but it leaves a viewer very disappointed to waste the time watching this swarm. It consisted of a weak naive story line, very weak lines, and relied only on beautiful scenery and beautiful people to sell it. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. You'll be better off renting a band of static than wasting your time on this shit. Lindsey Wagner also played a pretty pathetic role as an owner of the ranch, which seems to be working very hard to do nothing. Anyone who has ever been to a farm knows that it was obviously written by a Los Angeles young person and not someone with a great deal of world knowledge. .
