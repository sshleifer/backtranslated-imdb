I can only understand why some people might want to emphasize these links over the eighties, but I really wouldn't say it's an accurate portrayal of most people's lives in that era - even on the poorest Bradford estates. However, it is typical of the blunt eight-plug garbage that the old Royal Court Theater was at that time. Plenty of 'straight' artworks for small, small audiences, but plenty of well-linked setbacks to ensure future turgid gaming rights commissions. The simple fact is that if you want to reflect on a more general experience, you will find millions more in a knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in 'Gregory's Girl'. <br /> <br /> I'll be tempted to call it a 'kitchen sink' drama, but it will do a great disservice to the plumbing industry. But as far as having a decent screenplay, this movie is all up to date. For some reason, this has led to a strange result among Guardian read moviegoers - I can only assume they are getting a visual frisson as if they want to belittle it. Star my friends. It's a poor movie with a poor writing that likes to think it's breaking borders by adding humorous insights into the grim life on the estates. it's not .. but it's grim. Instead, do the laundry.
