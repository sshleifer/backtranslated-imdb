Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's Anna and the King of Siam, filmed with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison in 1946, has Deborah Kerr as a widow teacher and mare who traveled from England to Siam in 1862 in 1862 to work as tutor to accept the King's many children - and perhaps teach the Royal One a thing or two in the process! Stagy photo starts well, but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner, who portrays his stage trio as the King, is a striking presence, but used - as a rumored story. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and rates better despite the fact that she has to sink her lips to Marni Nixon's choir. Perhaps he has already played this part to death, Brynner looks as if he left nothing left for the screen translation except bombast. The second half, with Anna and the moppets placing a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin", is pretty ridiculous, and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering. Brynner won a best actor Oscar, but it is versatile Kerr who likes this bauble above water. Longing, heavy and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the term. ** of ****
