* WARNING * contains many SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have a great respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress. Therefore, I cannot understand her reasons for accepting it. movie once she saw the script (or lack thereof) <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie was, in my opinion, a good idea and there were some really elusive themes in it, but it did ended like a collapsed souffl√©. This illustrates why I hate 99% of the British cinema. It feels too long, it is annoying, for the most part, and not much after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there is a chance that it picks up speed, it disappears that Paula Radcliffe runs a marathon. With a little imaginative direction and a minimalist plot, there's not much to make the audience nod in their popcorn. As far as the writing is concerned, I can only suspect that the author has tried to save a few trees, with the average scene following the lines of "Alice: F *** OFF! Read." Adam stares. Adam walks down the forest. follow) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I suspect that the actors probably paid more if Kate Moss did her Virgin Mobile ads. What few lines were not very varied, with regular use of the f-word Bridget Jones' friend , Shazza, would be proud, there is a small settlement of the main characters in front of the heady event that the audience lacks much sympathy for the characters outside an automatic 'O, it's terrible' response. <br /> <br /> Alice is not the kind of woman who sympathizes with courts, she has a good job, an expensive London apartment with roof space to die, but she comes on the screen as arrogant, bitter and dissatisfied before her life turns into a After the attack, a few layers are peeled back, what kind of reason why she started so, she grew up with a solid older boyfriend who thought she was teaching her how to shoot his gun, the ultimate expression of love Instead of following in his footsteps, hardl open his way to the big city in search of something to make her feel that her life is worth living. Instead, she got a group of stereotypical middle-class Toffs that amounts to someone who is not rich enough to manage a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system (which makes Mrs Robinson a will -we-Cockney wide son-electrician) Someone gives me a tissue. The one saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a lesser actress she would have been one-dimensionally unreliable, but Ms Anderson actually manages some brief moments of humanity in this otherwise lifeless person, especially when she sincerely apologizes for her road rage in a vain attempt to prevents her attackers from continuing their assault. <br /> <br /> I can't say Adam did much better either. Danny Dyer played him well as a Jack-Lad player, but a good performance couldn't save him from the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background. <br /> <br /> This movie mostly relied on shock, but the timing was down and it had to be very manipulated from start to finish. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this movie is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become; It was almost as disturbing to watch as the brutal attacks. On a lace note, just in a British movie, a gang of violent sex attackers will take the time to offer each other contraception before encouraging their partners - talk about the tight upper lip to the limit! If it's the kind of movie that the National Lottery donates to make, then I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people choose to spend their pounds each week. <br /> <br /> To say I hated this movie, it gives too much credit, I don't care enough for any of the characters to justify it making an emotion strong. I want those one and a few hours of my life back, please!
