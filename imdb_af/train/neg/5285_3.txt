Someone, on this site someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, they just have to read it. I agree with that. We do, however, like adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike keeps in mind that without good writers it is difficult for the actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well-written adjustment. This version does not compare with the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well maintained and kept the essence of the era and the limitations on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade and kiss in the street scene in Bath ). The 2007 version shows a two-legged Anne who looks fearful. The other characters were not very developed, it is a crime, as Austen can refine such wonderful characters with a few carefully selected underlining. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel was completely beaten and mrs. Smith, Anne's sad and poor schoolmate, walks around in Bath. - Twittering away, as many characters looked. The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which caused Anne to love him in the first place, did not write to Rupert Penry-Jones's Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more dust and could do so much more with a look than P-J could do with his job. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seems to lower the novel into a tangling, bought melodrama of questionable value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional outings into Austen's work, they had to do with their adjustments to Shakespeare: fit it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken from the historical and location institutions and was nice to watch, such as "Clueless". It wasn't PERSUASION, but they didn't know what to call it otherwise.
