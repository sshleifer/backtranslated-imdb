This crap is like being dry. I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it. <br /> <br /> There is simply no meaning to this movie. If it is never made, no one will see or give it. It was picked up by all the great names in it, but if no one was in it, no one would give this love any love. <br /> <br /> I was seriously at the point where halfway through the movie I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Hurry and die already!" It's like the "Joy Luck Club" without any friggin joy. This is the "Ocean's 13" (ie a big name) of mother-daughter movies and totally anti-climate ... o until it's finally over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they'll all be nominated for Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for filmmaking and the ability to convince big actresses to commit this junk.
