SCARECROWS seems to be a bruised abomination that meets supernatural film. A group of evildoers pull a paramilitary robbery from the payroll at Camp Pendleton, California. They have a cargo plane that the pilot kidnapped and his daughter flew to Mexico. Along the way, one greedy robber decides to land the money landed in a maize field, monitored by strange search scarecrows. It's not just a scarecrow ... they can kill. The acting is no better than the terrible dialogue. And the attempts at humor are not funny. Very low budget and shot completely in the dark. <br /> <br /> The movie includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
