Will they ever make movies without nakedness and sex? It arrived at 3:00 on Sunday morning and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thanks, my son was out or I would be freaked out if he saw the soft / medium porn! Don't make people who make movies don't mind who they are offending or corrupting? Children could have looked at the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The acting was good and I enjoyed the tension, but GIVE! There were violence and bad guys, but it is expected in a Western movie. Randy Travis was really good at his role. If the writers, directors and producers just stop making so much unexplained for sex scenes. What has to happen to stop them from going in that direction? Where can I complain?
