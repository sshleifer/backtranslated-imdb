No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie were married, it was because they both thought they would help their film career. If you were through the ordeal to look, "Dangerous," then you know at that level it was a game made in hell. After about 20 years of a respected actress (or "octress" as she pronounced it in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can't leave her for a performance that someone with Taste can even properly name. And this is the thing that keeps people so much on her screen: her ego seems to be blown up so that she can't let go and commit to her audience. If there is any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.
