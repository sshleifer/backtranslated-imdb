This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that come to me right away: 1. The bushes were more like hills in Los Angeles with some trees and brushes. Not scary at all. News flash, if you are filming in the Southern California area, the big bear is just an hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. The writing was absolutely the worst dialogue I've ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was original, clich√©, or just stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (lamb), the clown's name is "the killer clown" (lamb). What does a clown do in a forest anyway? Was it the only mask they could get? 3. The last but certainly the least was the play. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever created. A virtual watch of rogue and poor acting. The worst part was over when it returned randomly to this fat foreign girl naked for a photo. It's a very long scene and I think she should be sexy, but she wasn't. Also, and it was one of the few nice parts of the movie for me, this tool was supposed to be "athletic". For example, if he is bored in the movie, he packs a few rocks and starts curling. Then he must run for the clown later and it is immediately clear with his "girl like" running, that he is quite far from athletic. Oh and the girl Kat played, good Lord, stop singing. The song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie for some reason, at least I would recommend watching the special features. The group of jackasses made by this film is talking about this original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says that she made her friends read the script and none of them could predict the end. Apparently she hangs out with special kids.
