Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name of the prime donna, Camilla, and the regular flowers that appear regularly, is enough to remind us of the sudden similarities between Dumas's novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille who envisions Garbo and Robert Taylor. but not least, Verdi's opera La Traviata. Beautiful, non-virtuous young ladies, social publishers for some reason, loved, split, reunited just in time to die the death of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal sites and stupid unrealistic dialogue the opera, but why dumps Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful version of LA in the 30's, an earthquake of deus ex machina that comfortably murdered the other woman and all the beauty on this mediocre turkey where there is not even a beautiful song is not?
