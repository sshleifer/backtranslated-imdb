Oddly, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth - not Buddy's Gorillas - emerging as the focal point of Buddy, a Jim Henson Pictures production by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face succeeded in the post-production phase, and she literally fills the screen so many times that poor monkeys are on stage. Inadvertently funny true story adapted from Gertrude Trudy Davies Lint's memoirs on a wealthy doctor's wife who turned their home into a menagerie for pets and wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it drowns positively with serious sincerity. The movie never flashes with the kind of "family movie" magic it needs, and before long people and animals also seem to be clearly programmed (nothing really feels). About ten minutes into, two chimpanzees go around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cumming's head by thumb); Yet, no eyebrows are raised, because it's all in a day's fun. Yet, when mature gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the policemen are called - and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while brushing the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's concerns in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But, at least we know Russo was in good hands: when director Caroline Thompson needs a good catch-up, she gives Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this photo? ** of ****
