Yes, I rated this movie as one star horrible. Still, it will be in my turn from Christmas movies. It's really that bad, it's good. This is another K.Gordon Murray production (read: Buy a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, spend zero money to translate it into English and put it out to kiddie matinees in the mid-1960s.) This is a pity that I'm so late in life, as I am sure, some "mood enhancers" will make it an even better experience. I'm not going to rehash what so many of the other judges have said, a Christmas movie featuring Merlin, the devil, mechanical excitement and some of the most pathetic children's acts I've ever seen. I plan on returning it over the holiday with Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". Really a holiday experience made in hell. Now that I can only find "All A Good Night (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I will have a triple feature that can't be beaten. You should see this movie. It moves so slowly that I defend you not to touch the fast forward button, especially on the two dance routines! This thing, like an expensive, bland cheese guess, must get past the stink to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
