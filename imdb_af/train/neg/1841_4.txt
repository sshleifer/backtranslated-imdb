It can be viewed in many different ways. This movie sucks, it's good or she's just strange. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and has just a strange plot. Whatever Christopher Walken would play, no matter how bad, average or even how good it could be. <br /> <br /> The acting was what you would expect from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always liked it, so you know what you'll get out of him, but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always out of the wall. He's always nice to see how bad the movie is. Comedy shows it's a little funny. Of course, this does mean that it does have its moments (but very little), but can get a little over there, which makes me feel that the movie is just desperate for the laugh, but of course not in a good way no. <br /> <br /> Directing was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overstated director and really hasn't done a good job here. This movie looked like it had much more potential and didn't do much to achieve it. Just very average and doesn't seem to be a lot of effort to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. This, of course, means the writing failed here. At best, it's below average. Considering it had its moments it wasn't too terrible. However, it's never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it's not for Christopher Walken and it's stupidly ridiculous, I would have given it a lower rating. He is always a character in his movies. Quietly, it's just an exuberant strange movie with strange characters that doesn't really go anywhere. Not terribly terrible, but I wouldn't really recommend it because it's a very forgotten movie.
