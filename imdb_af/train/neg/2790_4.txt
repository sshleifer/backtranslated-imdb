Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby son Alex to spend a few days with her family in Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple expect to solve their problems during the weekend in the remote island. While waiting on the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of mountain rangers live in the island. The reckless Peter smokes pot while driving the truck at night and relieving the headlight to dismiss; However, he accidentally walks over the young son of the Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son. The young family does not accept the trade, and they start a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low-budget movie, with a dull script, amateur cinematography, but surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is completely absurd, and there are many incredible situations. For example, how can two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road at night with the threats of the distorted family? The logical procedure will go straight to the continent and bring the police force to save Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car in the mainland and their home and friends, and no one is hunting them? Peter calls his sister Julia Alex when he arrives at the boat in the beginning. There are so many mistakes in this movie that I can write many lines on this subject. I believe this movie was filmed with a home video camera so terribly the images are. The good cast deserves a better work material. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Island of Blood")
