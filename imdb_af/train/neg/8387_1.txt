It was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a combination of recycled material. People who are hit in the head are not funny. People being kicked are not funny. After the third time a man kicked in the balls, and even the youngest member of the audience no longer laughed. It just got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She actually laughed aloud at King of the Hill, but this movie masterpiece bored her. I am not surprised. The story is pretty lame. A Midget thief steals a big diamond that was definitely the easiest in Hollywood history. Then he hides with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting, but it's the whole story. Speak the two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you'll get the picture. There were predictable jokes in general. I really felt after I saw it. I didn't expect much and I was still disappointed. I wish Keenan would only hire a few decent writers to write jokes and / or his next writing. It was even worse than White Chicks if possible. I saw high school games that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I don't like my entertainment being obscured.
