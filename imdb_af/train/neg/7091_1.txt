This movie was so amateurish that I could hardly believe what I saw. It's shot at VIDEO! NOT movie! I haven't seen it since the early 70's since the early 70's, when late-night networks shot the week's "horror flicks" in ... video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and it pays a compliment. Some of the actors give it their best shot. Michael Des Barres does well with what he is given to do, which should be out of control as a sex addict. I can't say it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for almost the entire movie, with very little variation in camera angles. I can't blame her for somebody else's poor blocking, but she's totally incredible in her role. Her little girl's voice works here against her. And I consider myself a Nastasia Kinski fan. She is definitely careless and exotic, but she is out of her range with it. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwhelmed. Every line she produces is with three exclamation points. Somebody had to direct her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres have sex with such a furious screw? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette as the sweet, malignant woman, comes from okay, and probably the most credible of the bunch. But it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst movie I've seen in years.
