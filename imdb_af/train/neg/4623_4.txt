If you haven't seen the Gong show TV series, you won't like this movie at all, not that the series makes it a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 5 out of 10 because some things make it fun to help clear up the obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) This is a funny snapshot of the era in which it was created, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a very funny cameos from people you've seen on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he is not on the air-TV personality. 4) You see many bizarre people doing all sorts of strange things just as you see on the TV show. <br /> <br /> I won't list all the bad things, because there are a lot of them, but here are some of the most prominent ones. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show Movie has lots of real TV shows that get tired of movie length. 2) The movie's story line outside the clip segments is very poor and basically consists of just one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually half way decent as an actor, but most of the actors are typical of the flatness of the 1970s. It's a great movie to watch when you don't see an hour and a half to see everything right away. Look 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But even then it is not so good either. ;)
