As a child I thought the weapon the killer was wearing was cool, but I was a kid and so I was a little stupid. Even as a dumb kid, though the movie plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer didn't use his lights to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a very solid role in it. What script they read when they were in this movie, as it is best boring and just a way to portray a light saber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is completely chaotic. The whole movie seems to turn around strangers and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and a few guys have a strange encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it was in the mix. Dead animals and so on to investigate and for some reason one man gets the weapon of the aliens and continues to use it to go on a very lethal spree. Seriously, just wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer, have good death tones, if you have strange encounters, show more than a strange light vortex thing, and if you have light sabers, call yourself star wars.
