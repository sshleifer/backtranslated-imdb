The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn in her little French cut bikini underpants and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women removing her slender little cotton tree while she giggles and dome. Ooooof! Her loins are in conflict with Nina Hartley's. This movie came out when I was fourteen and it almost shot me dead. I forgot all this in the naughty Roladex of my mind until I saw it the other day on TV, where they actually faded her mid-section into that scene, good sadness, and reminded me what a hottie of a woman, Goldie Hawn was in the 80's. Kurt Russell had a fun life.
