So far, I've completely forgotten about this movie. It was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonstrate a hobby I have ever seen. It seems the message is, "Do not use teenagers' imagination, they can take games seriously, get angry and hurt people." I can only guess that the spectacular authors of this piece thought that D&D styles are games of evil ritual or arcane worship.
