"Phantasm" of 1979 was a highly atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original Horror flick, and in one word, cult. The first successor of 1988 was greedy, witty, action-packed and highly entertaining. After the first successor, the "Phantasm" creator Don Coscarelly lacks, however, believes new ideas. Phantasm III - 1994's Lord of the Dead is definitely not a complete failure, it's even quite entertaining, but there's no more originality and the desperate effort to bring something new is sometimes tiring. disappointing compared to its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> Finally, we unravel the secret behind the mysterious sentinels spheres (the brain-flying flying silver balls). From there, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (like Tim, a small, a "Home Alone" style that is brilliant to shoot, a Rocky, a tough and super-cool nunchaku swinging black chick) is launched. The film also has its features - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed, guitar play Reggie. Angus Scrimm is rather tough like the Tall Man, but the fact that the Tall Man speaks much more in this movie, makes him lose his creepiness. The character of Mike is again played by A. Michael Baldwin (he was replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which I think doesn't make much difference. The gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but it is still a disappointment, especially as efforts to make up for the lack of ideas irritate very quickly. <br /> <br /> All that is considered is "Phantasm III" is an acceptable time warmer, but it is certainly disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two "Phantasm" movies can try it, but I do not recommend raising your expectations.
