Let's start with the simple lines. From the viewer's side, there are some good "director details", some points of view at the movie screens that are nice. The special effects are good enough, also a good play. But the story is too simple. It shows how an elite army bomb unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of life in the war. In my movie experience as a serious action movie "addict" man, I missed that click that fixed my eyes and mind on the screen. One of the things that should be in a movie to regard it as a good one is the ability to deepen the viewer in the film's reality and time. It didn't happen to me. I stayed "aware" for the whole movie. Quite frankly, I think this movie has gained its place in fame because of the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and true feeling, but not the adequate use as a film fame generator. More than a movie about war, it becomes its popularity based on it. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: if it was a World War II or a movie, just had changing time, with everything the same, would it be awarded? Certainly not. Why? Because there is a big one that raises the beam. <br /> <br /> Compared to its competitors in the Oscars, I don't think all the prizes they won have been correctly awarded.
