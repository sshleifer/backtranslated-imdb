Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really didn't get rid of my rent, and sometimes everything you could ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the movie is beautiful. The direction is acceptable, but the consequences are terrible, especially the werewolf effects, which are in a werewolf effect, a fairly big problem. There was a pretty decent amount of nudity, which is a good thing for me, but it wasn't that hot. All in all, it's a pretty average that is directly to video movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen and if you're bored with a genre fan, watch it one day. I'll even see it again. <br /> <br /> Bonus factor for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some of them) plays the werewolf.
