After watching this movie on the sci-fi channel, I can only conclude that this movie was made by a lot of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless series of bizarre incidents, or "delicacies" as the friend's reading about my shoulder tells me. The plot is not really worth commenting on, but basically a plane crashing into soccer players in the yeti territory. Before the movie is over, we are treated to eradicate the hearts, but it is still trying to run before they jump 50 meters. He tore off a man's legs and beat him with them, a woman who killed 30 meters with a spear, a daughter who survives a few more dots and is set on fire without any apparent damage, a daughter who deviates from a cliff by holding a man's shoe, but then jumping and a whole set of further bizarre incidents. Basically, if you don't stay on a Saturday for the obsessive purpose of watching the worst of the original sci-fi channel movies, avoid this movie like the plague. Or as my friend reads over my shoulder, says, "This is the best movie I've ever seen." Whereupon the friend on my right says: "Only techno-music could have made it better."
