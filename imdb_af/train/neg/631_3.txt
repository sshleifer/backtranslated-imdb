Amazing. This is what you want to say if you put through this movie. Simple, incredibly wonderful. It is so wonderful that someone was foolish enough to dump money to make this accident that you simply cannot believe what you see. This, my friends, is really scary for this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to make it. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazing original story: High School student (sometimes college, figure) has whore for a mother, lives in a trailer, and is an "artist" which is mocked because she "is everything else." Well, of course, this poor, ridiculous boy is eventually killed and here is the original part, his soul inhabiting a scarecrow (under which he is killed by his last girl's youngest John). Then he goes around with the standard death of all the people who did him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's the outline: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Wonderful funny movie? Though not what the clear drunk filmmakers wanted. <br /> <br /> - This and the successor to one disk in the Wal-Mart $ 5.00 bin ?? so it's just a little too expensive. <br /> <br /> Didn't do it, didn't help: <br /> <br /> - The violence and gore are kind of substandard. One person is stabbed with a wheat. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they struggle with music, but it doesn't really fit the movie? and is not so good. /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, horrible acting. <br /> <br /> - Another treasurer with sexy women? None of those who removed clothes. When did it stop being a pile of low-brows? <br /> <br /> - Tasty story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow vomits one-liners blushing Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger. <br /> <br /> - The underlying love story doesn't go anywhere, and is badly done. <br /> <br /> - Some of the people killed look like they're randomly chosen? You never really know who someone is and then they are killed. And you just assume they should come. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average food, just with a killer scarecrow instead of? Well, all the other crap. <br /> <br /> - Not as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series? this horror. <br /> <br /> - The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The script is loaded with a level of delay that I never thought could exist. I'm serious here? It's a step further than terrible. Don't get me wrong, it's funny like hell, but I've never heard of asinine banter, even in "Slumber Party Massacre III." This movie makes "Jason X" like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes the scarecrow: Worst wedge ever. Dialogue to update. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The one where primary school youths spell their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's go find tiny animals to torture. Huh huh." <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinema: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (None nudity, mother is a whore, girls wear no bras) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, moderate amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, blatant, over and painfully funny? so bad is it good . My first rating for dialogue in any movie!) Music: 5/10 direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> Overall: 3 / 10 <br /> <br /> Another person just like me who likes to watch pure shit. Or Slasher movie finalists. It's not a good movie at all. Laughable dialogue and characters keep it from really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
