I love Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her movies. When I saw Protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart, I bought it. Although it is almost amusing, the movie never really gets a step. Some scenes like a party tone in a bar only last too long and really have no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then of course there is the prank scene at the end of the movie that gives the whole thing a bad taste to me. I don't think this scene added to the movie. I don't like silly comedies trying to teach me to write a lesson, especially through a 60-year burnout. <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm happy to own another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!
