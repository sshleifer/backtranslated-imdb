This film played a good role: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - solid b-movie actors all. But this downer of a movie doesn't use any of them to any advantage. None of their characters even get together on the screen (although Christopher Lee can play him in various scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivation for the strangers in this movie seems to be changing the drop of a hat. First, they want to fix and leave their ship, then turn on the main character by murdering most of his friends and not abandoning his wife after he gets them the essential part they need. Then, this "peaceful" race determines that they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many diseases (though they offer the main character and his wife a place in their society). <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spent watching the man and woman ride or walk or stand or sit at tables that do nothing. You almost wish they came to the end of the planet with the rest of the planet, just in revenge for the death of us. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like Chris Lee or the seventies low-budget sci-fi, I'll give this one a miss. It falls into the narrow range of spill celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
