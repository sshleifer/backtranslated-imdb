which is an ominous story, blackmail, childbearing allegations, gays and the Catholic church ..... absolute trips. How is it that most British television dramas, sit coms, etc. should include the obligatory Gay, it really gets tired now. Everyone accepts that there are gay people in society, but there are other minorities, but we do not want it to fall into every throat in our throat (I'll surrender this one). Apart from the above, the drama went from what could have been an interesting story in a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there were gays running over each place, oh well, just to be completely. One of the gay couples was black. I'm surprised by c ecclestone even considering it when reading the script.
