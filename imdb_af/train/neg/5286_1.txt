I'm a big Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK. Just so I could see it without waiting for the US forever. I really had to save my money. What is Anne running to Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she is quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, does she suffer from a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal and her was not normal either. There was no chemistry between the two main characters who made their whole "romance" totally unbelievable. In the final scene they even included Sally Hawkins with the same dress that Amanda Root wore during the typing. The same clothes don't make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version, which, although it had errors, remains pretty close to the book. The book, I don't even think they read it. It's kind of like a Cliff's Notes movie of persuasion. Click on all the high points without explaining anything.
