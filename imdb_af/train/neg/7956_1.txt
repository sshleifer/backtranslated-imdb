This movie should be number one on the bottom 100. The acting is so terrible that when my son and I watched it, we almost got physically sick. And the story is worse. I can talk about how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was warn Frank's review, seeing that no one else was bothering to do it. Don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thanks, we saw it on TV, so we didn't spend anything on it. If we had, I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to delete an exorbitant general. In conclusion, I would like to say that I always enjoyed the Carrie Fisher act. But I'm sad to say she's not worth watching in this particular movie. Do not spoil your opinion of Carrie by viewing it.
