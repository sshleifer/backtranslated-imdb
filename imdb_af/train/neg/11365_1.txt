It's a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The writing is bad !!! I think they just copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers must have thought let's make a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now in the third week it's just about 22h45 in Antwerp and Brussels to do something. In the past, we had very good movies in Belgium, such as Daens. Shades are a waste of your time. Maybe you can sneak into the theater after watching a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of shades, you've seen it all. It is advertised on local radio and television. I hope it will soon disappear in the shades.
