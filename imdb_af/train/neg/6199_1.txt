First, a technical overview. The writing is so slow, it's really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "acting" is pathetic, they really lift school children from the class to read a few lines of an idiot board. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there's a shock!) Is really not existent. Without the 'shock' and the big publicity scene, nobody will talk about this movie. It's so bad, it actually makes me hard to think of the better things the money it uses could go on. Believe me I saw some bad "emperor's new clothes" movies, but the one thing I can tell them is at least they are well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two screens! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don't talk about them.
