Make your own mind. Personally, I got so much fun getting a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I just got it. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drink vendors, ordered the court to accompany two children from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man who plays a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny are desperately trying to make their charges invaluable in the light of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry white analogies. Support is: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
