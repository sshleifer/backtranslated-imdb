I don't know how this movie got so many positive reviews on this site! I am a big fan of the Vonnegut and am very familiar with the story of this Showtime original movie that has been surprised, but even if I wasn't, the poor observed, VERY poor casting (Sean Astin as the brilliant, athletic and whole individual, Harrison ?? The man's completely generic!) And substandard writing made these trips hardly visible. Someone pointed out how cute that Maculay Culkin line was. If you read it and thought it was pure comic brilliance (unfortunately it was probably the most intentional part of the movie), you might like this movie. But if you are a Vonnegut fan or not quite mad, don't see it. Please.
