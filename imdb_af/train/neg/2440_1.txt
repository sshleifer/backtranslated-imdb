Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties he also tried his hand at movies. But this incredible piece of junk has ended his stage once and for all. It also ended the scene of the Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who became a television presenter and programmer. I actually saw it in a (almost empty) theater because I was a fan of the group of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I regret that much money. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story, and it's done in every way possible. Some people think it's so bad, it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money.
