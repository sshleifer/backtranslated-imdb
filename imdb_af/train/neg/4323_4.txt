European vacation (aka National Lampoon's European vacation) is the worst of the holiday movies (the first and third one the best of the movies). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new role players in Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are getting a weaker script with a very bad dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not funny at all. To be more specific, the fact that the "jokes" are like they are just pasted into a paved composition, rather than serving a central plot, like the other 3 holiday films have. Oh yes, they can't win them all. 4 out of 10.
