After seeing some of HBO's good stuff - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say I have fairly high expectations before I watched the first episode of True Blood. Jeez. Often the writing seems to be written by an 8-year-old, some parts are just terribly filmed, (The scene in which she "saves" Bill, I mean come. She throws a chain at the old and ow! And it immediately makes him fever! It was rather embarrassing if you wanted my opinion, or a few moments before that scene, when she found out that the couple was with Bill, ridiculous, she heard they were planning their things and liked 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 of them are gone, and without any fight or noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I think the idea of ​​the show looks interesting, mysterious, intrigue, vampires that coexist with people our modern society ... but frankly I don't think they wanted to make more of this than a little soap show, that the average teen girl always looks, but no one else cares ... Unfortunately, the writing is poor, mediocre on It's best written, it's level and extremely predictable, often I thought it was a kind of joke or something. br /> <br /> Actors really deliver unconvincing actions if you want my opinion. They seem to be taking the show very lightly, as if it were a similar, low-budget family TV show (well, that's what it is, if you take the family part away). The only actor who seemed to me a little good was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, seeing the poorly written, extremely short answers he had to say, "What are you ..." "Can I call you a call? " , I think he did well to bring out the somewhat mysterious and frightening part of a vampire that anyone should have with a vampire roll. Anna Paquin was also good, but not anymore. But the old man already plays her brother, jeez, he's terrible. The scene in which he is arrested is just a disgrace to modern television. The acting is bad, the construction site looks like the bone, and the other two guys "Why is he arrested? Uh .. I don't know ..." It was pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing I totally missed was the way they offered Sookie's psychic powers. They let us hear what people think and both speak at the same time and it's just wrong. Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thoughts were an annoying radio channel and when they get close, they hit the right frequency level and have to hear everything they think. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are just plain unnecessary and that the vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I've written all these comments, because I thought the show was BAD, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality signs. I didn't think so. This is definitely not a good performance. Moderate at best.
