I saw an early performance of this movie in New York and I was very disappointed with my friends and almost the entire audience. The movie wasn't even that bad, it was good; It was as lifeless as a snake bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looks surprisingly tired of most of it and the snake effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those cute sci-fi movies, except that the film of this movie wasn't funny or even champion. It carried everything, flat and exaggerated. I'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was nicer. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it's a piece of it and plays with it, but what the movie fails to get started is a scarce scripture. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's joyful.
