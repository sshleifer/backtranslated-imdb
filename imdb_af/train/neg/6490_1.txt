Okay ... so I really saw strange / unusual movies in my day. Las Vegas fear and horror comes to mind when I think about it. Well, no more ... from here, when someone asks me, "hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I will say! And I don't mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the start of the movie, it was clear that it would be one of the trippy camera effects movies. By that, I mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, backwashing and moving people's words and scenes forward, with the color on the screen, flashing forward and flashing back constantly ... then you have the real act itself. People randomly become violent, shoot things / people, say the strangest things that just don't matter, if at all. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a writer who starts mixing real life with the book he is writing and for lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see this "journey" what he does throughout the movie. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar journey in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his journey was entertaining to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a very difficult time even completing Slipstream. It's a bit of my brain hurt. <br /> <br /> I can see a movie film that claims this movie with some cinematic nuances that not only make it unique but also adds to the sense of dementia. blah blah blah. The point is, this movie hurts your brain when you watch it .... it makes very little sense, it takes all your concentration to even try to understand what is going on and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about it being over ... and you can say you've actually put it through! So, if you want to see a movie, you will say aloud and in your head once and 30 minutes and both, and leave it for an hour and 30 minutes. <Br /> <br /> Mr. Hopkins, while welcoming you as an actor and commanding you to take a sting to guide .... please never make a movie like this again. Next time, try something that relies a little more on good storytelling than camera techniques that the viewer tends to leave with a headache.
