I'll say it again: this movie was completely paralyzed. Children will love it, certainly adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was basically a rehash of the original, which can be expected, as they had pretty much investigated the whole movie in the first movie, but had to completely repair the whole movie? I mean, everything is done again from the Little Mermaid. The worst part is Morgana "Ursula's crazy sister" who is out of nowhere and threatens Melody, who is ridiculous, since Triton is there with his magic. Why didn't Triton do anything about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I can go on, but I won't. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to catch more money from the Little Mermaid, and is apparently thrown together without a thought because they knew it would sell. Overall, it's a terrible waste of time.
