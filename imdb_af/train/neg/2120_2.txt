I saw myself as a bit of melancholy, especially when I watch a big touch and tear. But not for this one (which surprised me!) And it also surprised me to see how many people praised this movie so highly. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies: 1. In spite of debt, Ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find appalling that the film apparently has this type of suicide encourage. Some people may see it as a heroic act and some think it is cowardly. In the end, it was a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The movie storyline is over-dramatized, but the logic is over-simplified. Medical, blood type match is needed to be an organ donor. By the end of the film, we learned that Emily had the blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short periods of time. Yet it turned out that Ben had the rare blood type, the same as hair that allowed him to be her donor and convenient. Despite the scarcity of Ben's blood type, he could not only donate his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow, which in all cases not only compare the blood type, but also tissue antigens. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do the doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated despite the jellyfish he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I can over-analyze the whole story because it's just a movie. However, a few disturbing facts outlined above will help you reconsider your plan to see this movie. If you're going for a soap opera type movie, go for it. But it's going to be you looking for an intelligent entertainment, give this one a miss!
