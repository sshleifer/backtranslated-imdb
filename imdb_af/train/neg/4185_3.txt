I give this movie a 3, because it is worse than the culture films that make a decent profit. 2. Doesn't it make sense to you? Well, it doesn't have to. It's another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, leaving my phrase, incredible idiotic plot, where space-cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) battle a moron vampire space tour. <br /> <br /> Is it lighter than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her beautiful Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop stupid dumb in silly movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr Ironside of many movies, he performed at 164 in this movie! It's true that he was rarely in a big role, but still!
