No wonder historian Ian Kershaw, author of the pioneering Hitler biography, who was originally the scientific consultant for this TV movie, withheld him from it. Historically, the movie is just too wrong. The mistakes immediately begin when Hitler's father Alois dies at home, while he is actually dead in a bar. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in fact he actually moved to Munich after 1913. I could keep on endlessly. Hitler's childhood and youth are shortly suggested, making it difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important people from the early times of the party, such as Hitler's fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart or the party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, are completely missing. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script, of course, follows Hanfstaengl's own brilliance over the view of himself given in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-semite and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem of the movie is the portrayal of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly, does not have charisma or charm and orders everyone all around. After watching the film, one wonders how such a disgusting person could ever get any followers. Of course, since we all know what was a bad criminal Hitler, every writer is tempted to portray Hitler as completely disgusting and uncharismatic. But the fact is, he can be private, is very charming and entertaining. His comrades didn't follow him, because he was constantly shouting them, but because they liked this strange man. Apart from all the historical flaws, the film is well made, the actors are first class, the location shoots and the production design give a credible impression of the era.
