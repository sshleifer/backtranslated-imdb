I really love the sexy action and sci-fi movies of the sixties and this is because of the actress who appeared in them. They found that the sexiest women were in these movies and it didn't matter if they could act. (Remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed by this movie was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. The story here made a European science film called "Dragonfly" and the director was fired. So the producers decide to allow a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) to complete the photo. They are one truly beautiful woman in the movie Dragonfly plays, but she is scarce in it. Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses his fathers from his early days and puts it in writing. I wish the movie was a tribute to those early films. They can have many cameos by actors who have appeared in them. There is one actor in this movie who was popular from the sixties and his John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I should continue to wait for a director to make a good tribute to the films of the sixties. If anyone reads it, make it as sexy as you can! I'll wait!
