Why do all movies have such anemic titles over time? "An unexpected love" - ​​ooh, how challenging !! "So much I know" would have been better. The film is nothing special. True people do not really speak like these characters and the situations are really hacked. The straight woman "lesbian" lesbian looks more than lesbian. If you want to watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet way, you can enjoy it. Although it seems to have been written by someone who doesn't really come out of the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
