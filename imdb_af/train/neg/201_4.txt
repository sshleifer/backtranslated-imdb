Iberia is nice to watch on TV. But why do you see it in a silver screen? Lots of dancing and music. If you like classic music or modern dance, this can be your date movie. But another one and a half hours is just too long. If you want to see skilled dance in silver screen, it's better to see Hollywood movies. They know how to combine the breathtaking dance to a long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to dance from old experience. And sometimes it looks really good. But when the movie is one and an hour, it should be interesting at least most of the time. There are many kinds of art, not everything is bigger than life and this movie is not too big.
