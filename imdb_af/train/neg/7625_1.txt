This is your only heater warning. What a sad state of our movie as unprofessional junk like this is considered worthy of Oscar. <br /> <br /> I divide material into three levels. The first is the stage theater. Here the viewer is quiet and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and above all in the author's power. A good playwright is better than a good scriptwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better. The best playwrights know how to create images that cannot show the barren stage. <br /> <br /> The second level is movie. In this medium a weaker author can be used, but the viewer does not sit in one place all the time. With the film, the context can take on the characteristics of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing. In addition, film can manipulate one-day elements such as sound and color in ways that are almost surreal. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the writer, translated on paper and then reintroduced by the reader. Much more detail can go into a novel than it is possible for a film studio. <br /> <br /> Adjustments can therefore be made, but never down. Novelisations are never better than the base movie (see the dime-dozen at your local bookstore), while the movie cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can rarely be made in plays and plays can always be made in movies. <br /> <br /> As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails. It's a movie that has to stay on stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right. The characters speak the same and act the same, it is pure futility. Add to that a silly soundtrack and you have a completely incompatible movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians. The instructor was rushing about how sad the movie was. What is sad is how such stagnant work is regarded as depressed if the material itself is hilarious. If it was in color, the scenes of impotence, the pool party and the old hooker would be considered a great comedy. See what Lucas did with American Graffiti a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system should start learning OVER film rather than learning with WITH film. Two visually powerful downbeat movies: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, not that. This is the 'Last' I want to see. 1 out of 5.
