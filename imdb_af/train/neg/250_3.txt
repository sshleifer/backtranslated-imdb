Having seen three other versions of the same movie, I'm scared of me. It is by far the worst, mainly due to Scott's fairly dull and guided performance. His emotions throughout so mixing it makes it difficult to get involved in the movie. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at ease, you didn't get the sentence. Scott says the dialogue with many convictions and when he undergoes his metamorphosis is not convincing. I can't think of any actors in this movie that match that of the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) picks it up, gets better done. Very disappointing.
