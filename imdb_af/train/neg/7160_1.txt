Well, when the como look of Jason Miller (who erodes even more than he did in Exorcist IV) is the highlight of a picture, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It's a little bit of land, a little rock n'roll: mix two drunkards with money their child wore with a swamp all over the place (have you figured out that one yet - DRIED in a marsh?) In the basement, Christopher Walken works with a bad dye, and a girl who might have been an interesting character when they developed her. <br /> <br /> I understand - kind of - that they are going back to visit her family. Then. .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are several interesting flashbacks that I have to assume are that her mother is killed in a car bomb (I think). It is never linked to anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need for the grandmother? Now the grandmother can be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can make something of her. The best thing they can do is to have a tobacco habit. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They throw a right oblique character than the man. Is he naturally repelled (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he runs for her) or is he thrown at the type (he does have a good hairstyle and nice clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He is not a bad man. Not a good one. But disable. Why didn't they do anything to him? <br /> <br /> No problem: An old boyfriend appears. The man knocked him down. He came back to beat the man. (It gets pretty stupid, but at least THIS character has motivation.) NOW - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; He may just have married her for her money. The grandmother is locked up in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the witch's mummy (do you follow it?) What can come to life. In fact, you know she'll come to life, swell the music. A little girl lives in the house, takes tea to the grandmother (opens the door to do it) and gives grandma cigarettes. In time, Grandma came out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose the child at home and then lose their bedroom. Uncle got his throat cut in the basement. The front lady has nosebleed. The man drinks. They both drink. In view of this, the terrible truth mentioned in the first vote is an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all these dangling thread ingredients, no one could get a story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no graduation of light disturbance to terrible horror, only long slow scenes that go nowhere. And there is really caring - and they had places to deal with that aspect - the innocent child in the detention of drunks, The grandmother who can be locked up because she is a monster, but no, her worst mistake is to smoking. She has good hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no plot. Just a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library, with the rain coming in, and the soundtrack leads us. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Oh, beautiful scenery, good wardrobe. The cameraman at least knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor as well.
