As far as HEIST movies go, this one is pretty poor. Continuity is pretty common, there is not enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is wonderful, and he is one of the reasons it is worth looking at. Falk has some good lines, like "he'll be back soon, he's going to buy some saugages" or something ... there are some nice scenes, though they are entirely due to the actors' action . Direction, writing and editing are pretty common.
