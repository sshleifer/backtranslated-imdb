This movie had an IMDB score of 8.1, so I expected a lot from it. It starts out funny and engaging with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is halfway through, it starts to drag and everything becomes sickly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we learned to know them a little too well. they become caricatures, not real people. It's the same story I've seen hundreds of times, just here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I can still stomach a predictable love story if the dialogue wasn't so old! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and incredible motivation and unfortunately this was also the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will soon end in the Dead Movie Office.
