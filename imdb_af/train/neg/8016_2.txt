First, this movie is slow, and I see most viewers patience with it in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie's subject was one that I think would form the basis of an excellent movie; What is most lacking here was a plot that would promote the underlying themes. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because in the hands of a writer like (say) Lanford Wilson, I think symbolism like a mountain lion that enters a mountain lion school campus can enter into big, tragic relationships without having to deal with heavy hands. be. <br /> <br /> I think, with a good writing that supports the movie, the same movie maker, with the same taste and even with the same actors (who didn't really have a chance to impress me), a meaningful and poignant representation of the pain and struggle a boy experiences when he develops a powerful "beloved" on an older son he admires. However, I am sorry to say and armed without this foundation with a vague, dull and substantial uninteresting script without any kind of plot in sight and without any meaningful structure (for example, after I looked at it, I believe you will find that you cannot refer to climactic scenes, and rather, find yourself summarizing "Well, maybe the scene, or the one, was climax ..."). The result is 95 minutes of the tedium. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot we are never terribly interested in any of the characters; their tests and problems are simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, dramatic devices and surrealistic director's rights are astonished and confusing rather than story-related improvements. For example, I could never really believe in the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers will be completely amazed by the conventional way her phone calls are filmed. <br /> <br /> As the movie stands, I'm afraid this is one I don't recommend at all. What I can never understand is why a movie like this one is not recreated by an enterprising filmmaker. Instead of all the mediocre remakes of movies that were superlative in the first edition! All it needs is a good writing, written by good authors, and I think this movie can easily be turned into a memorable classic about an aspect of male age rarely dealt with in drama. All the elements that were so boring and appeared in the movie (the messages written on the boy's stomach, the Leah scenes, the TV screen fantasy) could get rich if it was based on a good STORYLINE. <br /> <br /> I see in a lot of comments that people are talking about this movie because it is somehow about a "gay" topic and I think it's wrong. Clearly, the "in love" is portrayed by an inquisitive boy on an older adolescent boy, but the character of Logan is too young to establish any specific sexual choices and in his portrayal of masturbation fantasies we see all sorts of stimuli , sexual and non-sexual, as we would expect in a very young boy like him. I believe that crushes such as Logan's are common among male youths who grow up to have a definite preference for female sex partners.
