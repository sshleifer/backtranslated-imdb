In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to look at.) But to me it's all there is. Most of the players seem to be running through the show. Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and does not wonder, people are running over Harry McAfee when it is played by George Wendt, who seems to be in a bar stool in Boston. . Jason Alexander is wise, but that wig has to go and I've seen better dance in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it is good to have a version of the stage now, but I hope the younger ones out there, who have never seen a musical, should NOT judge everyone about it.
