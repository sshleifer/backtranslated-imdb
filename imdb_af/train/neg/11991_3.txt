- Bad things: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake. I thought it was "The Twilight Zone". The flashbacks are pretty useless. One part of the movie he thinks his anger on a window will make his life better. I want to know the decisive director and if he was high because the acting, even of the adults, was horrible. A kiss scene in this movie even sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was wonderful. I do not recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good things: I don't know what I can really say. There are some tension parts you go but they are quickly shot by the bad stuntwork and acting. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: Don't look.
