Well, I'm bloody, a Woody Allen movie I walked out after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commentary on a movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you'll understand it why). In fact, it became very clear earlier that we would be complained of the screen with: a script depicting its appearance as if it were bullet points; a role that everyone was characters from Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and was badly aimed at doing so; and a beautiful camera, just that there is nothing to film, but to chat and the actor to do it. Drama? no; it is partially pre-told, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I went too early in this case, but by that time I had one-and-a-half hours of one-liner-Allen clones. The writing has its funny moments? I went almost completely in the background of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!) ?? But there is little pace to make them fly unashamedly, as is best. Worse than that there is no fluidity. Saying the wood of this movie, a forest looks like a jelly: the opening bidding discussion is the most appropriate case-in-point. The only thing that needs to be done by numbers is to review a pot. 10/02.
