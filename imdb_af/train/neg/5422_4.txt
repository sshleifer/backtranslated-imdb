What "Noise" fails to do is help us understand his character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer deal with the city's intrusive noises, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie, which has about as much creative credibility as "Death Wish". It's smart on points; especially a scene in which our hero tried to read Hail, "I'm too stupid to understand." He reads and reads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and didn't get it either. Just then a car alarm goes off. Throughout the film is constant interference of alarms and city sounds. Although it does not help to understand our hero, which allows it to destroy his marriage and be distracted by his plots instead of digging deeper into his person. <br /> <br /> Forget about filming its own sound problems, clumsy editing, and visible bombs. No, "Noise" is not bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end doesn't fall flat. Overall, it is driving home, a logistical point, which you probably haven't thought of. At least I didn't have one. Although it was ninety minutes long, it could not have ended earlier. The story dragged and looked like it was lost. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you might see at a movie festival, but will probably not be picked up for distribution. Watch it on DVD if you are really part of someone involved in the project. Otherwise, skip it.
