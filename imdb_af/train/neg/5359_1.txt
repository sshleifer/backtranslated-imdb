At a time when the constitution and principals of the United States of America were founded, it was delayed by a government. It is desperate to pay attention to its own internal problems, where the Geneva Convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty are discarded. Illegal actions that are far from the terrorists they oppose may seem appropriate. However, if you want to see a movie, Ed Zwick tries to defeat the SIEGE because NADA is one of the most infantile 'political' thrillers ever made. Like Robert Altman's FAT-A-PORT, the director adopted a topic, he seems completely ignorant and writes down his ignorance almost every frame. <br /> <br /> His terrorists are a very unconvincing group of stereotypes - Fabio Testi dresses as if he auditioned for MAD Magazine's Spy vs. Spy-strip, Michel Duchaussoy acts like an absurd KIDS IN THE HALL, who sustained sociology professor from hell, Mariangela Melato, a cardboard middle-class revolutionary wannabe. every convincing plot turns as if they want to be captured. The corrupt authorities are a bit better, but are still painted in incredibly broad draws. <br /> <br /> It is possible to make a clever movie about stupid people (cf. ELECTION), but it is a moronic movie about stupid people. made by people who think they are intellectuals talking to the masses. In truth, one was to recover Testi, Duchaussoy and Melato with Jim Varney, Johnny Knoxville and Shannon Tweed. The result would actually be to increase the film's intellectual content but not to lower it. <br /> <br /> Chabrol can only get away with his characters and events if he has taken it seriously, but his staging is so inactive (the battle scenes will embarrass a nursery class while shooting the kidnapping more is inept as the kidnapping itself) and its inability to throw it at least with some recognizable human behavior so blatantly that it is actually embarrassing to look. (Special mention should be made here of Duchaussoy: so very good in Chabrol's QUE LA BETE MERE, he is surprisingly bad here in a show that is so far above it is back again.) <br /> <br / > Chabrol has made fine movies, but you'll never guess this amateur mess. A newcomer to his work will never want to see another of his work. movies afterwards, which would be a great shame. Totally brave, and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material. One star out of ten - and it's very generous.
