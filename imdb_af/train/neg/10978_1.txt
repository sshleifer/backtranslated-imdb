Usually when a movie gets a voice from one, it's because someone simply doesn't like it and it's annoyed, it doesn't have a lower rating and decides to reduce it as much as they can instead of just give a low rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. It doesn't do anything right and it doesn't have the chance, because it doesn't really try to do anything. There are streets of a bad D&D novel kind of plot that doesn't coincide and a complete lack of any form of acting throughout. Obviously, no one involved in this project made a serious effort because even the hard work of stubborn undisputed persons would be more. A really horrible movie.
