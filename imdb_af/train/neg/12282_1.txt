It was one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. A college child has an epidemic of nightmares with roaming spirits at Alcatraz. Try to deliver a mix of Nightmare on Elm Street and a standard vampire ticket in the form of a bad 80's music video. This movie is washed down with a bad play and a very slow moving story. Although it is such a bad and often ridiculous movie (digging the mullets and the terrible dialogue), it would be good material to spoof for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't be fooled by the proud mention of the movie being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil plays a role in the film. It's a huge disaster, although one with a small cult follows (see the other IMDb comments for this movie).
