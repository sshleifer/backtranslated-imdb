A film from 1980's TV movies and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among others) in the story of a photographer dreaming to kill his models. Of course, the models and other people are starting to kill, causing all sorts of complications. <br /> <br /> Not a very good thriller is enough enough nudity and violence to get an R-rating, but not enough good material for any right interest. It is best described as the kind of film that Cinemax cable channel gave Skinamax's alternative name. I really can't see the point to see it unless you see every shaky thriller out there. (I also have to comment that this movie is filled with smoke, to the point that it becomes laughable when someone lifts)
