Despite his flaws, I enjoyed a "Cigarette Burns", John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story looked like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for the budget and time constraints given. However, with "Pro-Life", the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There are solid guidelines as always at Carpenter, but there is a quality of writing and the entire production itself that gives the feeling that it is made in a total and complete rabbit. The writing is not always clear, the message is vague and the story is full of plot holes as soon as you look back. Perhaps Carpenter wrote the script again, it could have been a valuable episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest pleasure. Certainly, the worst Carpenter has ever done. 10/02
