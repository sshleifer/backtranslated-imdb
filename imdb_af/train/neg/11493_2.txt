Störtebeker is really one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The play is unbearable and the historical background is mostly nonsense. Just two examples: Visby is shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a big city at this time, these are the best days already gone. Secondly, Hamburg would never be the city that would care for pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the largest town at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than everything: Directing! How can a dilettant like this man be allowed to direct such a film? Impossible! There wasn't a single credible scene, the battles were ridiculous and I couldn't laugh at most of the harsh scenes. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how a big television station can be so incompetent.
