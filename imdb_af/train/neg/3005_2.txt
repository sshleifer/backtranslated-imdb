Slaughter High is intrinsically your emblematic 80s bumper. A prank goes out of hand and lets a jerky man be terribly burned. A few years later, the cheeky man came back and started killing those who hurt him. Now the story can be intriguing and very entertaining, but it makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the 80's flashes that it has some humorous mistakes and continuation errors. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, but not as bad as one would suspect. Although it doesn't help every character in the movie is so much bigger and unlikely. The lead, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the easiest of all of them and she is probably supposed to share compassion and root. Nonetheless, the cheeky man is barely geeky and I think even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rude and just be straightforward about how geeky he is, so when he gets mauled, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There are many inadvertent lag potentials. Munro's lack of acting talent is very clear, placing her on the same level as the rest of the terrible throw. The entertainment, however, is easy if the film tries to put Munro, who is currently in her mid-30s, as a teenager among teenagers, badly. And then, when it comes to later life and Munro plays for her true age, the rest of the role doesn't play as adults. It's all going well with a theme song that is a hilarious effort of heavy metal scrap, accompanied by a human laugh and a screaming "I'll get you." Having said that, Slagthoog is not really a very good treasure trove, but it has a bad cheesy entertainment value for it. Perhaps it is essential for hardcore slasher fans, but don't expect any dilemma, tension or credibility. Awful !!!
