I still don't know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This "movie" was not worth burning the Memorex DVD-R; I thought I watched the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' video camera. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I really want to sue Aaron Yamasato from the bottom of my heart for the two hours he'd stolen from my life. So, it's obviously bad with that purpose; However, if you have to end up in hell and be forced to see this 90 minute doo-doo, you'll see that Yamasato is really trying to make a great movie. The actors try dramatic kicking performance comparable to Crimson Tide, but come closer to The Marine. <br /> <br /> The jaw is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are terrible. The story is at best a C-movie - the plot isn't even good enough to be considered a B-movie caliber. The dialogue aims to be dynamic and spiritual, but is like others. Rumors have it that a hard copy of the script actually flies. Plus, the techno score is annoying ... not because it is techno but because it's NOT STOP. That's right, the music plays on the background THE WHOLE TIME, which is a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what the indemnity claims, I do not buy it. BOTS was not deliberately so bad, because it took itself too seriously for what it was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was very low budget. But this is no excuse for his record-setting sucking factor. Big movies are born from the content, not the budget. BOTS also did not allow. <br /> <br /> Allow me to articulate the overwhelming power of this 90 minute waste of time: if I had a three-way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and blood of the Samurai came, I'd be quicker there than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, some people will try to defend the movie. Two, maybe three. They'll say, "It's grindhouse chop-socky!" or "cheesy in a good way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" Those people are idiots. A movie is good, or it's bad. There is no such thing as a good bad movie. But there are such things as idiots who love crappy movies. Do not misunderstand me; There are lots of dots, not-to-be-taken-serious movies out there that are fun and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS are not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover, so the next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD box, you'll have to see it. Don't look at it, just look - and silently go away.
