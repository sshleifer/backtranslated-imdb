The problem with this movie is a lot, but I will try to name the most beautiful and the most difficult one. In the first place, while the theme shows a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual, in movies and TV was something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or non-existent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, dialline and extruded emotion was absolutely and completely false. It finally reached a point after an hour of so many sensible rubbish that I walked out (something that wasn't unusual for me in the past year.) film study programs are aimed, but I believe the (formerly Amelia talented) director Mira Nair participated in this disgusting travesty. Perhaps the director talent in the US was pushed into the cesspool.
