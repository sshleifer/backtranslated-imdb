He pulled out the guys and guts his butt! This is a spoof right? No one really writes that it just happened that improv went awfully wrong. I think anyway. This movie should be a spoof, because who would say they wrote the script differently. Can anyone suggest that the whole hostage sit down while the director and writers go over the storyboard. <br /> <br /> Director says: "Next, our intruder villain uses his 24-inch machine to evade our spectator's neighbor. Going out of his bunghole goes" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant ! "the whole film declared. <br /> <br /> No way can this happen, nobody writes it stupid! Must be a spoof. <br /> <br /> I had the part where the skinny introspective beating beats, with the cast iron pit she gets on the cave floor. I was not sure the mint cannibal types bothered to cook much. Perhaps this explains why the cookie was lying on the floor at the right time to kill the deformed hull. Ironically seems that after the freaky man spent artificial expert spending porn queens and some of doors like jocks, he fell so easily to the frying pan of a slim, defenseless girl next door. <br /> <br /> How much is Richard Greco's guy doing in this? Did he fire his agent or anything? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the end to me because I didn't get it either? I can't really figure out why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who made her tea. Never, I don't want to know.
