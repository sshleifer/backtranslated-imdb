Nothing positive to say. Creeping nonsense, huffing and puffing with a "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (Cuckoo occurs), but many have the bouquet cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a "dozor" type of emptiness. It will be terrible if it is not the saving grace of utterly unattractive direction and incompetent editing that is sometimes so terrible that it distracts from the impotence of the actors. Special award to the cameraman to make sure each shot is unsteady (would anyone realize that Blair Witch had his 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) And pay attention to deficit-before-teens falling on CounterStrike and masturbation. The female head seems and tries too often seductively, male antihero needs a thickness trainer (although genetics are not bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. Anyone who judges it positively is a (far) cousin of the "authors".
