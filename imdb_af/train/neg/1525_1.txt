I watched it on a weekend afternoon as there was nothing else, it would have been more entertaining to chew my feet and probably less painfully. I urge everyone to just see it to see how frightening a movie can be, it's certainly deliberate. I clipped at every useless attempt at humor performed in such a childish, uncontrolled, bad way that it was out of faith. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, I think exaggerate? Well, give it airtime and think again. Terrible, totally scary. If it wasn't a prank, the director and anyone else responsible for it should be removed and quickly shot after being forced to watch this movie again.
