I just watched this terrible thing on TV. Needless to say this is one of those movies you just watch to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I don't know how much lower the bar can go. <br /> <br /> The characters consist of one lame stereo type to another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say the FIRST. <br /> <br /> I saw some flavored turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to mention any of them as it is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way, I watched the Vanilla Ice movie because it was so bad it was funny. This ... this ... isn't even that good.
