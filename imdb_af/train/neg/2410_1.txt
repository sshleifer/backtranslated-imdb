The hood of the living dead and all the other movies directed by these guys seem to have come together and filmed it with their friends who have zero talent for one afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely uncontrolled and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home videos are better than this movie (although the similarities between them justify the comparison). "Hey, see if anyone is stupid to buy our movies!". Hopefully no one else was. My apology to those involved in the movie, as this review is a bit hard, but I was the baptism that read your false reviews and bought the movie.
