As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and also gore, I thought Nekeddo bur√¢ddo sounds pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some pictures to make sure it looked like a good, greedy and scary movie to watch before being downloaded. So excited that it was finished and ready to be scared and in horror to recover from the incredible gore. I expected I was very disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much inexplicable, the gore was hilarious, rather than horrible, and what was with the cartoon style sound effects? The acting was probably the only thing that was scarce about it. I did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea into a shimmering light, they both left quite inexplicably, or perhaps I missed it because my mind could not understand What I actually see. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibalism and own mom kiss?) Certainly, I just think they have gone a little far and not even in a horrible way, it made it unquestionable which made it more credible to rather a comedy. as an abomination in my opinion. However, it is a very entertaining movie and laughed a lot from me and a few friends, but unfortunately we didn't expect horror to be comedy, so it is a watch for the entertainment value, but don't expect a dark, deep scary and horrible film; You will just be disappointed. If it were a horror comedy / show, I'd probably be about nine of the one. The climax was the strange scene when the man climbed into his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but at least I gave it an abomination.
