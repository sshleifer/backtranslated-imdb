Yes, it was pure incredible condescending chatter. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of ​​the US, it is puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have ample opportunity to reflect on these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the middle-west town depicted in this movie was true. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years ago that his penis is too big? Where in the world will you find it? A joke box in a pub that only plays vintage bluegras? A city with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no big gas station, no Tvs in the house, no McDonalds, no kids ... A people who know each other's intimate details carelessly becomes one big family who hate each other. The adult men plant female cushions at the local cafe, have farms, but do not harvest, kill the man they do not like before and look away with them, and everyone with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who is going to scorch the 17-year-old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too many fleshman to fetch in the maize trees by simply breathing an Illinois breeze to help bleed the same 17-year-old farmer. Help! I am so surprised and amazed at the absurdity of this movie that I do not clearly express how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer over what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I didn't destroy it for you!
