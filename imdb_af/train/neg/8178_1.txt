Have you ever watched a movie when 20 or 30 minutes are over and suddenly you realize you've seen the movie before? This happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is very misleading. I will swear that the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm either born a decade to appreciate the finer points of this movie or ... it's just senseless mess. I'm heavily leaning to the latter, but I think some out there have been linked to this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. A plot. Let's see ... there must be a plot somewhere here. No, I can't find it. It's about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and talking in a language that has become outdated decades ago. One of the female students loved her teacher. The teacher has a zealous wife (who he actually calls as an iceberg), so he is receptive to the girl's progress. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of driving and in dialogue and lots of spastic dance. Our cat, BooBoo, was transferred by the dancing high school children. She watched with incredible intensity as the dancers shook and danced on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 10/01
