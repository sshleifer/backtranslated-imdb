I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still boasts me to this day. I was fully aware of how terribly it was supposed to go, so I just owe it. But like most, I didn't believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan was just unthinkable. One of his movies can really be that bad. I thought it's just Sandler-haters. I couldn't be wrong anymore. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that doesn't have a funny one second. It's actually quite a goal. You might think in a 90-minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something that was even almost amusing. But no, it's just terrible. It's not that bad, it's good. It's just bad. You can't laugh at how bad it is, you can just cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you, but they never come. <br /> <br /> Did you see the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie were on the video box, people would immediately die with their own hand and there would be a smile on their face as they realized their sadness had ended. This will be the first smile since they printed the play. <Br /> <br /> You may just like to see it to see how bad it is, not to curb your curiosity. Don't do it. Please do not. Trust me, I do you a favor. There are 2 kinds of people in the world, those who think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those who haven't seen it yet.
