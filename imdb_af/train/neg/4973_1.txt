I stopped for five minutes when Beowulf received a double shot, automatic crossbow with sights for it. Not only did crossbows not have telescope images, but Beowulf hit Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The horrible woodworking and eternal darkness that bothered all Sci-Fi original films also didn't help. I only got a few minutes in the house before I got up my gall and decided to look at Lucy reruns. I'm really about everything I have to say. But, you just realize it's a TV for the TV and hit it all over there. <br /> <br /> A Travesty.
