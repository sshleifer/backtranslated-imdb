I watched the movie and was amazed to say that the movie could not communicate with me as an audience. The language will be ashamed of the street rolls. <br /> <br /> The plot; a father who does not force his son to marry seems far-fetched. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her big child to renovate an enemy will only attract attention. <br /> <br /> ... and I waited the whole movie for a laugh and laughed at my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth the first look . <br /> <br /> Hope this saves you time!
