Hollywood's attempt to change Jack London's life into a Jack London adventure movie is not a bad idea; He certainly led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. However, this movie becomes flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it doesn't have integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some Londonesque speeches; And it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive the "Call of the Wild" after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog, Buck. Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very nice. The film draws unlucky "Yellow Peril" parallels between London's life and World War II, which are both tense and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
