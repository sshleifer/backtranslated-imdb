After just looking at five eyes, I have to be honest. I just didn't like it. I read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just didn't get where these reviews came from. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for newcomers to filmmaking, and I have "I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the biggest problem. There were two cameras in the whole movie (which was OK), but they looked like very cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you shout all these girls and scream everyone at the same time, everyone is talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they say. <br /> <br /> It has a good idea to do this, in a nutshell they hit a parked car and then drove off, shortly thereafter they were driven by the car they hit. by a crazy woman who wants to kill them and has many chances. to do it! ... and on the other hand, the girls have a lot of chances to escape, but not! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just scraped through this one!
