After I got the performance of Mr. Have entertained Brosnan as a cadet in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I judge 10/10 about the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, tempo, music, emotional impact, etc.) I enthusiastically made this movie expected. I was very disappointed. It is a script that is not a movie, vulgar for the sake of vulgar, bankruptcy in every way that "Panama's tailor" is rich and satisfying. Infringes it on screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part;" it never came. I also didn't laugh or cry, though one dialogue made me smile. Value $ 7? Rare.
