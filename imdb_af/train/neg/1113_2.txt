Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and not called Topper? Go figure! <br /> <br /> This travesty is a great injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young versus old, blonde-haired versus hairy and kills people against shooting the gun out of their hands. Will the right Hopalong please rise! <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever made, and believe it or not, by the person we brought the Grandpa saga!
