Because I loved the original "Caligula", even with all its flaws, I have to say this remake trailer was uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Listen to Jovovich saying in the lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." I feel sick. The set doesn't look Roman at all ... it looks like a rich actor's Hollywood mansion backyard, and Roman costumes look like cheap bought at a suburban costume shop. <br /> <br /> The "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Spanish woman who was totally afraid of her, as if she didn't know it was a movie car. <br /> <br /> The play must be the worst I've ever seen, with most of the lines I hear random actors shouting "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" so loud and extremely annoying as they can. <br /> <br /> The random sex scene also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer and the scenes with striking actors / actresses such as Gerard Butler (who knew the screen shadows for all three and a half seconds), anything but to look uncomfortable or to go out with the minimal lines just to drag it with the ridicule of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's part consists of her body like her usual dumpy crack whore leaned against a door mumbled over the moon or something. You can't tell, because she's drunk or tall or just idiotic. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... random and laughing and screaming in such a way that annoys you. <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was in the original, and her return to "Caligula" consisted of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I especially like "love" (and with love, I mean hate) Ennia's line, "Caligola ... j00, I'm not something incoherent * .... * something that sounds like yonal *." It is also insanely arrogant that Caligula's four-year reign was greater than Jesus' birth and death. First of all, it must be the worst, most exploitative, self-sufficient arrogant piece of shit that is considered "art" I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he didn't have to know his name about this junk, no matter how much they paid (unless it was a billion trillion yen). The worst trailer ever.
