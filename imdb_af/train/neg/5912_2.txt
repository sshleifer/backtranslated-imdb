Having enjoyed previous work by Mike Myers (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations of a 60s bundle ghost were pretty high. After the first minute, it became clear that it was an exercise to be as childless and unfriendly as possible. I switch off after ten minutes. I've been watching it these days to see if I was unfair for the first time. I switched it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve-year-old boy could find this funny. The dialogue is embarrassing, Myers is painful to watch (like Heather Graham) and the success of characters like Fat Bastard makes matters worse. Apart from the almost amusing title and the psychedelic set design, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally advise you to avoid it like the pest, though several friends enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at that time). ยบ
