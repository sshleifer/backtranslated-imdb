This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with short periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is that anyway? <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big Ramones fan, don't and I repeat. Don't waste your time as I did. It's completely incompatible from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone looks like them in this movie. There is no plot found in this movie. As far as teenage comedies go, you scrape the bottom of the barrel with this one.
