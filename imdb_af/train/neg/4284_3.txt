Jason Lee's pips are back! If that's what you're looking for, look no further. If not, go better ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s galore, some poorly shot, but kinda exotic fight scenes (use JKD) and many bad acting and inexpensive effects. Poor Lee seems to have pain in the whole pain, and no wonder. Not a pleasant return. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't even cut it as a B-movie - sure, there was a German pale blonde Rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no free sex scene or even a single booty shoe. None. Zip. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudge scenes (as for the rest of my commentary on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence, please refer to our upcoming review on the exciting sequel ...). I got the feeling that the author is taking revenge on this - so I won't be in the "plot" of the movie, or almost nothing else. Apart from having some non-heterosexual overtones, it said. <br /> <br /> But this movie has one thing to do - no Jean-Claude :)
