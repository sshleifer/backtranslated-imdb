Until now, Gentle Rain was the movie I found the worst in history. It was replaced by this blockbuster from Asia. It has a "star" and that is John Rhys Davies. He is completely out of shape to be the swashbuckling, magical flying badge he is thrown here. The rest of these people could not play from a junior high school. There are no clicks missed in the dialogue, and the special effects are so often tuned in. <br /> <br /> It is pretty easy to see that someone in Asia had a few bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors. they wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or writer who needed a credit. My guess is that any career with this movie is in his beliefs. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a big favor and don't look at this movie. A hundred thanksgiving couldn't consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> That funny scene was unintentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. The king? A clean, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) The brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for that. They expected us not to notice that this poor man's Jet Li's brother was a Wannabe Pierce Brosnan, in a cheap dimestore "Injun" wig right out of an old Western movie from the forties.
