This movie is flash and no soul. The actors put a lot of passion in the numbers, but these numbers often didn't relate to the movie and felt like single music videos. And there was no attempt to make the numbers sound like they were going there before you, everybody sounds like it comes from a studio, which sucks the whole life out of the songs. From the stage, the performances were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who basically played the same fierce, "strong" (female and selfish) black woman we had seen before. There was absolutely no depth of her character, nor any of the other women. Although I think the film wants us to believe that Hudson's character is suffering from her weight, it really is her own refusal to do what is best for the team that finds her in trouble, making the end of the movie meaningless make. Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she exercised emotion (though often misplaced, but it was the author / director's fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with a bow, and he did a good job, but still not worthy of Oscar. The only actor who really made a difference was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something really out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth, no drama or heart, or even laugh. The placement of the music numbers was so bad that the film looked almost temporary of musical instruments, rather than being one; The number when Hudson fights with the other girls is as long windy as it was longer, it can be passed for a Family Guy shit. The film has no idea what it's about, and I've been insulting for the past few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and really is the worst movie I saw in '06, and nothing last year was actually sterile to start with.
