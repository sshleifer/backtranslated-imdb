"True" story of a late monster that appears when a US industrial plant starts polluting the water. Amusing, but not really good, monster movie has many people trying to get the monster out and find out what's going on, but not quite with it. Give it points to give us a giant monster that they have clearly built to scale for some scenes, but take a bit away because it looks like a non-threatening puppy. An entertaining exploitation competition that is nice and foolish in the right mood. (My one complaint is that the pressure used on the Elvira edition is so poor that it looks like a well-behaved videotape that was over its first 20 years ago.)
