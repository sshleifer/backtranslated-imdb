I was a fiery Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short "Survive Desire" in high school, and even then, he was still completely unaffected by his terrifying brilliant Henry Fool. But this 10-year-old prosecution is not just unnecessary, it's shameful. After a bumpy and quick start, Fay Grim decays into pseudo-intellectualism, flat boredom and ultimately unjustified - and unwanted - nihilism. And that's just the plot. <br /> <br /> The majority of the new faces are so cumbersome and poorly developed as the movie: one particularly flat character ends half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself, and that's his only spoken scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's agent Fulbright, it seems, is the only shining character (a word also meant by Hartley). So how's he gone? ** SPOILER ** Dead by a car bomb, which made the hearty Hartley's most violent movie to date, and it is all in all wrong in a movie that's already out of the word. <br /> <br /> If For the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to talk to herself. Well, I won't spoil their fate, because the movie does it well enough. own (if he doesn't handle another divine margin, giving the disturbing impression that Hartley is moving back from author to crappy film student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not even good-natured enough to arouse in its moods. Instead, the typical fun hipster pretensions of his director are placed in the "real world", one uglier and more sensible than it is needed, but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to saying something. In doing so, Hartley tracks my entire memories of these people and the wonderful world he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I'm rarely so depressed at the movie, and I'm counting "Las Vegas leaving," which at least has developed new characters that have grown before they destroyed them, rather than instantly typing characters already loved, ignored. <br /> <br /> Grim, indeed.
