I'm glad some people liked this, but I hated this movie. It had a very good idea for a story line, but that's where it ended. It was poorly written, poorly acted and bad. <br /> <br /> It had interesting plot points, but they were just skipped too fast, the authors needed to realize what to do and expand on these bits, such as lying about why she was kidnapping is to scrap the villain. Instead, it was "what's going on?" 5 seconds later they tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie had no tension, and I was bored from start to finish. I just wanted it to be done. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misery, or best plans, if you want tension or twists that will end up guessing.
