The movie lacks style, I mean original style. everything looks copied, including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialup etc. Yes, there were the goof-ups originally, as in the beginning a car with number UP **** number is shown and a few seconds later it starts with a hill with the number MH ****. It was one of the many goof-ups of the movie :) Anything good in the movie? Yes, for Kareena fans, if any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, its dialogues and action stunts. That's it. nothing else. So watch it at your own risk and don't blame the director or actors. Director is already mad and actors, I'm sorry for them.
