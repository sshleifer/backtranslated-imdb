Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of themselves. This Fantasy was modeled on the series "Walking with Dinosuars". Although it is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even the fantasy dragons mix with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. Adding to being shown on an educational channel, rather than saying Sci-Fi, gives it a sense of genuine authenticity to this show. <br /> <br /> On its own, the show is going over a 7.5 / 10 way beyond entertainment. But the way it is offered, I have to give a 1/10. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with fantasy, but the way they print it is so wrong. I can really see young children and slow adults believe they have found a dragon and that it really is. <br /> <br /> I also think it weakens the great "Walking with Dinosuars" series, because now you have to see it with a thought of how much fantasy is on that mini-series.
