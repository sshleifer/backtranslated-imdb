I love a good war movie and I fall into the "there is, ready that" category. So I'd like to think my review is an accurate one (IMHO). After watching this movie just on DVD, I can safely say it was a lot of waste. There is no way I can recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br /> It started with me screaming on the TV and saying "you won't do it" etc. But I soon realized that a bit of work experience would be a hindrance, so I cooled down a little. But at the opening scene when the trailer fell, I felt a nasty feeling that this movie would be a predictable dud. I'm right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic to the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team of the most patient rebels ever had on the other side of the command line or remote trigger. So much, I've been scratching my head all the time. Then, just when you think you know where the story goes, the guys in the Humvee are out of their own around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater is on a solid clash in some SAS wannabe contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just as lazy. It didn't make sense at all and made me switch off there and then. Then they threatened me for so long to drag it out for so long. It tested my patience very well. It started with the "Contact Right" and went down quickly. If you had a British accent, you shot, but if you were part of the EOD team, you were suddenly a good shot and you saved that day. Then, just as you thought it was over, it stretched for an inexplicably long time without adding anything to the story. You just left and see why it hasn't ended yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had the drink scene where they just beat each other for a laugh. Another scene where you just wanted it to end. It didn't add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> When my life was very boring, the chief star went out of the way to hunt someone. It's the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. It denied all the logic and ability to write a good story. It was senseless and terrible. I still don't understand why they spent time on it. When I looked at him, just through the busy streets on the way to the camp, I walked on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this storyline is about the show, without really deciding what it wants. I thought it would be inaccurate illogical EOD scenes, but then it remains at interfaces trying to be something else. But as hard as it tried, I just got bored. All I wanted was to end. It was a messy compilation of silly scenes mixed in a bundle of silly, senseless, action (ah) scenes. <br /> <br /> There is no way I can recommend it. Perhaps my work experience has jeopardized the genotype, but even the naive must realize that it just doesn't make sense. The only thing more stupid than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be the 24/7 work of the PR team of the box office, which looks like this way of letting everyone think it is good. Sorry people ... it's just not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it will just drill you.
