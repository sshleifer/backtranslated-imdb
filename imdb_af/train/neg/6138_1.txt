This movie was God-fearing, from conception to execution. The US needs to set up a Star Wars website in this remote country? This is their point of departure? The way to access is to join the US is to win an obstacle course like a land race, where the leader of the leader can ask. And who better to win this race, known as the "game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this purpose. And don't forget his dad was an operation. Fortunately for our hero, there are gymnastic equipment in happy places, such as the rocker horse in the middle of a square (without reason) amid a crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But, besides the horrible, HORIBBLE premise, the awkward fumblings of romantic scenes, the naturally highly depressing ninjas whose only work seems to hold a flag to show off the road, and the worst highlight ever. After winning the race, our hero sets out the wishes of the US government. And look, all the trouble was worth it, because the US gets its Star Wars website! Huzzah! THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But still, such a bad movie, it can be great to watch. The cover alone, depicting ninjas with machine guns, was enough to help me rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if I ever met Kurt Thomas (the gymnast's star) in real life, I would probably kick him in the face of a double summer kick with 2 1/2 turns in the layout position.
