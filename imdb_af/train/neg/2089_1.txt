Of course I looked at BG. I loved S1, I had season 2 this year, season 3 was OK and loved the final. Yay, there's a spin-off show! I didn't know it at all, one of my friends told me about this. I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of garbage! Teenage girl drama festival. There is no science fiction ... well, almost any. At the end of each episode we can get a brilliance from a Cylon. That's all. Who cares? Did they decide that the next show's target audience would be women under 18? Drilling religious nonsense, groaning, bitching ... and more. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that nothing is there at the moment to look. Stargate destroyed, BG over ...
