This is exactly the type of movie that frustrates me the most. Great role, great director, great story potential, then it ruins everything with a script that goes nowhere ... and says nothing while you go there! There is no depth here. No depth characters, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, tension or common sense. We know what is happening, we are told how they intend to solve the problem, they fix the problem, make a surprise with us at the end that doesn't get stressed, then they stop the movie suddenly. Lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Glenn Ford leads a film by British (and one French) actors who are all fantastic and do an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they've been given. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", giving a wonderful piece of humor and warmth to a dark and serious movie. I also thought the movie had a good view ... all shadows and fog ... lots of movie noir in feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the actors do the best they can and are directing, it's nice, it's still not enough for me to recommend spending the time watching the movie. There are much better Glenn Ford movies there: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
