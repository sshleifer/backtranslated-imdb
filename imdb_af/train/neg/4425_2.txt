A film about the Harlem Renaissance and especially one author. It contrasts it with a contemporary story about a young, gay, black artist. <br /> <br /> If it sounds fuzzy, it's because the movie itself is. It was well directed, fairly well written and (mostly) well behaved. Also the screens in the past shot in cheerful black and white. Also this is one of the few movies that deal with gay men who are not shy of sex scenes (not explicit and no frontal). Yet I usually hated it. <br /> <br /> The film is all over the place, full of unlikely characters (including the main character) and (it is the killer) moving at a snail's pace. Three times I considered leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His talk afterwords show it was a labor of love and had 6 years to complete. I really wish I could find it more (there are a lot of movies that are honest with gay blacks), but I can't. Unless you are very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
