When I found out, there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder. I went through the roof! But I had a hard fall after watching this lamb film and I still have the effervescence. First of all the character Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment) was just awful. He treated his family as a crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I couldn't make any of the characters close or sympathetic and I'm not prudent, but the sex scene was really unnecessary or they could be tinted. Wynona and Antonio's characters could have developed much more and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what was Meryl's character and her "mystical powers"? Why didn't they go in here anymore? This movie has many dead spots and the bottom line is that it is a very bad movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.
