The show is average. That doesn't make me laugh. However, I think Courtney really dropped it. She doesn't look natural. She has these three ways to talk, all robot. She speaks quietly (without intonation), she usually speaks (without intonation), or she does the thing she normally speaks, and starts shouting. However, her scream is like "let's pretend I'm screaming because I'm not too hard on the set". <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware of herself that this cute actress is doing this funny thing. This is irritating. You can't really get her personality because she doesn't actually produce emotion and doesn't get upset. She has this man, who does all these stupid things, and there is no response from her. Very dry and plain-working.
