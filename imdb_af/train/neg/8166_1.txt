I searched for a copy of The Forest because I looked at a VH1 specialist. I think "Where are they now?" And the video box flashed over the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon. He played the masculine ghost in this horror B-horror, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television program. This movie is a great fall. There is nothing here. It actually took me four months to look from start to finish. I stopped it in boredom, put it aside and forgot about it, then stumbled and tried again. It was clear that the angle of this film intended to distinguish it from its peers was the supernatural element, the appearances. And of course, it doesn't work here. I can't lead the male lead. During the longer dialogue scenes, I expected them to look at their palms to read cheat lines. The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to camp separately is uncomfortable and simple. I think the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the man falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. It's pretty good make up there. Man, I really reach a positive, huh. The only other non-budget horror movie at a level as bad as this would be Home Sweet Home.
