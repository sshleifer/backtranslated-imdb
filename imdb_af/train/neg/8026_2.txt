It makes one wonder how this show is still on the air. There was one couple staying together, having married and having children, but all broke up. What is the point to continue? The show can be entertaining at first. You see all the girls sweating about one man, almost all of them immediately. It's just like in real life! The girls start making one side, tapping each other and showing their true self (or so we think). But that one man is left to decide who to choose what he thinks he can marry and stay happy. <br /> <br /> What is true love exactly? How can you fall for someone when you are forced to choose them? This show is incredible. You thought online online was bad, but people have to go on television to find love? It's not realistic. How can a girl be with a man when he comes out with several others and makes up with them? None of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there won't be a happy ending in the future. For everything we know, everything is written.
