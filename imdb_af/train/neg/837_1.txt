I saw the first two very much and enjoyed it a lot. Especially because the second is not just an attempt to make another one as good as the first. And it's a story that stands alone. You don't have to know the first movie. I also liked it in the "Free Willy" movies. <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both had the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is okay, there are funny parts in it right. But what? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is a tough effort to get even more fun from the first movie than it already has, and to tell the story from their point of view. But what? I really want to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two sitting in the theater, watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes next is usually unnecessary. I think many people like Timon and Pumba, and so do I. Still, for me many parts were built a lot with an effort to be funny. No chance, most of them were not funny at least, at least for me. VAT. how was the movie anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun from the first movie? I tend to choose option b, and I'm very disappointed with it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see stories like: "The story behind xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really funny and trying to get out of "Hamlet", then it has.
