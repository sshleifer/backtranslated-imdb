The CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most exaggerated, over, everything I've ever seen coming from France. There's nothing worse than a French production trying to make movies from Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror / action / girlfriend. I almost kept it halfway, because I knew it would mean nothing but the Frenchmen were trying to show. <br /> <br /> The movie starts to look promising, like a kind of vast horror movie, but it's fast moving genres, from horror to action to x-file type to friend, it's in the end, CR is all and nothing of it. It's so full of clich√©s that I thought at one point the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and the silent silence, with thins and disappearing just at the right moments, sounded me. I thought only Hollywood-made movies used this hackneyed technique. <br /> <br /> The chase, with Vincent Cassel walking to the killer, is so exaggerated and beyond that it is almost beauty. The climax on top of the mountain, with the silly revelation of the killer (s) with Cassel and Reno playing in 48 HRS "buddies" like Nolte and Murphy, has spent the full credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS doesn't even come to GOTHIKA, who has all of its problems, even near the horror of this overgrown, tangled movie.
