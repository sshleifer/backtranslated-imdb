When I was a kid, I remember that while visiting a friend of our Uncle Phil. We're back! A Dinosaur's story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur named Rex (pronounced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little boy dinosaur the story of how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live. He explained that he was part of the thing they brought back with some friends. The doctor / professor of this movie, I think, might be responsible for returning them, but I don't care. The kids might like this, but it's just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Weak!
