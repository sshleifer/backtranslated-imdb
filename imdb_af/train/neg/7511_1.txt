It was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I've seen in many years. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I'd try this one: bad mistake. The film is supposed to show how the Son of Sam influenced real life murders in the summer of 1977; What it really did was to deal with the most boring characters. I doubt anyone who cares about their drug problems, marital problems, and so on. The scenes depicting the murders are just that and nothing more; a shooting and then it's back to Saturday night's Fever! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to appear as a reporter in the movie: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, it's even worse. The most beautiful scene was the dog talking in a dumb voice, previously portrayed in a scene where it should have been? Spike, what did you think when you made this movie? I don't think at all, I'm guessing. People who think they'll see a crime drama, give me advice and don't waste your time or money on this loser. You're better off looking at Jerry Springer in this case! Waste of film, I gave it a 1 out of 10: terrible dud.
