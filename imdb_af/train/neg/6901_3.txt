The most positive thing I can say for this dull local lawyer production is that it is unintentional. In fact, it is so amazing that you wonder how many decades have been reviewed by the committee, so doing so to remove a complete removal of personality. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's not informative, and it's not charming. It's just an indifferent, lax, four-loser progression that needs to change - and their attitude toward women - to attend their best friend's wedding. <br /> <br /> With acting it would be under par for the local amateur dramatic society, a plot line so tired that it will look like a forty-third season of Allo Allo, and jokes are as humorous as vegetables to leave. However, Sione's Wedding scored ten (yes 10) nominations in the NZ film. awards recently. <br /> <br /> Luckily, someone saw and didn't win.
