Richard Pryor's early 80's who descended on the street on a fire incident had to somehow influence him. In getting up, he jokes about getting big laughs. It seemed as if the projects he had chosen had done. The Toys is about the lame he ever chose, except I think another. <br /> <br /> A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? A bit of the underlying political inaccuracy before you was something like that. It shows that Richard gets everything sentimental that makes me end before the end. I wanted to see Pryor even come up with this brat, but it gets the misunderstood kid's nauseum! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore it and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his 70's. It's a waste of any movieman's time!
