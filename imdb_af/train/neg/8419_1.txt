I've been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a while. What's with all the views, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really depicted the black music scene. But like the movie, I and my whole family were bored with our minds. The song just kept coming, one after another. I mean seriously, just another music number and it would have broken even with RENT. <br /> <br /> I didn't notice any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't mind what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters had a thin background about the song in their childhood and what wasn't, but there are no personalities known to sign me up. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not meaningful enough to care for the viewer, it coincides with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). In general, I think this movie suits anyone who doesn't really care about an overall story, but will enjoy two more hours of entertaining and fun singing.
