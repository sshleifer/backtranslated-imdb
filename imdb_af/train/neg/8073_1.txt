If the author / director reads this (and I think you are because you have to be out of work) then I have to tell you - I've seen bad movies in my time, but this one gets the distinction to have the worst point of view . I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (If the whole movie was in a coma, touch the scene she's with the old sleep, someone who raped her while she was knocked out?) <br /> < Full litter.
