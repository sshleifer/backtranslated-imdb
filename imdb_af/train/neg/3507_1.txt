A low point in human interaction has been achieved by the Maysles Brothers with this film. Remember, those who used words like "masterpiece" during the review of this movie, that these Maysles are crawling, have not just happened to drive to the Hamptons, and are filming some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people, they had to fund their project (and suggest what they had told the money to sell the project). Then they became friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of thoughts here or real consensual participation. These miserable Maysles smile, kiss ass, have done everything they needed to help the Beales work together and then exploit them as badly as ever. One would like to think that these hustlers sometimes had thoughts of repentance and guilt. But the movie-making process, given the pre-scheduling, actual shooting and then editing has plenty of time and their purpose has no provision for actually relating to the Beales as humans. An exploitation movie committed by the fierce people. As time went on, their film reputation was severely colored by what they did here. Their reputation as humans is impeccable. This is what people will remember them as. Grotesque hustlers.
