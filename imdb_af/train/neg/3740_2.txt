Suddenly, this movie was ridiculous. Not that it didn't solve issues? For example, the best aspect of this movie was the beautiful backdrop. Anyone who does not live on the East Coast should know that the South does not have beautiful mountains like those in the West. I knew it was Utah right from the bat, but Dalton couldn't suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse it by saying it was a southern town. It was easier to move its accent into a Southern one. Certainly, the movie has twists, but its fake sense of place was something I couldn't get past. It's not like Utah doesn't have laboratories ... so why the authors consider it necessary to pretend to be in the south is outside me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action photos, always mystery me. Why do they always make the sound effect when the character draws an automatic handgun? It seems that every other sound effect in this movie was a "chuk-chich" which meant that a 9mm was charged and ready to burn. Of course, the weapons have already come round, so it was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics WAY was at the top. But hey, this movie is aimed at a certain 'market segment'. I think it's too bad. Each of the actors can perform, but this film was lame.
