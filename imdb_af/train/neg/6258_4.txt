Author-director Tony Piccirillo has adapted his own plays over a straight man, recently widowed, in the last three weeks he has learned he is HIV positive; He follows the one homosexual partner he has ever had, bring him to an apartment and tie him in, forcing a blood test on the man and promising bloody revenge as the results return positively. Intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it spells. James Marsden's prisoner is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actor's own artificial ways are disturbing - it's like watching a road-show version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality turn from shy man to kidnapping on the edge is not convincing, nor the talks the two men have. Marsden's gay party boy is not apathetic, of course - he is instantly sympathetic to Speedman's fate - but he doesn't respond or acts like any homosexual man in those circumstances. The film is not an exchange, exactly, but it is a fraud, which is further hampered by the bad editing, the badly negative flashbacks, the low budget production and the big finals that hit bad pretense and soap opera melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
