The sitcom "The League of Gentlemen" follows the lives of several bizarre residents of the fictional town "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked together by their common environment. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show, the main track is a new road built by Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" shop, who are actually far from town, do not like foreigners. When a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when the couple absorbs two engineers who want to build the new path. Edward drums, while Tubbs is half naked about the victims dancing. <br /> <br /> Pauline also lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local work center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman doesn't want to lose her job. So when an unemployed man gets an interview as a fireman, she doesn't allow him to go because he's not ready for work yet. <br /> <br /> There is Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver Details on "her" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> Also, the veterinarian, Mr. Chinning, killing animals instead of healing them. In one case he comes to a farm and is led into the lounge, where a dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes outside. Assuming the dog is the sick animal, Mr. You know him. A second time, the farmer opens the door and holds the "real" sick animal, a sheep in his hand. <br /> <br /> Some residents are a man and his wife who is visited by their cousin friend is killed by the shop owners. The couple are very neat. For example, they have towels in different colors. Each color stands for one part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys, labeled with different colors and exactly classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. By playing women, the screens become comics. The costumes are also suitable for the actors. Tubbs wear a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have black teeth unpleasant. The show has very dark humor, typically British. The set design reflects the mood of the range. The town and all the houses look gray and are decaying. Around the local store there are often misses that reinforce the threatening effect. Even the village sign is ominous: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors do a good job, this type of series is not my taste.
