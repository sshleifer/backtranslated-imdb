Now, don't start calling my names like "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and more. <br /> <br /> The whole length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. No editing - looks like J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan was 4 hours long, but it was entertaining and also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It is based on true incidents and real people. Kudos about it, but were the recurring war styles really needed? In addition, the focus has constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep all of them. <br /> <br /> There were songs about loneliness, love and related things between screen shots. There were nice conversations. In the beginning, it gave some relief from the violence, but later became so monotonous that it even predicted the nature of the upcoming talk. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers run around as if they were lions in jungle, fully unaware that the enemy was somewhere near? And when they were shot, it raised sympathy, but it was impossible for them to be such a cock of their safety in the first place. <br /> <br /> Music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful, but didn't fit the movie. . Better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie. <br /> <br /> It was the saving grace: From seasoned veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relative newbies such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for alleviating the mood when needed. <br /> <br /> Dialogue ranged from brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with Love !!"). Illegal / monotonous ("Pakistan's zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And the explicit spree consisting of all the MCs, BCs, Cs and F words was not really needed. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil strives to give an appropriate tribute to the brave Indian soldiers, but tries too hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers definitely deserve a better tribute.
