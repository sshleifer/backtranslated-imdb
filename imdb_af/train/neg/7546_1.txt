I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would be on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to look at it at least once ... but trust me, this is. <br /> <br /> I didn't see the old movie. . But why would they want to try a movie like this? The very basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is whether it should be a very intelligent script or it should be very graphic. This movie does not fall under any of these and just stays silly. I just kept looking at the movie hoping it would be interesting at some point, but it never did. <br /> <br /> So this movie is a great no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You can probably appear on television for that.
