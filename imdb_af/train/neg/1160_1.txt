It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's (according to me) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, his tough but fair trainer, his girlfriend and fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who constantly has nerve crashes. The story goes nowhere, there is zero character development, no one cares, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson can direct such an awful movie. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
