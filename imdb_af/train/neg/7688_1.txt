Terrible movie made on a budget of about $ 9.99. Many clear thumbnails used, poor acting and a horrible storyline about aliens who are throwing away meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains a little blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an egg stroke that replaces one of his hands. (Yes, you read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> One saving grace was a song at the "talent show" (how is it irony?) Through a punk / new waveband I think, called a heat-seeking missile. "Unlike that, it's not worth your time, not even on a" so bad it's good "level. See if you're in cute alien movies, but anyone else should be clear <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
