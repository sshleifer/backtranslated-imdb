I am the man who usually likes opinions, but I just came back from this movie and felt I had to express my views. Let's start saying I'm a big horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I would like to see even a little bit of a good writing and character development. I know they often lacked in horror movies, but Prom Night didn't even seem to have tried in the department. Next, we all love tension. It's on the edge of your seat tension with unpredictable surprises. Yes, Prom Night had nothing of it! Of course, we like a frightening killer. Prom Night has this? No, it has a nice boy with a cute lilac knife. And if everything else fails ... at least, it's scary his guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like Gore Gore Gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well, if you have a horror movie, like PG-13, like Prom Night, they also leave those things out. So with all these elements missing, I ask .... is it still a horror movie? Nope. I call it more of a comedy. People in my theater laughed more here, then they were when I saw Semi-Pro who had to be a comedy (which also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I just have to get up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good oil days are again in garbage, so movie studios can make money. The people I was going to see didn't even know it was a remake! What makes me angry! I wonder what will happen if there are no more movies to recover? Where will the horror go next?
