Again the same famous story about a man (writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most desired ambition in life: success. Insecure writing (we need to "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" Christmanish message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and " a very long trial scene at the end where the agent Hopkins beat the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or angry at all) for all the bad things she has done to this unlikely character. Not bad actors' efforts (Baldwin, also as director, Cattrall in a "Sex and the City" role, Aykroyd, with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Also try a non-popular movie from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man gives his soul to the devil to get his youth back)
