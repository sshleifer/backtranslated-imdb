this movie really tries hard. If you are going to make a horror movie, give it at least a reason to believe the hooker. <br /> <br /> You wait and wait through the movie and wait for some great explanation, but that doesn't mean. Instead, it tries to be smart and not to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the movie? where does it actually go? and more importantly, the hell. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how do they tie in anything? just another poor scientific horror. I love the fake reviews on IMDb and say how good it is by related press releases to bump the movie (whether it be people have low horizons). It's not worth your 2hrs. <br /> <br /> I don't say the movie is better than the fragile one, but at least it has argued and why things happened and have an end result. It's not and it's just waffle up with tons of stuff to make everything scary. this movie is about as low as when a stranger calls. God who was also lame. <br /> <br /> Big point, if you make an abomination, make it credible with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook in your story. For if there is no reasoning or credibility, nothing is stuck and it cannot be scary. no lack of respect for the cast or crew because they did a good job. It's just the poor writing.
