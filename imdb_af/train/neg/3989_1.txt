Who plays in their right mind a lyrical song at the same time that portrays an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his wrong wife in the locker room, the song sung with lyrical content is as hard as the dialogue, so you can't hear, any emotional impact the scene may have. The screens of Annabella are beaten by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt was so beautiful to be absurd. This whole movie is a cartoon, the turbulent bias against whites is literally amazing. The conversation of the black women after the woman's finger finds out that he was cheating on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an Oxford team, it is ridiculous. The disastrous racism can possibly endure, but the soundtrack and the sound mix during this 'movie' is too much. It was a technically poorly crafted movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of filmmaking, the soundtrack, the editing and the desperate effort of great actors trying to keep this movie. I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn and wondered why he accepted a role in this movie. His appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I have seen by this director and it will be my last.
