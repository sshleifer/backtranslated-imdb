I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. Beautiful cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. I was hoping for a repeat of the hero, but it is much, much worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is why kung fu movies have a bad reputation in the first place. No credible characters (even in the cartoon-rich world of kungfu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and ridiculous story twists. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and frustrating as it reminds you of trying to play a believing game with a child. Each time you think your stupid struggle makes sense, they find another ridiculous twist that doesn't make sense. ("Oh ha, you just think you got me with your superpowers and 10,000 rifles, but I have my vitamins filled with plutonium and teflon, so your jet guns don't work and I'm invulnerable to your superpowers .... don't type a time of infinity PLUS one. ") Children can continue with this luxuriance, because they don't really mind listening to someone because they have a fun time. However, for the VIEWER, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bad gas bolt. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu filmmakers, (a) if you hurt a knife in your back if you are not on PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, ( b) If you repeatedly fall on your back, who has a knife in it, it will hurt and hurt more, unless it is a false strut, (c) when you put a knife in the heart, you die especially in old China where there is no Kaiser Permanent around the corner, (d) Kungfu battles do not last for hours, while 3 snow feet fall, and (e) sometimes it's worth your characters and their motivation to explain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look again at Hero, as it is understandable at least within its own small world.
