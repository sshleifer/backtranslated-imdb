Regarding the merits of the film, it was poorly researched. As others have noted, the movie shows local residents in Iran speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. It's enough to lose credibility for anyone with the slightest knowledge of the area or country. The landscape cannot be anything but real. <br/> <br /> Other factual errors: A train seems to be in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador wears a Fez (the red hat), while the Fez was forbidden by Turkey before the time of the movie. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and Sari was the one they decided to make her exotic.
