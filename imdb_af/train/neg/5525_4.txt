The problem with family dramas is that outside the TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people don't want to see them. And those being watched tend to be sensational and about current or current issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or explore the human condition are not popular. Especially with the young crowd that Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger crowd tends to make movies not only popular but financially successful for studios. <br /> <br /> The specific problems I had with this movie are the cartoon of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame all the Lohan's character (car, drug use, etc.) for what her stepfather did for her. Though unlikely, it's just a little bit to expect the audience to swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as her young Morman son, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the veterinarian, would happen to mean something to her mother, etc. All these elements just didn't do. Really help this movie. It put it more into the element of a situation comedy trying to do one of their "special dramatic episodes", and it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to the DVD The comments, especially for the different alternate ends, can really be seen, this is sharp focus.
