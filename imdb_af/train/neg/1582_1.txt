Oh no! this movie hurts my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's just my growing hatred for the action genre, but even as a kid than me. <br /> <br /> Take a pretty good quick story. Keep the title and throw the rest away. rather use a half assesd future gladiator storyline that is so full of plot holes, in danger of collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, how about the cameras? an unguarded room?) <br /> <br /> The whole movie screams eighty, from the truley's terrible score to the goofy shiny costumes. Ugh. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. I know some people like it, but some people go off to blow up and I don't understand them either.
