I started watching this movie with low expectations, and I just saw it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel (a novel I've never read). <br /> <br /> I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was nothing close, but it's managing your interest. What really leaves this story is the work done by the director and the actors. The movie is over, doesn't have a "nice" shot and no frills, the dialogues are stupid and the special effects are crazy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good is that, as I said, it interests you (I think the book should be good) without using many horror clips. <br /> <br /> My Vote 4/10.
