The 60's is an occasional entertaining movie. Most of this entertainment is laughing at the movie. It is extremely uneven, and contains many annoying elements. For example, take the link between black and white and color. If done right it could be reasonably effective, but because it was poorly done, it became a nuisance and only detracted from the bad experience; Many of the film had a strange feeling for it. The act was not extremely bad for a TV movie, but again it was embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and eventually confusing. How did this family eventually end up with many of the great events of the 1960s? The end was too juicy for my taste; Because it was Hollywood, everything had to end in the end. I would recommend not wasting your time on the 60's and doing something different with your time. I'm glad I watched it in class, not my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my constant thoughts on the movie. I hope you take my advice and stay away from this.
