Based on the personal experiences of director John Singleton's time at the University of Southern California, Higher Learning comes. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters that the film is the basis for the story: Malik Williams, a carefree low-drill athlete who is an African. American man. Kristin Conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and Remy, an unsophisticated, unrelated, white man. All three are overcome by the sudden realities that university life is not as good as it is advertised, as all three are disappointed by being unprepared (Malik), naive (Kristin) and being unwanted (Remy). <Br /> <br /> One good thing about the movie is that it shows that modern American colleges are just high schools, writing great. The colleges are not places to build character, develop potential, or promote personal promotion, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a uniform atmosphere. It is an experience usually built for most students. It would have been good if the film built it over this travesty rather than racial politics. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't and that's where the movies fall apart. Singleton, it seems, had a pretty bad experience in Southern California. Through this film he leaves it all out. There is no need to beat the forest here. Singleton makes the heroes and villains of this piece easily seen. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the movie are almost seen as the heroes here, while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, except for Kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this movie? Black gangsters who came to the aid of a white girl after referring to those who were presumably raped? The convenience that black gang members have at university, while a bunch of skinheads meet in a dark little dorm room? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They look like the third choices for the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore had to play Malik and Kristin, but were not available). O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes, and Regina King were all annoying in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was miserable here as the history professor. Just Michael Rappaport did it well and he thought his character, of the three main characters, had changed the most in the movie. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to live the race and inequality in American college with this movie. And he did it very badly. It was similar to killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is much more complex than it looks and people are everywhere and he needs to know. Higher learning is proof that he didn't understand it at all. Watching the movie, then and now, will just confuse, disappoint, and strive for the same audience. Nonetheless, it won't entertain them in the slightest.
