I'll just put it out here, it was the worst sequel to a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I pick as one of his best movies of all time. Now take away the big songs, add a poor plot that looks like a lost TV program. "Put it together and what do you get?" the biggest load Crud I've ever seen. After I saw it, I thought it was past Disney. Orange must have ended, "and fortunately they have ever lived." not this garbage. This movie does not deserve a successor like this one. I thought it would be like a twist in time, which is moderate but better than that. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? She changed his sides like Iago, but it didn't help anyone.
