I recently watched this movie at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on the worst movies I ever had the accident to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad movies (like "Manos Hands of Fate") and then there are the terribly bad movies. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was incredible, and not in a good way. It felt that the cameraman had deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a grumpy nipple), the lighting was something between 'one man running around with a bulb' and 'non-existent'. The actors were as bad as oceanic, but not as bad as porn actors, giving the impression that every line came as a complete surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the appearance of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees of "Friday the 13'Th". The plot was extremely poor, and the end was even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who is an example of how a horror movie is not supposed to look, or maybe a sleep that sleeps.
