After watching about half of this movie, I noticed something peculiar. I constantly switched myself through TV channels to see what's still going on - not exactly a good movie feature. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed as being in a number of genres, and I have to say that it mostly fails in each of them. 80% by the movie I switched to rather see an old rerun. Bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the one who made it didn't know exactly what to do and was finally in a fusion with no noticeable taste.
