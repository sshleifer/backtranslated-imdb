I caught this movie on a small screen held by members of my college play club. We were warned it would be the "reefer madness" of the game and this movie is more than rendered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who starts his college career again after a "rest" rest semester. What we, the viewer, notice as the film progresses is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game he is once again acquainted with a game group recruiting for a campaign. . <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at many levels. One scene has the group 'playing by candlelight', which is probably the best way to describe it. Although I am sure it was "cultured" in some way, as most gamers know, it is extremely inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions are in well-lit rooms, usually over a few cold tohs and a baking soda. <br /> <br /> The play, while not an Oscar caliber, is also not fun. This is one of Tom Hanks' first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party was another year or two across the horizon. The supportive role, while not very memorable, still delivers decent performances. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the bad lies in the fact that it was a TV movie indicating the "dangers of gambling". See if you and your friends are planning a bad movie month.
