I commented on this when it first made a debut and gave it a "thumb in the middle" review, pointing out that I would give the benefit of the doubt just outside the first episode. In June 2006 I saw six episodes. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is indifferent. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with that. Everything. Beyond the awkward animation and design passing, the stories are ridiculously destroyed and with no character development or apparent interest by the authors of this urge to give any content to any stories. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake. Isn't it also, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE? Is Gotham so much of a turn-through legal system? Or, it's just a complete lack of interest in the authors to put any effort into other villains (see "no character development" above). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, every Joker story is the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gases people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker sets the whole city to gas. <br /> <br /> 3) Save the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode I saw was not a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that unbelieving Cluemaster ... the "Think Thank Thunk" episode with the quiz. It was the only worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I had Batman in my cellar." <br /> <br /> I can't really say what I feel this show is, because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Thanks for the existence of the Timm / Dini / etc. era of bat entertainment, back from Fox and Kids WB days. Things that were good, and I needed to know, could not have been forever.
