These movie stars, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (also written, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly names that "excuse". And with such uplifting sketches as "super models that get a dump" (that's exactly how it sounds), a man robbing a sperm bank (the "Rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotting look, black market fetuses is supposed to to be out of a pot), lots of gay jokes, a shit about a giant phallus that is a superhero and forced abortion. The sketch is painfully unfunny (like "Batman and Rhymer"), the play is not good enough to be considered amateurish and the movie is rough just to be rough ... and stupid. I really believe a group of 8 year olds could make a funny movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this movie led to a lawsuit by "Slap Shot" Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I wouldn't know who to root in this case !!! Apparently, he claimed Scientologists somehow destroyed his reputation and sank this movie. No matter the movie is repulsive junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny (compared to Ebola is funnier) ... and these are the most beautiful things I can say about the movie. <br /> <br /> That way, it's Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porn movie. It's amazing that his career can overcome it.
