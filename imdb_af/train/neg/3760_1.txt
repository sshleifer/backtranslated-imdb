This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever watched. It is ominously boring. I'd rather have had a seminar on creationism than it watched if I knew it would be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta bag loose it from slightly lower than 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews of this movie claim that this movie is inadvertently funny, is absurd and just wrong. Not one thing is funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the bush talking about things that you will not understand or care about, and it is just as lame as people start dying because you do not even know who the people are, because they are so MISSING. Honestly, however, I didn't see it to the end, but it has to say something about how terrible it is. WORST MOVIE EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after I delete this filth from my DVD player, I scrapped it against the cement in front of my home. I didn't want other bunches of customers to fall into the same mistake I made. to rent this movie. Then Zach bent his pants. Thank you for your time.
