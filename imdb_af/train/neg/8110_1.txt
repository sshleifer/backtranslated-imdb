I think Phillip Kaufman reads the stone's Notes version of the Kundera novel and then suggests how to make this movie. Okay, of course it won't have the punch of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to enter and stories he sets up. This movie doesn't even try! Tereza's one dream sequence, which is so important to the book's atmosphere, is processed and makes no sense. Also, and this may be a minor point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks much like Ben Stiller in here (I know it's not really a valid complaint but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywood izing of otherwise fine literature.
