It would have been a morbid fascinating look at the life of one of America's most notorious serial killers, but unfortunately it doesn't even come close. Terrible editing, direction, bad acting, call it. This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched in 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father, but it's not nearly enough to save this stinker. A 1 out of 10.
