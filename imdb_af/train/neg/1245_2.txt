Absolutely the worst movie still by Burton, which increases with every film, which he directed. A tricky script loaded with cliches is only the first of many troublesome aspects of this movie. This is the kind of movie where something happens every time, you will be sure someone hears crying "he lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is very terrible and so is Wahlberg, who can't play it straight and be convincing. Very good effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman. Heston appears in a nonsensical scene to express his best-known catches from the first movie. Very poor results. <br /> <br /> If someone else saw "Sleepy Hollow", they would probably have noticed the falling quality of Burton's films. I heard that this particular project was manufactured by others and that Burton was brought in as a director, in which case his verdict should be questioned. But I think he allowed a possible vision that he could slip earlier in his career; The evidence is in the movies. In 'Sleepy Hollow' he couldn't decide what kind of movie he'd made, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie. The population of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) also made you think it's kind of a monster rally movie (it's never scary, as horror fans know). The movie could not succeed on any horror or comedy, as it was so schizophrenic, and no style was developed to join the two. "Planet of the Apes" is very similar, and the result is more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash", just like sci-fi. He also fell into so many other "big" directors trying to satisfy the entire audience. Word to Burton, if you are there, pick something and do it straight, or use a style to put it all together (like in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you might just as retire because people like me what fans of your movies will stop going.
