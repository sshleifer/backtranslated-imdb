the only worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this movie at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and I thought this movie was accepted for a festival. It was an interesting point of departure, and seemed to go somewhere, but just fell apart when it tried to do everything. First of all, if you are going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. The music consisted of a cheesy piano play that sounded like they were playing on a stereo in the room in which they were filming. The lyrics were terribly written, and when they were not obvious, they were nice rhymes that showed how far they went to try this filmwork. and you will think you will find people who can sing when making music, right? not in this case. Luckily they were half the talk / half of the rhythm most of the time, but when they sang, it curled me. especially when they try to sing in harmony. and it only addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good, but much of the dialogue was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. Of course they didn't have enough coverage on the screens, or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the movie. At least, the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook to make it a musical. I hope investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake.
