After I bought the DVD in a bargain because of the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I knocked it in the DVD player and everything looks good. Fun animated menus and a whole host of extra features ... but when I played the movie myself, that's a deviation. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen bad movies in my time. The comments the movie praises here at IMDB are actually the people who made the movie. So don't believe it unless you want to waste your cash!
