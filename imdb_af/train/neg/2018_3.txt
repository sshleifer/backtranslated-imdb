Don't get me wrong, it's a horrible click movie, but it's a pleasure for Olivia Hussey's fans. It's probably the most intoxicating beauty that the silver screen will ever enjoy. One poster said she was unpleasant to look at. I wonder what his ideal wife looks like. Paris Hil-slet? Blockbuster really should establish a subgenre for this type of movie, as the Fatal Attraction Plot has become a genre for itself. When will Blockbuster accept the "Adultry" section? It will fit well between the drama and action divisions, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who is passionate about an unstable hunting owner who killed his ex-wife, which looks remarkable like me. Hussey. This ne'er-do-well continues to steal Olivia and therefore makes her life a life-hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for characters in movies that have been cheating on their spouses, so I actually didn't wait for Olivia to make it out of this stinker. VIOLENCE: $$ Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get involved in a fist when Denison says he won't stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she's just too good in bed. Olivia will also handle a shooter and can print a round. I'll make you look.) <br /> <br /> NEWS: $$ (Olivia is the queen of short nudity and provides a little here with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - at a distance shot). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We've seen this plot before - a hundred times over and often did much better. Guilty, if he tries to decipher why this movie is a dud, William Riead is The man's dialogue is sofomories and moronies, the man has no story telling abilities and fails to build faith, human reactions to the plot, these people, from the top strata of society, speak like middle school children - with a habit to sleep during the English class, I listed Riead on the Never-to-be-Again-Again list.) <br /> <br /> WARNING: $ (The play is not usable, like the insiders says, but much of Riead's young manuscript is being hampered by Olivia Hussey calling on Anthony Jonh Denison, a strange and "crazy" face when he starts stalling. Hussey, who is still beautiful, offers the best performance here, but Denison is equal to Don Murray was basically right there - his character didn't fall out and Edward Asner, a wound A lot of actor when it has given something to the fabric is badly used in this movie.)
