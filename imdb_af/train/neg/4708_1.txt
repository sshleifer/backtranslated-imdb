Oh, dear! The first time I heard of this bad performance was when one of my friends shouted like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while playing video games. I thought he had "Johny Quest" confusion (incidentally, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life ") and changed the" Quest "with" Test. "It's strange that I'm wrong, but actually was I was wrong, he didn't change anything, he heard of this show. <br /> <br /> One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released, I wasn't sure what was the plot of this show, so I attacked myself to watch it and here's my answer: "I want to have my damn back" (Because I watched this crap and "My Gym Partner is a Monkey". <br / > <br /> This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen, firstly, the beginning, with the dumbest song in the world, then the plot.Oh, where are my ways? It's about a boy who has AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters, who has a lab and makes experiments with their own brother OHHH, now I see why his name John y TEST, he is the test of his sister trials. <br /> <br /> You know, I honestly miss Dexter's La b (before being transformed into the new Dexter, also a total crap). This is a bad copy of the old good show, except that this show is incredibly bad. Don't look at it, make something more productive in that half hour and look at this crap.
