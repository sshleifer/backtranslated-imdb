I do not believe the praise for this movie. The play and the movie was a ripoff by Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes he was Olivier, and Reeves wished he was Caine. Caine even had the nerve to do a Sleuth remake with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one who did the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This movie was made during a time of Caine's career when it was clear that he had to pay gambling debt. He'll do anything for money. He will die in such award-winning movies like this, and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What the praise for this movie looks like is Reeves's death. He deserves better than being remembered for this lousy movie. And so do Caine. This movie can be found in the $ 5.97 bin at Walmart. Along with jewels such as "The Island" and "Blame It On Rio".
