If you thought the original of 83 was bad, try this contemporary masterpiece. How can it be worse if you ask? Well ... at least in the first one you had, Ally Sheedy threatened in a sports race. Unlike updated graphics, contemporary themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley, it is unfortunately the same sad story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line goes into the story. And for anyone who hasn't seen the first one ... think yourself lucky that you just watched it once. Maybe in another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
