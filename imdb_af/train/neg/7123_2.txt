Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horror story finds that a newly married man (John Hudson) and the woman (Peggy Weber) are being haunted by the memory of his former wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty house and lily dam. Is the man really trying to manage his already anxious wedding screen? Or is it the learning challenge gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol) who has been caring for the home's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house? This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved the whole way the final. Special effects are quite bad, even by 1958 standards. At times I swear the screaming skull sounds a lot like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the film as Revered Snow is character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the lurking gardener (Nicol) is the director of the movie. You can catch it as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
