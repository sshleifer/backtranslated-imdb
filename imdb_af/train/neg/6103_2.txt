To be honest, I am amazed at the positive voices this film has received. The film only spans its lifespan of 81 minutes and the audience has to go through it all the way. Actually, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She gets a little pathetic dialogue and she handles it very well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I think the highlight of his performance is seeing the man wearing the beach, with tiger pattern chummies .... giving me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a drilling and pathetic presentation of a suffering vampire that misses the day (to see a much more convincing version of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4). The film moves so slowly and is only positively spelled by Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This movie can honestly only be recommended for the mortal followers of Charlie Spradling (what I am, and I still had a rough time to see it!).
