Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his highest hold on the Mockumentary subgenre is not in the least trouble, especially through this extremely intrepid jab at RPG gamers. The jokes are over. Not enough fabric to keep the typical length of a (especially rancid) SNL shit, much less the 87 horrible minutes I've turned to watch this fool. The great William Katt (Biggest American Hero, Home) deserves much better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I have seen it worthwhile in my mind and it is about it, so hopefully I will save someone such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with different roles; 4 deleted scenes; & Stage Car <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom Extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter Egg: Lighten the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
