The worst kind of movie. In fact, the US Declaration of Independence has been replaced with a plasma screen, which has deceived the museum's security for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> The plasma screen, which theoretically runs off less than 2 seconds, will see the battery, if it has a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required power, which it would not. <Br /> <br /> This would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and a converter, but the system won't fit in this case. Sorry to be anal but it's not even close to likelihood. The rest of the movie wasn't much better and I still asked why the budget could not be donated to charity or me.
