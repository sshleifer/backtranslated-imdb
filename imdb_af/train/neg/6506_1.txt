Unless you are a geeky film student who has to see everything, this movie will not just waste your time and money and a great disappointment, but it will also make you angry. <br /> <br /> There may be a story worth telling somewhere, but Hopkins has decided to hide and encode it under so many uncanny chaotic layers of seemingly random audio-video microscreens. It runs the viewer's patience after a short while. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone like Hopkins choose such a heavy, tough and highly unstable project as his first screenplay, first score and third movie can be guessed by anyone. Perhaps he had played so long in the mind until it became unrecognizable as it had become, not even for himself. The result shows that he generally does not have enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest Carpenter and Lynch movies, to name just two unconscious movie makers, have 90% more cohesion, 95% fewer characters and 99% more story flow. <br /> <br /> Mr. Anthony aimed for the stars, but unfortunately missed by some light years. Hold on to acting, in that department you are an unmatched giant and no one has to ask you more, not even yourself!
