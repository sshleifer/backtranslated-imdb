I had to write a review of this movie after I made another comment and said it was Sidney Poitier's best movie. Poitier has just returned from more than a decade of break in film performance and he is clearly insane here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and this does not include this. 5 of his films are on the AFI's list of top 100 inspirational movies, not here either. Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker suggest a dangerous psychopath to cross the border into Canada. Some of the comedy's efforts in this film have clearly failed, and Berenger and Poitier's band work was striking and uncomfortable (not helped by a completely bloody script). Kirstie Alley (as the hostage) was in use, and was almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Some attempts are being made, for example when you are trying to guess which of the five men on a fishing trip is the killer (all of them are typical villains). I understand that this is the whole appeal to most fans there. I guess who it was and I didn't really try hard. <br /> <br /> If you are a Messenger fan, look at the Sniper (1993), you even get Billy Zane who she sees well. It's much better. All in all, I will kill 3/10. It's not risky, and it's just too right for me.
