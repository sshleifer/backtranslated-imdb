This movie was awesome !! (Not quite as good as the Leif Garrett masterpiece Longshot), but still awesome !! I thought Ashley looked freakin 'great compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought they could put such places and almost get away with them. Dad was a while and Mom was a bit too nice with Helmit Head. I give it 4. Anyone who likes this movie, watch Longshot.
