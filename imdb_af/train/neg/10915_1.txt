I believe that war movies should try to convey the terror of war, to avoid idealism and to respect certain rudimentary military principles. Zvezda hardly does the first. Zvezda was a Russian war movie, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, lush scores, Slavic cheekbones and brutal Germans. What I didn't need was the na√Øve love of non-affair, the unrealistic stupid warfare and the abuse of the syrup soundtrack in a movie that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) but abusive our sense of history endorsement about the liberation of Poland. A missing event as a movie, but not as a propaganda.
