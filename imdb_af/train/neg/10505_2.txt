If you like "Blair with" you will like this one. It has the same everlasting camera work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and exciting moments. <br /> <br /> It also has Tom Savini, so if you're Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "" From Dusk Till Dawn "you're in for a surprise. He is also an icon and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the lightest movie I've seen for a long time, and I've also seen quite a few movies - bad people. I can tell you that I entertained most horror movies in some ways, but it was just a pure waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp plastic teeth ... No, I'm just joking. I must have missed before I hit the "shape" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
