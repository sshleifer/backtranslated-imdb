I'm not going to waste my time, write an essay and waste your time. However, I want to say that everyone who is familiar with this movie is even ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can't play that card, and I mean the patriotic map of nationalism so people can't watch this movie. it is a movie that expresses its free will in this country (oh yes i played that card) although the director is german and every time he reaches a camera earns a bang on the pulse, but the world is full controversy. It's the same thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It is a comedy, laughs and becomes disgusting, not disgusting, its dark humor and of course you do not have the heart to take it, the past is over, yes people remember those who have been lost, but the time to continue to go was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides being insane, and who needs a soul?
