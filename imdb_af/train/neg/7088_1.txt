I was subjected to this horror by my wife, trying to shut it down after 10 minutes, but was forced through the whole thing. It has to be, hands off, the most gruesome look of a movie ever ... <br /> <br /> There were good script moments, such as: <br /> <br /> Sammy - "If she's over here immediately she gets a bonus "Mrs - a Boner?" Sammy - "No, a bonus" <br /> <br /> Summarizing: Terrible writing, terribly perceptive and incredibly illogical.
