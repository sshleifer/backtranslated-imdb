As a big fan or the Cracker series, I wait 7 years for the next addition. This episode I fear is just not the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and becomes involved in a murder investigation, a soldier plagued by flashbacks of his Northern Ireland tournament, on a deadly spree. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is set up and how fitz goes to the killer. It is all fat to feast on. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good scenes in Northern Ireland flashbacks filmed.
