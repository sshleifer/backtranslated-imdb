This film is overblown, predictable, predictive, and hollow at its core. The institutions are true to the era, but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. The passing on artefacts stops the action and makes almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleeping as Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can't give a character depth just by emptying your face! The content did not observe the truth of Paul Newman. It is a dud wrapped in an atom bomb shell.
