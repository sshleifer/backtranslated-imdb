Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic apology for the waste of film to be recycled as toilet paper, recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First, it was made. Second, people saw it. Thirdly, some people voted the best movie they ever saw. If a monkey can make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure it'll be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments (even Godzilla had some cool special effects). This movie's moment was when I left the theater. The only thing that could possibly make this movie would be worse if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to go for an hour and a half for half an hour, I will take a look at a can. If someone has not completely despised this movie, I am sorry for you and your children and your children's children; However, unlike Springer's beliefs, I am not clear that children have sex.
