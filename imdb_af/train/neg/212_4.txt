Closer to reality and more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a tough show. Once again, this picture really just falls into the 'breakin' maze, but at least we get some fun from the plot. It's about the lives of three young friends and a younger brother who grows up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a DJ, another artist who creates' waves', while little bro 'Lee is a hot hip hop dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan can't really hear the story, though, and his young player also struggles with their characters. That is why it is almost entirely the funky music and the 'fresh' dance to save the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is sharp again for both club and street screens, but it alone is not enough to light up Beat Street "to higher altitudes. Unfortunately, the movie is really getting late after a little while hope it can only be interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
