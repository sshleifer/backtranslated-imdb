It was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a mother-in-law, her husband left her because she hadn't been with him (he loved Reagan and wanted to turn his back on society). Occasionally I had problems with the series. Let's say to myself, is it the same noble Michael Stivic who opposes Archie Bunker's right-wing vineyard philosophies? The series went on, but it didn't have any pizazz. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers got from All The Family, was long gone. Perhaps, if the series receives a different name and is presented as totally independent of All In The Family, it may have worked out. Oh, this is show business.
