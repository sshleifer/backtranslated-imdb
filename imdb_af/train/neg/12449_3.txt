Sondra Locke stinks in this movie, but then she was a horrible 'actress'. Unfortunately, she is dragging everyone else (including then the real life friend Clint Eastwood in the drain with her. But what did Clint Eastwood think when he agreed to die in this one? One reading of the script had told him that this one Going to be a real mustache, it's a particularly bad story, basically no story or plot, add bored, bad acting, even from the normally good Eastwood, there's absolutely no action except some arguments and so far This film is at the top of the heap of natural sleep amplifiers ... Wow! Can a movie be a bit more boring? I think it looks dry or grass grows, can be more fun, a real stinker. Don't store with this one.
