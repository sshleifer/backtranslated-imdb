1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the talented movie, this movie is too predictable and just estimates it's the audience. The movie audience is not stupid and I hope they won't fill a few star bags again, despite what they're involved with. We think this movie is about something with Connery's conviction against capital punishment in the beginning, but it seems to be nothing more than a standard, for the sake of the audience, from the mill, let us never overcome it. . We are drawn into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when needed in the story, and we are ready for this thing to be before the end. Yes, there's a good thing here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role, but the story doesn't work from nearly the beginning to the long-awaited end.
