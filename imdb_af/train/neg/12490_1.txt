I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 at a fairly large video retailer to do an "indie" type of film research, as I just finished my own function and it was. Now if I feel about my skills as first director I just sit with a plate of cookies and cut. Within minutes I feel good !!! <br /> <br /> I hate to talk about another movie maker, so I use only constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. the time. It really helps 2. When shooting video, lift your scenes and darken in the computer later in the post. 3. Close-ups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit ahead <br /> <br /> let them talk so we know what's going on and who is talking. 5. Never point the back of a door while waiting for someone to open it. Damn is worth the $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> The real horror will get the reviews. Severed it here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit ... they have spread.
