* Can contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I bent backwards to be honest with this movie. I knew it was Madonna. I knew it had lasted a whole week in the theaters. I knew it had very bad reviews. I didn't expect a deep and thorough investigation of class, culture and sexuality as we found in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, greedy Gorgon who goes on holiday with her handsome husband and freaky friends (the brunette is as bad as Madonna, showing some very dumb facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first beat of the ship, delighting the Madonna character in humiliation and treatment like dirt in every scene they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Simply because the plot needs it so that later the two of them are destroyed on a deserted Mediterranean, the tables will be turned around and he will teach her a lesson. Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and abusing two other thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a stupid, simplistic, superficial movie from start to finish. Madonna gives a typical wood performance. There are many dumb plays: Madonna sings and dances on the question of Giannini, a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes where he hits her and kicks her in the butt. Guy Ritchie does his "stylish" editing that is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogue I've heard in a big movie in several years. The end is juicy and indescribable. It's basically "The Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter. Perhaps Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on proving herself as a skilled actress. Please, Madge, give it to you and yours. However, this is not her worst movie. The distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She did nothing worse than not ... yet.
