The film has no faith with the helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60's and 70's. The only part of the movie you could believe was that Germany wanted to know where the landing would be. Ignoring the moment the British caught all the spies, but even if they didn't, they would not have allowed to move around, just to ensure the Germans were landing in Calais. It's not one big thing that doesn't make the movie work. This is the highlight of all the wrong things that the movie fails. Bad directing, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (not at all), just combine to drop the movie. Generally, spies in the woodwork should fade. The tension comes in with the spy wondering whether the information they have is valid or not and worries about the detection. On this one, the game was over from the beginning. This spy did everything except spying. Your only chance to get something that has some degree of credibility and can cause some tension can be to read the book.
