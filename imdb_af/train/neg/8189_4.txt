It's always hard to do a brother or sister better in your life than you, always a struggle to get out of that shadow and don't let bitterness keep you from your family. So imagine that your older brother is Santa and then think how hard it should be. This is the point of departure here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred, an embittered loser who spends much of his energy and ensures that people do not turn around to expect good things to happen to them or to give his brother. , Santa Claus (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for the exposure of the limelight, famous, hungry, slightly creepy man Fred would want to portray. Then you won't know, Fred needs a financial favor and needs to fix it by helping his brother on Christmas. And follow hilarity and life lessons. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what has to happen. The reality is that Kevin Spacey is getting a Christmas movie with a few good moments from Vaughn's patented, fast-paced talk, a ridiculous music force that is nowhere to be. Kevin Spacey plays an auditor to close Santa's operation (and he's one of the worst bad things I've seen already), not enough of the beautiful Elizabeth Banks in a sumptuous Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his eleven outfit (to be honest, he is a highlight though) and a movie that also swims in bitterness to feel like a good season, but too slender in the last half, to feel like a fun stamp on all the bad things about the commercialism of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is also for the ride, Kathy Bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style, you'll find something here to enjoy here . Unfortunately, there is very little else to recommend this season stinker. Outside of Vaughn's rantings, the script does nothing good, except for a particularly good scene in which a hilarious support group is involved that addresses a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin's direction is as mediocre and stiff as the 20p Christmas card you sent the aunt, you haven't seen in 10 years, and it seems simple to put the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care, which will ensure a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get a burnt, dull lump with too much sugar on top. Forget it and paste the hilarious Elf again if you want a wonderful, modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See it if you want: The Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause.
