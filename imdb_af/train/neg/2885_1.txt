I can't really say what I think about this movie, it's against the guidelines, I watched a lot of movies, and it must be the worst. I have a very low budget, and I guess all the money in the butchery screens, because I could work better with a b & w 8mm camera and a monkey crew. It was so bad I just registered to comment, because I had to tell someone, but it wasn't enough. But it's worth me 2 cents, I suggest borrowing it from a poor juice that hired it and saw it for itself. Because I probably won't waste the money again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you didn't make it to the rental site when they didn't refund your money. =)
