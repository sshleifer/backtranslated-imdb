There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it has tried too much with too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money just wasn't there to do justice to the story. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (author / director) writes credit at "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which was a cash smash. However, the movie has some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when you shouldn't make a movie. If he had been waiting for a few years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the consequences. (not to mention that he could get a company with money.)
