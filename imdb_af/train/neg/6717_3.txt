It was god horrible. The story was all over the place and more often than not, I was confused because of terrible editing. I didn't feel any sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial people without dimension. Cheesy, cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, even though she was decent. I don't know what it is trying to be, but how shocked was I when they showed this waste on Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. You think a channel like it will show more quality movies. There are many, much better gay and lesbian themed movies out there. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who have slipped me at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that it just wasn't worth it. If you catch it on the TV, ok, but otherwise it won't. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad, I can count them on one side), otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well. The lighting was far away in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add to something that has done just about nothing. <br /> <br /> I can't deny Johnny Rebel. It's pretty hot (without the blonde hair of course). Badly his acting did nothing to me. Hold on with real porn, friend. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
