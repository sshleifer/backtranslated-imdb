Misleading Advertising ... I've seen an advertisement for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power who says: From Scarface and Carlito's Way manufacturer. LETS really gets it ... Michael Bergman didn't make Scarface. He was actually a room assistant. 'for Scarface. Not to take Bergman's talent away ... but in my opinion he should have a little more class. I think I can talk to the masses when I say ... We hate to lie blatantly. As far as the movie goes, it was at best poor. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work on this movie. Overall this film did not do a good job of filling in the spaces for Carlito's Way. Obviously, this project was an attempt to quickly make a good role.
