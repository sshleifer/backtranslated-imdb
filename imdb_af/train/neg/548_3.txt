I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and decided to see this movie that my roommate rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried for the first time when I saw it," she said. Perhaps, compared to other Bollywood movies, it earns a 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my lifetime, it doesn't earn more than a 3. Any movie where I can actually guess what's next not going to happen is not good for me. The characters are incredible, how the action is not realistic at all and their motives are confronted. It's over dramatic and the songs aren't that good. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All the emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not at all realistic. Any emotion or connection between characters who are the least subtle should be enlarged with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between the father and son was more than one between friends as one between a parent and a child, without having to bring it over a five-minute song. The stupid, comical relief, complete with lag tracks, wasn't funny or needed (we get it, Laxman isn't the sharpest tool in the barn). If a movie is trying to evoke tears by the most hackneyed possible, it just doesn't make sense, just a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally, if someone has terminal stage lung cancer, their son who lives with them will know something wrong was without telling. Too many plot holes to count. Initially, the movie was amusing and cute in the way Bollywood movies are for people who don't look so diligently, but it just got boring. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartbreaking and the best way to do this usually doesn't have all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartbreaking parts at the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Perhaps it had much more depth than other Bollywood movies I saw, but not much at all. I spent more time on the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny. I didn't dump a single tear, and I didn't feel, but I was overwhelmed with a sense of horror in trying to make a dramatic end. I don't recommend this movie if you want to see something good, I recommend it if you want to see a Bollywood movie that's kind of sad.
