Of course, Unhinged gained a little familiarity. The shocking thing I found about the movie, however, was the amateurishness in all sections. The blood loss I could handle was much harder to take. The terribly dramatic, scary editing, horrible direction, lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take. <br /> <br /> Three girls heading to a music festival fall into a gorge during a gorge storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who transports them to a nearby house. The homeowner, an old lady and her female daughter, welcomes the girls so they can stay for a few days to recover. But someone doesn't want the girls to ever leave! One by one they fall into an invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> For a long time and with some of the worst shows ever in a horror movie (and it takes a bit), Unhinged is a truly horrible movie. The music is a complete mess (it seems like a three year old has been released on a synthesizer) and as such complements the film perfectly. Just a few bloody scenes to the end and a little careless nudity saves Unhinged to get the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you're a horror complete (and unfortunately I'm), you'll want to see it marking it from the Video Nasty waiting list. But be warned? It's really really bad.
