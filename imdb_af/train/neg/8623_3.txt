This movie is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) who catches a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who expresses an insurance company led by a Kelly Lin. Basically, what the police are trying to do to the thief, knows them somehow. Covered by handsome actors, stunning main actress and great camera shots of Hong Kong scenes, this movie really has nothing at all. It's all flash, and the flash is also boring. I lost all interests a third of the way in the movie, and after that there is no redeeming quality except for the cinematography that looks good. Just think of this movie if you can do it for free. Also consider stopping to watch the movie in the movie for 20 minutes as it is all the same until the end: USE. 10/06
