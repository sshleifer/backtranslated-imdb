I now watch this movie on WTN because it was the channel on which the TV was turned on when I turned it on. It's a non-credible and pretty boring story about a minister's wife (Alexandra Paul) who is played with a young stud / drifter (with washboard abs), played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey sweep off his shirt and beat Alexandra. I get the feeling that he is supposed to do nothing, and therefore he wastes with skinny Alexandra Paul. It's not really important, because as I said, he took off his shirt a lot and I just caught a glimpse at the bat. There is a lot of scissors on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
