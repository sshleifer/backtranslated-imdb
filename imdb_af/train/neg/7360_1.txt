It's one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is especially due to the factual impossibility (such as an obvious agent acting as a bank loan officer, making it clear that he is talking to someone through a thread or the scene where scientists accept it is safe to do so) entering a room in which virus was released although it did not find it a viable host, it does not mean it will never find one], the cheap sets (the bank seems to be poorly built to look like a dungeon ) and the bad scene, this is the story of an organized crime group who successfully stole a capsule of the deadly virus, but decided to remove it from a bank security case, while doing a bank cage while the same FBI agents informed of this and at the same time erupting a terrible earthquake, needless to say, the aftermath of the earthquake is messy in more ways than one, but the results do not make a seductive action movie, but instead a n which was apparently z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (Perhaps that's why some of the screen texts on the package are chosen to be created with computer graphics rather than using actual screen texts from different rows of the movie.) What Hell Ron Perlman did in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was so ashamed to be in it, because I had to look at it.
