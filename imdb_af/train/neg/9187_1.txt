In the past I watched some pretty poor movies, but how wondered when they made this movie. Have the production crew turned into zombies when they got the idea to do it, for sure you must be brain dead to find any pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and enjoy "shooting em-up" games, but merging the spectacular scenes of the game has just made this ridiculous and unstoppable. <br /> <br /> As most have said, there was hardly a script and the acting was poor. I won't waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who occupies this movie above 4 must be part of the production company or Sega, or they have a very renewed concept of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> I have to say, I was more annoyed with the video store, which gave it a thumb, which led me to rent it. Thanks, I had a second movie to see how to restore my faith in movies. <br /> <br /> Comic bookman will be right if he ever said the worst movie ever!
