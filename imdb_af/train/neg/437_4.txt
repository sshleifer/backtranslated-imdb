(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie after I heard it was clever and spiritual. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the movie would have been acceptable: the way the relationship between a man and a woman develops, through all the problems and problems that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me like the whole movie was two things. <br /> <br /> First, the movie was so down-to-earth that it seems, by describing the problems a couple needs to solve one day, <br /> <br /> Second, the overall weakness of the production, with scarcely understandable dialogues. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
