It started badly, as with the three women who act like the sympathy of junior high school wedges who treat their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate, for the one who tells the best "man" story and then it gets worse - - spoiler warning = - = falling with Andie's character for the young organ player who was 14 years old (she is the head of an English school, believe it or not), just to destroy him by her bitch - of hell 'girlfriend'. .. and then it is basically uncompromising blowjob: she forgives her friend and ends the organ player's love child and the 3 women as they started, more gin drinking and more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolate into the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
