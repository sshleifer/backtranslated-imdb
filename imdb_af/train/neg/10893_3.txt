It's one of those movies that should have been better than it seems to be. I'm afraid to think what the Blockbuster-approved modifications should look like, because the director's track on DVD was a drill of epic relationships. Of course, you don't expect it to be "The Godfather", but an acting class or two can also be useful. <br /> <br /> There were also so many cute guys in this movie, but they were outraged. I like to watch as much as the next guy, and I even have the right to expect a little more. However, this was not a total loss; At least we got a Drew Fuller's (covered) litter and really disturbing hairstyle. And there is Huntley Ritter who looks even better than he did in "Bring It On" (and so well). There is always a silver lining, children. You just have to look really hard for it. And sometimes you need to use your pause button.
