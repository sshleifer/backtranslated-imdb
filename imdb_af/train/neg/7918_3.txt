I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie from me was a 1 out of 10, Lacy Chabert's performance, which I thought the multiple personalities played well. For me, she was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was beautiful as always, but I got her role beautifully, so I don't think one can say her acting was great. <Br /> <br /> As for male chief Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in the hospital series of the cheese 1980. <br /> <br /> All I could do was remember. But the terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing I've seen in the past.
