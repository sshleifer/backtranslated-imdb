Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this author must read it. I hate using it as authors Spark notes use for which a novel goes. This movie is unbearable to see if you have read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole 'red room' is so played that I wonder why they even bother to insert it. In the book is the 'red room' 'is shadow for the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is being treated so badly in the film. I'm sure she's happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head. The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it.
