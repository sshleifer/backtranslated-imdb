Oh yes, "That projected man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <br /> <br /> Oops, sorry. Yes, "The Projected Man". Well, it's a British sci-fi yawnfest about nothing.

Deaf, drunk, starchy, stiff and fragile, "The Projected Man" is 77 solid minutes of nothing, with no one at all. Dust as dishes. Fabrics as doorknobs. Deaf like Ethan Hawke - we really talk DULL here, people! But wait for our dull cousins ​​from across the lake, the MooCow will now do a proper review for "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... ... <8.
