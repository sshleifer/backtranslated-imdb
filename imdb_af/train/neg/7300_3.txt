This movie is about a group of five friends renting a cabin in the bush. One of the friends gets a terrible carnivorous virus. Suddenly, the friends change each other in a desperate attempt not to contract the disease itself. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horrible movie. For one, try to be a lot of genres simultaneously. Is it supposed to be a tribute, a crook, a black comedy or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody can tell it. First there is a serious scene and a second change, it gets funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is pretty vague, except the end. I love the end. <br /> <br /> But apart from the end, I was very disappointed and disgusting. The violence is crooked, more away from the screen than to be scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening and sometimes random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What should we get from it? The same girl will bite one of the characters. Was it supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were decent, and many were rather amateurish. I don't care about most characters. I like the plot, but the execution is terrible. As a horror movie, I didn't know what it was trying to do. I didn't find it funny, tense or scary. Eventually you left indifferent and thought, "What have I done now?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to that question.
