While I watched this movie, I thought, OK, it'll be fine anytime. I went wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was over. A full waste of 92 minutes. All the seriousness of the best part was when the Wendigo finally arrived, which was the end and you couldn't see him so well. And the tail end was also very stupid. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen, but it was a slack. The worse part was there was more talk of the Wendigo was there Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you certainly can't tell this movie.
