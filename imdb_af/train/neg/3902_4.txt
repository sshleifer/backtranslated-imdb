It is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the writing was written to look as much as possible about the book. But the acting was terrible. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who I believe was a true image of Emma in the book, all the other actors tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, didn't feel at all, and through the whole movie you couldn't "grow" his love for Emma at all. It had a terrible impact on Kate Beckinsale, who was trying to read her leading role as well as her partner. In addition, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, has no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. That's why she doesn't look as sad as she is portrayed in the book. The movie's settings are too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have suggested Emma Woodhouse to put on a more fashionable and elegant way she does here. The end is too long. It's good that it looks like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending for a movie. And again, I can't see any sense of happiness in the face of Mr. Knightley didn't. In conclusion, I believed this adaptation was true to the book, but with poor actors. The movie seems to have been made without any budget. I would prefer to see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, even though it is clear that it was made as a "blunt" than to see these actors (except the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) throughout writing.
