The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a prospective student made a movie and couldn't decide whether he wanted art or violence. Iowa can be the movie he made. I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to artiness, both films had good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa. This movie stumbles to a preliminary end. I have to admit it has consistency. This movie is bad from start to finish and not worse or better in any part. The actors did all they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why should she demonstrate it in this maze.
