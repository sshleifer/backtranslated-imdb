So this movie ran on TCM in the beautiful hours. Several problems with the movie were clear from what I saw. First, the adults did not have age when the children did 10 years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems and for some reason the actor who played the youngest boy, like the oldest, did the 10 years. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge black screen gap appeared. This is too bad, because although the writing remained to be desired, Bergman and Russell both performed well in the film. It is a pity that the big piece is missing, but what is here is viewable. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was all intact. The writing makes little sense that Bergman's character is sent away when the children are small, but then returned to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the timelines also don't make sense. There is a stock market accident that appeared in 1929, but the kids are growing to fight in the First World War. All the acting by the fans in this movie is fine. Just wonder what was in the gap of the movie I couldn't see as it was missing.
