When I was back in the 1970s, a local theater had children's children every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anyone remembers it?). They showed this thing one year around Christmas. Some friends and I were going to see it. I expected a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly baptized (and you can tell) and truly creepy movie. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (don't ask me what the two do in the same movie) Satan (a joker in a stupid devil costume full of horns!). The images curled me in my seat. I always found Santa Claus spooky to start with, so it didn't help. The man in Satan's suit did not help. But what made me really wrong was the loggers who pulled Santa's sled. As he excels and the creepy sound they have made and the movements, I remember nightmares about those things! All these years I still remember walking out of that theater, disturbed more than a little by what I saw. My friends were so scared of it. I just saw an ad on TV and all the nightmares came back. It's a creepy, disturbing, little Christmas movie that will probably scare off the pants from any little child who sees it. Avoid this one - unless you really want to punish your kids. It gets a 1.
