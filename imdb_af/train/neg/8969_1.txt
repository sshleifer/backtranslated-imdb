The plot does not offer any new excitement, it even starts the same as cube I. This time, there are no other improvements to the cube machinery, except to be an extra unguarded exit. The characters were not as well worked out as in the first episode, they just became "flat" as in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone brings it to the normal exit, the person will be asked, as "do you believe in God?", it is not really creative or original and, in my opinion, it does not fit it in the secret of the cube. Actually, there is nothing else to say about it.
