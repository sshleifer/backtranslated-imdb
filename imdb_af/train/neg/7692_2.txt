There are some previous comments on this that stand across the whole stone's abundance of clich√©s throughout - and I totally agree on the characters AND the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I want to read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally terrible "Showgirls" I've never seen before - and her performance here, though not terrible, is barely the standards of Lifetime it's worse rate. There was not a depth of her character, but it probably should not have been. If so, it would have brought the film out of balance, because there was no hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, artist or depiction. <br /> <br /> The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee kissed her in the hall was laughing. Her husband's initial response and advice was also so. (Forrest Gump, who attacked Jenny's boyfriend in his car, provided more realistic, intelligent action, and he was spiritually challenged). The grumpy, unashamed lawyer (apology for the dismissal) The father of the legendary student actually did something worthy of praise in his performance: he was both legally and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no common thing. Her lawyer was more of an insensitive nerd, not even unknown in the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed it), the police were such a collection of insensitive offenders, rather dependent on Barney Fife, without Andy, to enforce all law enforcement and investigation in your community. handle. I know most of the actual police are getting a little short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the "Law and Order" series, and so forth - but daggers of this level appear " a pile at a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a sort of "story in a story" fascinated by Josh's conspiracy that he was the "victim" of his teacher. This print performance in the story was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. It was something of a performance, like going from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This whole lame situation had to be solved in about 15 minutes - in real life, to a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with involved man. But then it would have followed the confronted drama, and left an hour's empty movie in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the author (s) here, with their endorsement, could even do worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "rectified", it was reached in about 45 seconds, without any indication of what measures could occur in any "real world" context for the offender and his parents or whether they might be a kind of road to find salvation. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because it does have a little light "fascination".
