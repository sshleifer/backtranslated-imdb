Whoa Nelly! I heard a lot of mixed reviews for this audience ... but one of me is going to hardcore horror judges who found it really disappointing. He was right on the nose! This movie was performed by pure amateurs. They had to do once, maybe two on each scene, the movie was so chased. The writing was also poor. They had lines that were trying to be unique, but failed. Miserably. "Get your cakes from me!" Oh man, I hate it if movies try to do it. It happens all the time with comedies ... but with a horror movie and with some average actors .... the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative about this movie was the damn scene again. It was awful. Except by the little Asian guy who worked the booth. I thought he was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh! T-tourists on holiday in Asia. They end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia-run slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. The only reason it is considered horror is because of the murder. There was no trace of tension. <br /> <br /> I love many other horror fans who die to get their bloody roots. But unfortunately with a big capital you, the movie was incredibly disappointing. I enjoyed the single pause and the blood effects. The flashy chicks were also like that. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is Ryan Nicholson's first feature length, and for the most part, he failed. There is no denial, he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror. I pray that his next movie won't play like another B horrorflick ... unless he tells us this is what it's going to be. Even after this disappointment, I want to give Ryan another shot. From what I saw of him, he is a real, dedicated man for the genre. Good luck next time, because it was bad news.
