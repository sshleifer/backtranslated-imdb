In SÃ£o Paulo, the higher middle class teenagers Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class, they go to a drug and drink festival. The next day, after their classes, the date of Cristiano came to his home the previous night and the three friends raped the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decides to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother comes, starts with Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaks her neck. The trio decide to dump and burn the bodies in a garbage dump, but other tragedies also happen at night. The controversial and shameful "Cama de Gato" is an overpowering pretentious crap about the alienation of the youth, and is definitely the worst Brazilian movie I've seen for many years. The level, tragic and dark story is actually a bad humor comedy of bad taste. The script is not funny, with silly lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and stupid footprints with interviews with moron teens in the beginning and in the end. The acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but no talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promising Caio Blat in this trash. The camera, framework, cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality. The sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (probably this is a plus, as this movie sucks). The gangbang is very realistic and is used to promote this mediocre film in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Bed of the Cat")
