Watch this movie many years ago enjoy much of Gregory's Girl. It was. The plot was vaguely unpleasant with the teacher and his girlfriend wore 14-15 year old girls in very short skirts. Previous commentators seem to think it doesn't matter, but I found it rather nasty. If you have children at school, the last thing you want to think is that every young teacher wants his pupils. We were amazed at the censorship. In addition, the movie was just a waste of time. The writing was poor and John Gordon Sinclair was trying too hard to create his school boy image, slightly curly and off the wall. Why anyone wants to desire him is incredible. This movie fails on all scores for me. Terrible. Please don't waste your time watching it. Life is too short
