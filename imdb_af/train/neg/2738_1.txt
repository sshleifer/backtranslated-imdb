Trash / bad movies are usually not bad, because I will find them enjoyable. This one is so bad that I'm out of words to describe it - it's under "bad". There is an instruction in the beginning of the movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen beer couldn't help me put the whole movie. One tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL, which is definitely unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously that is. This tagliner had a plan to request you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting this one, put it down! If you think to buy, don't think! If you unfortunately want this DVD, don't play it, throw it in the trash immediately.
