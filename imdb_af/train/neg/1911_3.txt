Formula movie man who wants girl, man who will lie to get by girlfriend, guy who will get the best friend to help in a far-reaching way (comedus reliefus, no?) To help girl, etc. This man was killed, and with the exception of a few z-rated outings, it was done better. <br /> <br /> Steel plot aside, the lead is attractive and there are a few good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his acting came close to calling. Not a complete loss, but nothing new in this ugly case.
