Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean ever. My wife and I were out of our mind within 10 minutes. Not too boring, it's totally unbelievable. Women (non-lesbian) do not bathe - also do not "accidentally" kiss. Brothers and sisters do not live well in their 30's and run to swing and dance in football in the central park. Men don't think their wife and sister kissed the night before the wedding and never discussed it with the woman. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham may be the worst actress in movies today. She smiled as she cried and vice versa. The only movie she's ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she didn't act. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how bad this movie was.
