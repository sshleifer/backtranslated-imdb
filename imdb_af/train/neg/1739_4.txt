Watching That Lady In Ermine I wondered what Betty Grable was doing in a project that looked like Marlene Dietrich. Someone who decided Fox at the 20th century is one sex symbol, as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck knew better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays an Italian count of the 19th century whose domain was invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captain of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor, whose portrait in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished pedigree, now sees no parable in Doug and another intruder, about 300 years earlier, she dealt with when the armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the current Betty has just been married to emperor romero and the invasion came at a very inconspicuous moment before things were completed. It will give someone a bad attitude, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Fresh, healthy, all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and secretive. Marlene Dietrich might have exceeded that, but with Betty it falls more flat than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, although Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can see in everything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this movie and This Is The Moment has an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine has one chance for Oscar glory on Buttons And Bows. <br /> <br /> Halfway through the film, Ernest Lubitsch died and Otto Preminger finished the That Lady In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch had in mind Grable. Also, you don't want to see that woman in hermine.
