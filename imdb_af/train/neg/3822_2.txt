Being a Buster Keaton fan is breaking your heart regularly. Most of us first meet Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his vast period of independent production: The General, The Navigator, Sherlock Jnr. We recognize him as the biggest figure in the entire history of movie story, and we want to see more of his movies. Here's the sadness. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr" Keaton's son-in-law, Joseph Schenck, a brother-in-law, insisted on a contract that Keaton had put under MGM control. Keaton just became one more actor to rent and perform others' scripts. Then his alcoholism became worse. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton never made a real first-class movie again. Some sources describe a masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed to be almost * at MGM: a Grand Hotel parody. Biographer Tom Dardis offered convincing evidence that Keaton made this story. <br /> <br /> The heartbeat is on the rise, as he has only gotten a good film between Keaton's long steady decline. as his short comedy 'Grand Slam Opera'. I continue to look for the lost footage of Keaton's dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in "This is a Mad Mad World": a sequence in which a bitter police call Tracy an old retired scoundrel (Keaton) and try to recruit his help to steal Smiler Grogan's cash. . These visuals are almost certainly gone forever, but I keep looking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one of Keaton's films has been his downfall since the beginning. MGM tried to build Jimmy Durante (who by chance played Smiler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM Durante was trying to build up with Keaton, whose style of comedy simply wasn't compatible with Durante's. (I'm a fan of both.) In his career Durante was a ruthless playmaker: commendable, he knew he was building at Keaton's expense, and Keaton was the only co-star Durante never tried to put up with. don't stand. <br /> <br /> Keaton is often the victim of extremely cruel machines. In 'Easy Speak' he plays a didactic and humorous Midwestern college professor named Post (because he is as wood as one) who received a letter telling him he had inherited $ 750,000. He has to travel to New York City to claim. Does he make a phone call to verify it? Does he even check the postmark? no; He took his life's savings from the bank and rushed to New York. Once he is gone, Post's servant confesses that he has written the (false) letter to abandon Professor Post from his job! <br /> <br /> Post, who thinks he's a 3/4 millionaire, cross paths with Jimmy Dodge (Durante), who is trying to produce a musical revue, but doesn't have money. The characters playing these two brilliant comedians on the screen simply fail. Keaton plays one of those eggheads (such as Mister Logic in 'Viz') that intellectually everything. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who are unable to make a straight statement, because the script requires him to always speak. There is a painful unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante tries to talk to Keaton about money, but instead of getting out of it, Durante is increasingly using confronted snake terms such as "bare", "cartwheels" and so on. while Keaton has no idea what Durante is about. I give Keaton credit: his own dry and dusty prairie voice, his flat Kansas accent, is perfect for the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, looking much slimmer and more attractive here than just a year later, is impressive as the excited director of the revue by Professor Post bankrolled (on tick). Henry Armetta, whom I have never found funny, is even less funny than usual, and offers a running gag with a stupid payment. Thelma Todd impressed me here, in a more disgusting version of the role she played in 'Horse Feathers' (a much nicer movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favorite characters, was wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with 'easy talking' is that supporting characters act in completely inappropriate ways. Keaton's attorney appears at Durante's theater with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he is not there, so the attorney will announce Keaton's personal business to the first total stranger he meets. (Fire that lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - the man seen as bankrolling these musical - blunders in the choir girls' dressing room, and all the choir girls immediately squeal and cover themselves. I know for a fact that * modern * refrain girls will never respond this way and I seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved like that ... certainly not in response to the "angel" controlling their performances. <Br /> <br /> SPOILERS COME. About half an hour into the infallible 'Speak Easy', the big Jimmy Durante puts himself on the piano, smiles in the camera and does those distinctive little shakes of his head as he starts playing a song. This is the moment I thought that this movie would eventually eventually settle for the purpose of entertaining us. Oh no. Most annoying of all is the end of this film, which uses the single most hacked and impeccable cliche in all comedy: the one in which a completely incompetent dimwit becomes its own starred by its own dissatisfaction. (Keaton would be forced to play this click again in an episode of 'Screen Directors Playhouse' in 1955. Chaplin already used it in 'The Circus'.) <br /> <br /> - in anger and sadness - at the wasted opportunity in 'Easy talking'. Mostly out of respect for the work done by Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd elsewhere, I would rate this movie 2 points out of 10. <br /> <br />
