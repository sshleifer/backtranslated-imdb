I only saw the movie when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it from our local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. However, this movie scared hell out of me. You can ask yourself, how can a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one of his followers, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and Christmas Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a devil from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch sting Santa before Christmas to catch him at Christmas when the sun rises at Christmas, because if Santa doesn't bring it home in his home, he turns to powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and pretty entertaining, but the image of demons and demons in the depths of hell dancing (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just unpleasant.
