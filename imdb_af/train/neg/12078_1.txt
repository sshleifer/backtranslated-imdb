I literally looked 3 times to watch this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare and it takes a certain attitude to be interested or not. But this movie exceeds any obstruction of long soliloquy and what doesn't, many may not just care for a Shakespeare-based story. <br /> <br /> The biggest roadblock for this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during character's interaction, it is almost difficult to distinguish whose lines are who they are. Admittedly, I believe this movie was dubbed in English. Certainly they could have acquired voice factors that could add a bit more drama to these classic literary lines. <br /> <br /> It will be difficult to evaluate this movie larger than 1, but perhaps it is based on prejudices of maybe age and which is a very low budget. Yet it is absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 10/01
