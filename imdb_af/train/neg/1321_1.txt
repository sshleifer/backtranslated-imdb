Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about 20 seconds, and what is Gene Barry across the movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! It's a movie that doesn't make sense at all. The indifferent writer / director (same man) devoured everyone's talent with his terrible uh ... work. I have the DVD for a penny so can't complain! But it's strange! And it makes you feel strange and in no good way. It was the 70's and looks as if the director was on a bad trip and wanted everyone to experience what it was like. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it plays fast dirty. It has that "Manson family on acid" site. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything they did from this movie? Maybe they worked in it when? In any case, be prepared to lose 80+ less of your life, you will never come back. Yes, it's so terrible!
