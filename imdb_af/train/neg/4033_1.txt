It hurts me to write such a review, but by not doing so, I encourage these people. First, just because a movie is made on a small budget doesn't automatically make it good or engaging. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only performance of the films, as it prevents large amounts of money from being wasted on a one-legged racehorse. Have you ever seen a comedy at the theater? Ever heard people laugh and thought, "What are the dickens on?" Well, even these twats didn't laugh. Things got so bad that my cat was his first bath. It's not movie, it's kids .... no monkeys that make images that make you feel like moving to France. I have to go, there's a clown at my door .............
