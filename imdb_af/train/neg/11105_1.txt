It didn't make sense and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has so much movie like this ... you don't have it. people cut or eat what to say ... it made me sick! oh my god! film deals with people we don't know but feed themselves with people! they have teeth blah blah blah ... isn't it known? I can bet on that, you saw it in another movie. The movie was so big, but I think the scenario was really awful. and I have to say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely fantastic ... he is so talented ... actually I said terribly, but I think this is because of terrible scenes ... let me explain. Have you ever eaten tongue? but in the movie one person did it! it was really awful ... anyway, I think movie would be so good without that terrible human eater or cutter ...
