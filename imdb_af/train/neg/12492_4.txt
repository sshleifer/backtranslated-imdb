It's one of those movies that has an amazing video box, but has comrade work and unfamiliar actors talking with a bad dialogue. It's so dark when the murder happens, you can barely see it, and the movie is hard to understand. The only star in it is WCW's Vanessa Sanchez (WCW's before being folded) and she's a good actress. I like a low budget movie special that has bugs because they are fun to watch, but carelessly it's not one of them. This movie is good to see if you like voodoo and cut heads, but it's not a mistake, but if you need something new to watch and rent.
