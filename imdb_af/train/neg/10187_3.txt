Dumb, incessant drive over a plane mounted within hours by airplane that has never worked on planes (managed by Burgess Meredith), which drives a Porsche racing car run on dozens of old petrol sludges, led by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno -Wiz who can put McGyver into a radio receiver that picks up all the frequencies at once, and who has somehow learned how to get and use chemicals for high explosives. to make a completely peaceful society. Like moronies as it sounds. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that it was just his second film.
