I'm on the record as the second person who has been watching the IMDb movies for years, is motivated by Nacho's film The Abandoned to create an account and comment. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "puzzle pieces" added in any way. The acting was laughing and the writing was embarrassing. How this movie came and went was completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f-word. (and brilliant sound design) If I am confronted with the option of seeing this movie again or being ground by wild drills, I will be at a difficult decision. I'm disappointed I can't give 0 stars.
