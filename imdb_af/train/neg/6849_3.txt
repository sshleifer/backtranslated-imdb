This quasi-J horror movie followed a young woman when she returned to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family home and meet with old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, had drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another youth friend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back with black magic. The ties between the dead and the living are already weak and the friends and residents see ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike star J-horror movies, the tension isn't really built, the result doesn't seem to be threatened and the end falls on the absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie is like plain white rice, also a little cooked. long so that it borders on the mushy. Sometimes you get it at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating it because you need it with the meal because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it wastes the meal almost because of the clumsy, throbbing tastelessness of everything. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
