Man, it was hilarious. It must be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. This would have made it clear how a stack of stench was much easier. Seriously? I want someone who is tagged with this movie to be effective immediately. For anyone thinking of watching this movie, we will exceed some plot points. No wait. There is no. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to film something with a random one, and miraculously it somehow got video tape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Don't believe me? Go see it. Do this, man. I challenge you. But be prepared to throw your eyes out. If you can sit through it without blowing a cow, you are very strong and brave.
