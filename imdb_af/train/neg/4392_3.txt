A young scientist is trying to repair his dead father's work on the limb. His excessive mother convinced him that he had killed his own father and monitored his progress for her own evil purposes. " A young doctor uses reptile DNA from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently pulled off a few minutes later, he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm. The special effects in "Severed Ties" are pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is horrible. The cut arm was worn like a snake and killed few people. Great action. The play is mediocre and the climax is stupid3 out of 10.
