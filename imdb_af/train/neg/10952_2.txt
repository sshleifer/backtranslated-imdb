I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know they're going for realism, but to be honest, I don't want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see daily life, I'll live your life. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can handle the low production values, hell I am a sucker for low production values, but at least work in good ideas. The direction goes just as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit, but of course it's supposed to dig it because it makes things so much more realistic. Hitchcock said drama was essentially alive with the dim pieces cut out. I can only deduce it is not drama, not a long shot. We see Rosetta walk to a place, Rosetta works in a bakery, Rosetta eats a waffle, Rosetta wears bags far, Rosetta walks back home, Rosetta walks somewhere ... it's just not so entertaining. There is also no deeper meaning. I got so bored that I started looking at some reflections on life in this movie, but it's just ordinary realism, the most overestimated quality in the business. I think I should love it, but come on, there is nothing there.
