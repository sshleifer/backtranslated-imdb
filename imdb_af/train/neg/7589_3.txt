What do you expect if there is no writing, and therefore nothing that the director can work on. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they have nothing to say or something to respond to. Even the earthquake was pretty poor. And I don't know how close the movie is to the novel, but two turned up the Jewish girl from nowhere, just like Arturo has a nice heart, but some stereotypes are nothing. And he even buried Camilla in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic funeral where he could bring his flowers at least once. Pathetic. And the L.A. set was ridiculously created graphically. Anything good? The window to his apartment really feels, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always wonderful. Ever since the Body Snatchers of Night of the Living Dead, whatever it was.
