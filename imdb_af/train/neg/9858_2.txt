This movie is not funny. It only captures the D&D nerds and strengthens them. All the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially delayed, and they have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unattractive, like two of the gamers who are beaten by a black midweek, because one of them had a KKK cap (that was his wizard costume) and the other one warmed on a John Rocker how funny he is a nerd so he doesn't know about sport). You might need to be a childish high school to find any of these things funny. Poorly shaped mocks are so painful to look at, but of course very cheap to make. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think these are the only opportunities for hotties beyond their prime.
