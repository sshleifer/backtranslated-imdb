In this movie, Chávez supporters (either Venezuela or non-Venezuela) are just about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez announcement that shot many PDVSA best workers just for political issues. <br /> <br /> They said nothing of 96 TVs. interruptions by Chávez in 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscation or private TV signals). Each one lasts about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They didn't tell us anything. The prominent announcement by General and Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, military force inspector general, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. . Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Ministro de Interior and Justicia. After Chavez's return, he owned the cost of Ministro del Defensa (equal to US Defense Secretary). <br /> <br /> They said nothing about Chávez's orders to shoot at a pacifical people concentration claiming to have chosen. <br /> <br /> They said nothing about the people in this concentration murdered by Chávez supporters (civilians and military officials). <br /> <br /> In a wrong order, they present some facts to lie. <br /> <br /> They didn't say anything about Venezuelan civil society. They are now even demanding an election to resolve the crisis and Chavez action to avoid the elections. <br /> <br /> So I tell you .... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.
