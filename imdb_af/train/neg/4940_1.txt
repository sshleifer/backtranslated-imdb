This show was a 30 minute waste of valuable DVR hard drive space. I didn't expect much and I actually received less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode. I can't believe Geico will ever use the cavemen advertising campaign again. I would have preferred to spend a night looking at my daughter's hair for head lice than watching this piece of garbage. I wonder what ABC has managed to make this show fit into the '07 fall schedule, perhaps a hospital / crime / documentary reality program with the AFLAC duck? If I didn't express my opinion on this show, let me be clear and say it's not too good.
