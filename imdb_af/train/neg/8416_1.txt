It seems to me that this movie is raves of Hollywood, as it is often a popular competition in Hollywood. It also makes sense if you think that people who like the movie just respond to the many songs spoken to you rather than story content. Yet this film is overestimated and overwhelmed. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. In no way does Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar-rated performance, so much they surprised before the movie was even out. I can't even believe Condon is set up to be nominated for an Oscar director. All he did was create an album. Glitz does not replace a story. A lot of songs don't make a movie.
