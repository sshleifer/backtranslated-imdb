I watched this movie on March 21 this year. But say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". Plot is hackneyed. Tell about Prabhat living with his father, wife, and little brother. The movie opens when he stores a bride. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother. He makes a plan by sending a few men. They come to a school as if they were Prabhats friends. Get that kid. His dad threw him out of the house. Then he comes back later. He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. Sunny gives a good performance, Chunky was at its best annoying. Afterward is messed up. Divya did well, Sonam was wasted. Jyotsna was wasted but looked cute. The child who was Sunny's brother in the movie was cute. He was cute. He had to kill his character. The girl was cute but was annoying. The other child did well. It did well. Kiran was sufficient. Amrish and Gulshan did well. The cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya.Script is poor but has some good dialogues. Also drag. The movie. The music was good. I just liked one song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics of that song were good. The other songs were forgotten. Don't look at it. Rating-10/03
