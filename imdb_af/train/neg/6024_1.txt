I watched this movie about 30 minutes before finally getting sick with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called plot, and every actor. It's like they all think they are the lead of the movie and scream "KNOWLEDGE ME!" over and over. The bad guy has his bad guy music going and says sinister bad guys-like things, just if you don't really catch them. The good guy does brave and noble things only if you didn't know he was the good guy. And o lord, the plane scene. "MY HOUSEHOLD IS MISSING! OH MY GOD! It is impossible for him to cut his legs or go to the toilet or anything, he must miss!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and began to panic before she even had time to look at the damn chair he was in.) <br /> <br / > As a religious girl, I apologize to the world for wasting the movie it was printed on. <br /> <br /> And I want me back 30 minutes.
