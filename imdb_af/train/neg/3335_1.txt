This Cannon Movie Languages ​​is the worst of the lot and is a positive proof that a five-minute fable doesn't make a full movie. Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor is made to look so silly, it's hard to look at him. As the smart carpenter, Robert Morse doesn't have our charm. Not his unfortunate cousin (Jason Carter). The "songs" are terrible and just slow down from the plot. The direction is virtually non-existent, and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is beautiful as the emperor's daughter, but her voice is of course dubbed for some reason, a lot shared by many minors. And the movie crawls on a snail's pace. Hans Christian Andersen had to be somersaults in his grave when it appeared. It can honestly be said, at least from this film story, it's no surprise that it went straight to the oblivion of the video.
