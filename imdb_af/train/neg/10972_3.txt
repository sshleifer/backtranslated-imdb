It wasn't a Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. It was a great wannabee. It wanted to be an edgy, nervous laugh, an affirmative movie in urban life, but it is more of a camera that is rough, messy. It's much easier to simulate something else than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning I couldn't care more about the characters or what they were involved with. They always always hit each other, piss or cry. First, there was nothing they did. The dialogue between characters is meant to be hip, revealing, but instead it comes out, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers out there who really like this movie, so I can be wrong.
