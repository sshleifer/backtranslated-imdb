This film is told by a young teacher at a Catholic school and sees the RAWANDAN genocide impossible around him. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a brief explanation on the history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told by the eyes of a young, idealistic "NEW-COMER", a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road block, he plays with his drivers I.D. Not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver cannot identify himself as the right tribe for the soldiers, they will be killed. And that's how he deals with the unfolding story of chaos and unfolds around him. Suddenly realize that every Rawandan (including his manager) is involved and that Europeans cannot and will not help soldiers and tourists. The media cameras can't stop machete's, and there are too many armed militia men to shoot. The title comes from the captain of the armies and says he will shoot the dogs eating the bodies around his compound but will not shoot the Militia men who kill people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally, he realized the hopelessness of the situation and the man who told the evacuation team that he wanted to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, fled with his tail between his legs, rather than seeing the immanent death with the schoolchildren. He was promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> It's more of character study, and a moment for Jesus for one character, as a story about genocide in "RAWANDA". This movie should not be in RAWANDA. It could have happened to any of the genocidal heroes that occurred at any given time around this world.
