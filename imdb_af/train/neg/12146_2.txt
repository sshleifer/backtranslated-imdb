This apocalyptic zombie film is trying to be dirty and shocking; but the feeding of the masses comes off as some of the stiff-legged zombies bump the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic is known as the Lazarus virus played by government manipulated newspapers and television stations. A few brave, but stupid, souls at Channel 5 TV News feel that his audience is being given false hope and no idea of ​​the real danger at hand. An avid reporter (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), insult life and limbs to offer a live broadcast to the doom before the to show. Do yourself a favor and do not look. This thing, of course, is very low budget and comes over with the feeling of a bad school game. Acting is horrible and the meat hungry zombies are almost comical. Also appearing: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. Feeding the masses should be left to starve.
