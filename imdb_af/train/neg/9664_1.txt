This book-based movie is really awful and a great disappointment. We've been waiting for this move for more than a month. Many film reviewer was hopeful for that. It also made great sense in newspapers and TV. When April 29th, many regrets that the movie is really awful. Why? First of all, it was so monotonous. There are many indefinite scenes, sometimes it is difficult to understand what is going on. The actresses, from Hulya Avsar, were not harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She performs better in comedy films. In this movie, a kind of drama, she couldn't finish her previous role. And finally Film is too short, just 66 minutes.
