"Black Angel" is a small misconduct, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after being convicted of killing an old expert. Dan Duryea (the murdered woman's husband) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has a grateful role as a suspect. This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, who never reaches anything special. It's nice enough, but then it stops at some point and the solution to the mystery causes one of those big "give me a break" reaction. That which ends up alone could have completely sunk the movie, but what precedes the conclusion is also not very good. Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing good guys. I love movie noirs, but this one was a real disappointment.
