This film has all the hallmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stove. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems that the powers that are not enough alone can be. They could not decide whether it would be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and also how much they should step down whose story it seems to be. Such a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and infamous (Ms Graham) personalities becomes an urgent, unheard-of soap opera, about which we also have little to say. In addition, there is absolutely no other time than in 1959. Clumsy play follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is over. But - and this saved me the movie - Kerr has never looked more beautiful, and Peck is always a very handsome man. They really make a beautiful, mature couple, and I just wish they had better material to work with. There is one scene that works. Scott goes to Shielah while he's drunk, and to see these two normally sophisticated stars beating each other is very disturbing and gives a bit of a brief idea of ​​what happens in a relationship like that. Unlike this, the film is a wasted opportunity and nowhere near the classic stature of other Wald-produced 1950s soaps. (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING).
