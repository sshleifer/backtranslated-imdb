Although I have looked at this piece with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a fairly uncompromising composer whose lack of talent is only exceeded by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> It was the first cartoon movie I saw that was 100 percent humor free. It is rude, offensive, redneck and blatantly anti-women. As such, it is a creation that satisfies Bohlen, but the average viewer will rather be slipped through it. No wonder it has never been shown in a theater theater: it would have bombed BIG time! <br /> <br /> Even the cost of 6.5 MegaEuros was able to save this whole piece of crap. Save your time ... and money!
