Not a woman movie, but movie for the gang. One of the worst movies ever made by a male director on women. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman. Peaks of bad taste, American Pie's humor style, rude story, no sense, landless story, characters refused. Vulgar fantasies appeared on the screen. Offensive and certainly not funny. I wonder how three good actresses accepted to participate.
