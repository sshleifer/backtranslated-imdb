I expected the different Sci-fi and thriller movies this summer, but was so disappointed with this particular movie. While some people walked out of the movie, I decided to stay, just to play with the other filmmakers on the scene, a lack of tension, ridiculous end and difficult storyline. I almost confused myself as the main character in the film. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the soundtrack. This is one of those emerging star films that they later regret. In retrospect I wouldn't even rent this one, let alone pay over $ 5 to see.
