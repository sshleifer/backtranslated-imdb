0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The acting is one of the worst I have ever seen. What is really great is that everyone is terrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly clear, the score is terrible, I don't want to say the movie has been edited, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase. It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. It's not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. legally bad throughout. The writing was terribly bad. The cinematography is really cheap, and sometimes very grainy, and the camera work is terrible. Again, what really is the movie is how bad all the actors are. Wink.
