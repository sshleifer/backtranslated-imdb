I like a movie that has at least a story of a story. It doesn't occur in this movie. It is a series of vignettes without conspiracy. <br /> <br /> There are scenes from a person who collects pineapple cans. A woman with a blonde wig never removes her sunglasses. This woman shoots at the start of the movie with other people and we never find out why. She disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another cocky woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' are overwhelmed (I prefer the song). The dialogue is mostly concerned with food (pineapples, chef's salad and ordering of drinks?). I suppose most of the actors gained weight during this movie, because many fast food were consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. It is allegedly a romance - it's not like that. I just wonder why I didn't hit the Fast-forward. I kept waiting for something significant to happen ?? Don't do it. Perhaps this is the only consolation for these films - screens have shifted so quickly that it has deceived you into assuming there would be a revelation for all the nonsense.
