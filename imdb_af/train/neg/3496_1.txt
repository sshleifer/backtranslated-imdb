I remember my parents couldn't understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also didn't understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember and understand many of the things my children love. But it's pathetic. I can't say I've seen any of Sarah, except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I don't see her as something special. But this show is just as far below what I expected from her. The IMDb entry made it sound like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I sat it halfway through. Anything else is better. Jokes intended for a 5-year-old being offered on an allegedly adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult has since moved to shut you down. I can't believe anyone actually financed this comedy insult. Only good thing I can say is that there are so many guys being deposited here, and other programs are saved from such an embarrassment.
