Marlon Brando has long lost interest in acting when making this film. His performance as "The Sweden" is the worst of his career, and that is exactly what he meant to be. He does not persuade. Instead, he simply does a bizarre way and picks up fun on his embarrassing gigantic outline. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst, funniest moment in the history of the theater. As we testify, he mainly falls into a toilet, it's hard to believe we are watching the same actor standing in a street cart called Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I think The real question is why Marlon behaved in his later years. Was he sick of the movie business? Did he just make himself a complete and total fool? I think we will never know. But this film serves as a fascinating study of how bad acting is all about. <br /> <br /> On this note, watching fellow acting veteran Donald Sutherland struggling to deliver his lines, embarrassed himself because he agreed to take part in this travesty.
