I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years or so) and then kept it. I remember this the other day and decided to look it up again. The second time it wasn't nice. The play is "so," the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> The acting ... I'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. The plot ... there is no way in hell that would have been the women with the first robbery, much less the 2nd. (Lace: Why didn't TT realize that even if she had a load of money for her court date, they would ask where she got it and she didn't have a logical answer! Thing, Ding ... we have a rogue !). It is terribly stereotypical black women to say basically that the only way black women can defeat the system or get a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. It plays too much on sympathy b / c all die in the end (bar Jada), but it's not sad (you think, "They were so stupid, they deserve to die.) You just don't care for the characters, unless you are a shallow person. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie prizes over a 5.
