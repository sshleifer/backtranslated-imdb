It's probably the most boring movie in history. I really look forward to seeing this movie as actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see the Three Amigos as ever watching this movie again. It immediately went straight from the DVD player into the garbage. My apology for those of you who seem to like this movie, but you probably also loved New Coke. I have a loss to see why someone would enjoy this movie, it's slow, boring and has no real plot. You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand it was made in 1976, but it was an era of bad television everywhere. Thanks God disco and Three's Company are with stop sign glasses and the Bay City Rollers. Oh, just my mind.
