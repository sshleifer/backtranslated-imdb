I wrote at least half a dozen reviews of this tiny little movie and no one is published, so I have to remember that someone at imdb.com likes much of this horrible movie. The idea that a lot of oilmates can erect a military tank that has arrived in the desert for more than a decade and makes a roadmap is ridiculous. So is the acting and direction. Go over it.
