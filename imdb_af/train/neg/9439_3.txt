Twist endings can be really cool in a movie. It's especially interesting if the turn is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. That type of turnaround is the one that reminds people. Then we have a twist like this movie. Turn it, whether you pay attention or not, you have no idea what will happen. When they reveal this kind of random turn, rather than shock, it's a dumbfounded reaction. This movie starts as if it is an interesting horrible act, but after about 20 minutes it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert so they get away through the forest and hit a tree trunk. They end up at an old, old, dull lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her domestic daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange things are going to happen, as these girls stay at this house for a few days, instead of going or going home, and the tensions are getting stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie was encountered in the dialogue, and it is always between only a few characters. We have the main three girls, the creepy spider and the old lady, and the conversation of any interest goes no further than this five. To make matters worse, they never have anything to say. It is actually very angry to sit through their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing). <br /> <br /> Plotgate is plentiful here. The house these girls stay when they come in their car accident is apparently three kilometers from anywhere ... wow, three miles! A two hour or less walk will kill them. Why didn't they come and work with the worker for this household-driven household? Did he have one seat? How do these girls never get out and just stay willing, rarely even notice each other? Why did it have so many stupid bounces? Perhaps the answers are in boring writing. <br /> <br /> Having a slasher movie with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the end is definitely out there, but undoubtedly stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 from ****. 79 minutes. R for nudity and violence.
