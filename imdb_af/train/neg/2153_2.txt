The 3-D appears in "The Man Who Was Not There" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This indecent comedy has bad 3-D effects that better compare the 3-D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3". Not to mention the movie is to the limit. It was one of many 1983 movies that have the pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got caught up in this mess, but at least they didn't kill their careers. Tambor will die on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's boxing hit "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg followed this flop with the "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". Put them in those projects instead of them here in "The Man Who Wasn't There". If you do, you'll regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
