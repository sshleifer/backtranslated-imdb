I don't really comment but wanted to make sure people of this movie are being warned. This is an unfinished student movie with no standalone features whatsoever. On a technical level, it is totally amateur - constantly unintentional jump changes within scenes, dual copying, etc. The plot is completely clicked, the structure is playable and the play is embarrassing. I don't want to be too hard: I've made myself part of student videos, and they were all terrible, but there's no reason for this movie to be in the world where innocent fans should see it. /> Safe assumption that - much like the throw - positive comments are film makers, friends and family.
