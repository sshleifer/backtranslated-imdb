Bad plot (albeit good for a B-movie), good fast-paced scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But something always bothered me about this movie: how did Mariska Hargitay never occur? In the TV show she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. But in the usual (video) version most of her scenes are cut and she doesn't speak at all. It bothers me because it is not just a female (though cloned) viewpoint of the film, but it also makes the final shot look awkward. This movie would have been better if she kept her plays, because in those scenes she has at least a personality, one that undermines Speakman's say.
