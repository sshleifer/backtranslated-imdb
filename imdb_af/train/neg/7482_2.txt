So this movie is not funny - such a waste of big stars, which seems to have been caught up in their own deaths for forgetting them. Only bright moments belong to John Cleese as a hotel manager who likes to dress up. You almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter as he dances for Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while wearing high heels, a mini jacket and a beautiful hat. The rest: forget it!
