There was nothing about this movie I wanted. It was such a low budget with poor lighting and camera work (almost like Blair Witch Project, just that wasn't so supposed to be so). There was not much on the plot, and the movie just drug on and off. I actually sent the last 1/3 of the movies fast, but it didn't help much. It may look good from the box, but I have to say again: nothing about this movie looks good. No good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was awful, and the dialogue was painfully awful. On my own personal scale I give this movie a 0 out of 10. Yikes!
