It was at my friend's camp wagon last night at 9:30 am and we were so excited to see South Park (a new episode). The thing is in South Africa at 10:30, and in South Africa we are airing and we have decided to kill time by watching the performance, Father of Pride, now busy. I will first say that I just looked at episodes. The first time I watched it, I didn't get anything, and I thought, "Holy sh * t, I have a soccer game tomorrow, so I have to stop watching silly cartoons. "But yesterday I tried to give the Father of Pride a second chance. I find it a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, but rather replace yellow human characters with lions. <br /> <br /> The second thing I'm wondering is why it got its TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons very vulgar, and the only true vulgarity in this show is some homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and rude. I also heard that the creator of the series also aimed Shrek 2. Well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he stayed too much in the thematic family. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride made me smile three times or three times (even burst out once). <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't care, Father of Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. I saw better of "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
