This is Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is occupied by terrorists and it's up to one cop, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop it. <br /> <br /> A B Action movie that borrows from other movies and is pretty good. with good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as policeman and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like silly B-action movies, it's not for you.
