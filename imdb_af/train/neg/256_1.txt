What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny? Does he really think he's funny? Well, it's funny to be confident in it. The man has no identity. I mean you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he is really trying to imitate them in most of his movies. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly and what comes out is some parts where he looks a bit like Denzel, with those machos ** t attitude and then suddenly goes to Martin Lawrence, the funny and stupid comic. There is no personal touch for everything. I mean he doesn't contribute to the personality he's trying to sell, and I'm sure he doesn't have anything to say personally. He is really Mr Dull-boy in person. <br /> <br /> I really hope Hollywood and the black community in America will find someone better off in superstars, such as Don Cheadle, for example, but perhaps the Pathetic Jamie better represents the generation remixing the parent.
