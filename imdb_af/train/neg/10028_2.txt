I have many expectations of this movie and more, as it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two are in love and decide to run away, but Pooja tells Jimmy she can't do it because she owes debt to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and it is only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji has hired a man, Bachchan Pandey, to find Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> With Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the movie director is Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" should be one of the worse movies I've ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much-known weight loss) looks good. But plot is very thin on story and sometimes makes no sense from one scene to another - hence why I said from the outset that I expected more from this movie, as it was a Yashraj production. With reference to songs, unfortunately, not one song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are moments where one can laugh and it is mainly due to Akshaye Kumar and Saif certainly did better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well. But that can't be said for Anil Kapoor. It didn't change him at all as a villain. Lastly, watch out for Aditya Chopra, who has produced and directed good movies like "Mohabbatein" in the past, what did Yash Chopra do by producing such a garbage film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, it's not worth wasting your time, and that's my first and last impression.
