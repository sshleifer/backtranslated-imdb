*** WARNING! SPOILERS IN HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what would happen to Madonna if she were ever stranded on a deserted island. There is absolutely no challenge for Madonna in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna Madonna, and she can't even get it right. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know this is where Madonna really likes, you never met her!" Right, I didn't, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", not us? I know Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> In the year 2002 you will think that Madonna might have learned something or somehow from the "crossover" ladies who are also on the silver screen. For the sake of good, Madonna didn't see Glitter? Mariah Carey showed the film world how it was done !!! Mariah kicks Madonna's trashy butt to the brink of beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, call it! All we see from this look in Madonna's world is that she is the only one. <br /> <br /> If there's one thing that should be said for Madonna, it's that she's consistent. When she was an MTV treasure, she held back the world of women's fashion for 20 years. Now, in film, she used to play female roles in film and society for 20 years. By glorifying all the most hated, abominable, reprehensible and ominous attributes, women are allegedly locked up in them, qualities they so desperately tried to prove that they really did not possess. <br /> <br /> *** HERE IS THE SPOILERS !!! Don't continue reading if you don't want to ... *** <br /> Here's the one good thing I will say about this movie, and I was really impressed. They didn't go for the "Hollywood Ending" - Madonna's character lives. In the typical, happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character died on the island and her long-suffering, repressed, whipped man would be free to eventually settle with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be exactly the opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this very depressing conclusion she is saved, and again this poor victim of a man is again anointed with his devil of a woman, and his life will again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** BACK THE SPOILERS ***
