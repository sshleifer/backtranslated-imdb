There are a few movies you just know they will be out of frame one. Even if you were completely unaware of Ed Wood's work, you look at the commentator of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and you only know you're not going to see the next cinematic masterpiece. Likewise, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Boll's masterpiece "House of Dead", with the guy sitting in front of the house, starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just came from Sin City , I knew I was in for a helluva ride. <br /> <br /> So, the movie starts like this - first the main character says that everyone else will die. You know, to make you go astray. Then he launches the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma .. think she's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia .. my ex. We've just emerged. I had to study and she had to make fence." No, I'm not joking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these little 20-somethings that couldn't get out of a wet paper bag go to the "Rave of the Century" In the question are a few tents, a harbor a-potjie and a villainous stage on a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately we found a way to get there, such as a fishing boat run by Kirk. (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, who wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick is a bastard. child of Simpsons Cpt McAllister and that hooker who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> To shorten the long story, the gang comes to the island, no one finds there except a few bloody T-shirts and then decides to run the hell out of there. Don't wait, they don't, they're actually all happy and like food, there's free liquor. <br /> <br /> With that scene, the movie rocks and then it goes all the way to go further down. Some guys in rubber suits are starting to run around, screaming and shooting, our gang goes to a house to meet another gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and a policewoman (who between them has about 500 pounds) arms) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they change to a S.W.A. team, enter the matrix, the rubber packs start to multiply parents like bacteria and I start crying because I actually paid to see it. To give insult to the injury, there are shots from the video game every few minutes based on this crap and there is a cute game-over cut scene for a few characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie seriously. It doesn't even fit in the well-known "So bad it's good" category. It's just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, actors are bad. The list just goes on. <br /> <br /> You'll probably want to see this movie just because it's reputation to be terrible. Don't do it. There are bad movies that are earned to be watched. This is not one of them.
