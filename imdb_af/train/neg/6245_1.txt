The only thing that proves an awkward truth is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "undisputed" experts are indisputable because a reaction to their improper hypotheses is generally under the right science. These are mostly false scientists. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - is people, we take it out and unless you're willing to sacrifice your brothers to save the world, there's no darn thing to do. We have heard how the world would end up for more than 50 years because of man. Foolish publishes a timeline for their doomsday and when time passes, nothing has happened. "An uncomfortable truth" is just another vehicle with which a dishonest faction of American society can tackle their jaws. <br /> <br /> And if All leaves the tobacco business because of its sister's cancer death, it's a burden too. Although his farm couldn't manage better than he could manage the country. He lost money on the operation because he didn't mind farming when he could make more money on talking tours. The only global warming that is unobstructed is the hot air produced by this gas bag!
