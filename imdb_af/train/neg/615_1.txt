I have to say, I usually like horror movies I've never seen ... but this one was just too pathetic for my gory taste. I'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types ... but this particular movie was lame. The acting was terrible (yet the crowny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). And the sequel, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a big rave about it and people kept it. But when Emily Rose's movies like The Ring and The Exorcist come out, movies like this make movies like scarecrow look childish. If you want a movie to just pass the time, choose this one! The special effects are cute. But since it is a low budget film, I would love to see where it comes in. It will remind you of the movie "Children Of The Corn." Independent movies rock .... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with maize goats, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows go to it, then these movies will be for you.
