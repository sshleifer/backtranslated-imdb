Elephant Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in concept, it actually failed. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A big problem with them, however, is the great abundance of light blooms. It's terrible, but I think it helps to give the movie a dream quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is the terrible voice work. While Proog's voting factor is at least semi-skilled, Emo's voting factor is UNDERSTANDED. I think if you have a budget that is actually zero, you can't afford to rent real voting factors. To me, they seem to have hired one of the animators to do his voice. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie doesn't really go. For me, it looks more of a "look we can do" kind of a movie rather than a real movie. The plot goes nowhere and fails to really point an interesting point. The whole movie feels that it has been made an excuse to make interesting areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, this may be a quick download from the official site, but don't expect anything except nice graphics.
