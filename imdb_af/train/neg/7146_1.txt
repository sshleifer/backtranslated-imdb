I just registered to make this comment (which is actually some of the one here already echoes). The acting is worse than sub-paragraph, it is set out on well-known stereotypes, has some of the worst exhibits of tasteless female objectifications (all bids no brains). and has some of the baldest lines known to man. <br /> <br /> including but not limited to "everything can see what these guys can do". I must also mention that when they show the accidents with innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and starting to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black men who just rub people in the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this movie does not allow for that kind of character exploration. You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of catching the audience. <br /> <br /> Even the cars can't make this movie a movie. That Enzo that Griffin wrecked this movie perfectly. It just sucks.
