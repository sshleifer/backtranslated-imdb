What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While she was out". I try to decide which one is weaker in terms of pain while I watch. I believed, "While she was out," was worse. <br /> <br /> It has already been said in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical etc. The only thing I really need to add is that at some point I felt more for the evil guys than for the woman because I would recommend her for a Darwin award if she actually died (only the first half looked, so I don't know). Soon I was at two Darwin Awards (if even possible) for her tremendous stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she didn't just get the script, but was also responsible for wasting money on us, the people? I see people wasting considerable amounts of money because the money could be used to feed and occupy quite a few people instead of 80 percent of those who saw it in the theater and 20 percent, who are idiotic, " a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are.
