I only gave this movie a single star because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism. In their laboratory (a run-off warehouse in L.A.), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the rest of the movie is an endless foot hunt. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (a rubber puppet) is released and begins to erase the throw. It has the wonderful ability to sneak within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then quickly biting their heads off. <br /> <br /> One cast member escapes into a police car and spends the rest of the movie purposefully driving through the city. She has such a better spiritual ability that she can't even serve the radio. She never makes an effort to drive to a substation or a donut shop and looks hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> The T-Rex is ravaged by the whole city, there is blazing gunfire and buildings (cardboard mock-ups) inflated, but a single police car, or the army, or anyone else comes up. Such activities should be commonplace in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a successor is not planned.
