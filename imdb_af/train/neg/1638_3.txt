I am looking forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after having rented the entire nine years. He was worth the rent, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I remember that the trailer for "Whipped" was a bit funny and the plot about three over-exexed New Yorker twenty somethings all fell and manipulated by the beautiful Peet was worth a shot. So, one afternoon, I convinced two friends to see this movie with me. This review is fine. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have the three main buttons, which tell their conquests in a dinner. What should be funny, or at least tell, is rather pathetic. Was there a redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to come from? <br /> <br /> [And while I don't care about films that are vulgar fun, I wonder why no one in the dinner turned around when the studs talk aloud about sexual and cataloging details. They do it every week at the same dinner? You will think someone will complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other diners brand on one scene. But it's just a set up for a punchline. Everybody else in the dinner is deaf.] <br /> <br /> The second act has fallen all three studs to Mia and then develops brain root, fails to ask each other or her about what really happens between the four of them. And I asked myself, as the studs are still acting as they were, what redeeming qualities do they see in them to keep them longer than one date? Does she start with brain rot? I was hoping for Eric's character, the married partner, to become something more than just the annoying punching bag in this act. His role is clear to give advice to be married. But why do they even have to talk to him when they won't talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third law decides which plot is there, but by now I watched my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something really funny to happen and I had to agree. The scene that explained everything was adequate and managed to explain all the questions and mysterious dialogues throughout the film, but we just checked them out of a list. ("Oh, okay, that's why Brad did it and Jonathan says it and ...") <br /> <br /> What we laughed about was the stupidity of the plot rather than anything amusing. Even the issues during the credits were not very funny. Eventually I left nothing except a desire to warn people of this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
