I get the feeling that the producers of this mess were to ever make the painful, ridiculous Western one. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, you have beautiful color photography and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted well enough in an annoying role, so frighteningly written that no actor could give a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were pretty good, which just printed the horrible story and script. <br /> <br /> Things I Hated: Stewart Granger looks as little as a western figure, with his British accent, neatly fitted outfit, and stupid, impeccable, ever-white tapered tie tied around his neck . It became tiresome as the townspeople and his son had hungry and insulting Granger, and he never spoke or replied. I know we're supposed to suspend unbelief and appreciate Western as symbolic moral plays, but this one has broken the game with nice unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst being at the end where Granger miraculously, quickly and single-handedly plants dynamite around a canyon passes the bad man's cattle, and then Granger settles in the perfect spot so that he can shoot the dynamite from afar to create rock slides and bury the cattle and bad guys, who seem to destroy them, except the two major bad guys. Next worst is everything about the plot, which is loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the movie was credible: I couldn't believe what all the conflict is about. The bad man chased his herd to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way; I don't see why something couldn't be worked out. You need a land ownership dispute for this? Don't bother to see it.
