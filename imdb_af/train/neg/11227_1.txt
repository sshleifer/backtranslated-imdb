This movie was out of faith. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before it started, the owner of the theater rose and told us how half of the audience left the theater the night before, which became its "world premiere". I don't think anyone in the theater understood how bad the movie would be at that time. We all understood at the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a documentary, though it's sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and misleading tribute to Bettie Paige, in which half the movie is just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is subpar to say the least. A scenario will start, then someone will say, "Wow, you're so nice Bettie, why don't we make another movie." This will be followed by a 5 minute of a Bettie Paige remake that was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring) the normal part of the movie. By the end of the movie, people laughed every time another Bettie Paige turned up film recovery. it was so ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in the theater, but people didn't laugh at the filmmaker, they laughed at the movie and its poor content and structure. It was easy to tell if the parts that would get the most were those that were supposed to be serious or revealing. <br /> <br /> I know movies are expensive. I've seen a lot of cheap independent movies, but somehow the movies and the quality of this movie have been apart from anything I've ever seen. The movie looks like it's made for $ 12. The cuts, the grain force and the lack of a sensual plot made it an unforgettable experience. This movie makes 'Dude, Where's my car?' Looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I felt the theater as we paid just $ 8 to be tortured. The only saving part of the experience was that we had to laugh at the fact that someone made this movie and thought it well. Apparently, the night before, the night of the world was the premiere, the director / writer / producer in the audience and they saw people laughing and walking on his movie. Bettie Paige's movies were destroyed. They must also destroy this film.
