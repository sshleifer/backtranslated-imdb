I really wanted to keep this western, a fan of the genre and a fan of Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane, who are all in this story! Add Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded good. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it wasn't. I looked at my watch, just 40 minutes in it, to get bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just didn't look like "Buffalo Bill." Cooper was not at its best, or sounding. It was a few years before he hit his head as an actor. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, its western shot spaces. Keep the pace up and watch another otter, because most of them were much better than that.
