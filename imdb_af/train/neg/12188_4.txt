While I can't deny that his movies are often entertaining, I always felt that Martin Scorsese was just a little overestimated in his abilities. His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream. "Look at me, aren't I an imaginative director?" His best movie I've seen is the one with the least added flourish, the superior "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> For this repetition, however, it always seems to be business as usual. The dull movie stock to persuade a 1950s institution was so dirty that it was a distraction in itself. The melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic "Psycho" count are more likely to cause suppression of mockery than a feeling of atmospheric terror. The score for "Psycho" was brilliantly relentless, this homage sounds just shrill and annoying. Even the cast, which can sometimes be decent, produces histrionic performances that just shout 'caricature'; The notable exception to this is an intelligent twist by Lewis as the impressive teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure, he looks pretty threatening, but as soon as he opens his mouth, the aura just goes away. Now I'm not an expert on American accent, I originally came from near Manchester in England, but surely he could come with a more convincing southern drawl than that? If he is the gifted physical actor, he is almost the deadly mistake, but not quite. It was unhappy for me, as a De Niro fan, to wish he was out of sight, rather than on his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) <br /> <br /> The ear The top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculous remaining final. When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as the viewer gives a visual and sonic bombing? I also thought he was a reputation respected to use the "murder-yet-good" cheap trick that fewer talented individuals employ. <br /> <br /> All in all, a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller'. Scorsese and De Niro worked much better together.
