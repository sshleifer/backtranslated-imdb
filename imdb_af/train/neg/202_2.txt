This is not the sound of the bees, this is the result of watching this extremely long, extremely boring, poorly activated movie. How I ever did it by 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep, I will never know. The plot is simple ... 3 thorough unlikely morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. It's even worse if it's possible. > I really should be a masochist if I could watch this whole movie without switching it off ... or killing someone.
