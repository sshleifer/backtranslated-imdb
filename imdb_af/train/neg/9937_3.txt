First, it is a very dated film, not focused on the left wing's political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is quite stupid, since the answer is made to be exactly intellectual), it reduces me to despair; as if we should all return to monkeys in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous. Our intellectuality is just one of many human traits, but that does not mean that we should not give up as much as possible. But undoubtedly this non-educational message is linked to Godard's use of rock music; hence the Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the devil", whose creation we witness, and whose film uses its name, is in fact nothing special. The chord series, which was not originally original, was used for a much better effect in Led Zeppelin's "Thankyou" (Led Zeppelin II). Apart from that, 'Sir' Mick Jagger declares in his usually sober manner (rather than Bob Dylan) - note how the first melodic phrase is unpredictably repeated to form the verse. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this movie do not seem to know what they are fighting for; the most interesting scenes involve the comparison of fascism with pornography; a message that undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today (indeed a message that would be The Rolling Stones' behavior around the time the film was made). <br /> <br /> No wonder, The DVD came free with The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical outline of left-wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
