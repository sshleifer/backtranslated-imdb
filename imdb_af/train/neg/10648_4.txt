The finals of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies are rather poor. There are a few things that derail this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends a lot of the film wearing floppy sandals. According to me, any shoes on Tarzan, whether sandals or boots that are sometimes portrayed, are taken away from the character that ancient civilization and pro-jungle should be. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, haunts the movie as the cartoon. For me, his character is unnecessary for the movie's plot. <br /> <br /> Also, while Weissmuller still cuts a commander than Tarzan, it's clear he wasn't in his best shape. Although in his later Jungle Jim movies, his body improved a bit from this movie. <br /> <br /> The seafood fight is a great idea, but I think it should have happened in an earlier Weissmuller movie when he reached his physical peak. Similarly, the battle, which takes just 30 seconds to top, will be much more exciting if it is pulled out 90 seconds after 2 minutes, such as the classic giant crocodile match in Tarzan and Sy Mate. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye. It can't save the last Weissmuller movie - a disappointing end to a big character run.
