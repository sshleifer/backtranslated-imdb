So much is wrong with this bitterly funny movie of a movie that is hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First, it's a remarkable, scary and screaming movie, even according to American standards. The dialogue is clich√©, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is high, and the small story is not coherent or distant. <br /> <br /> We follow the following stereotypes in sequence: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie doesn't tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who doesn't do anything heroes) , Brave Little Kid (with a murderous stripe a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Titch (with more brawn than brain). These guys take a constant battle with the Long Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of evil little metal balls threatening around men. Given a chance, they perform impromptu brain surgery to those who do not have the mental acuity to duck when they come to them. Booh! In fact, one of them is being hunted by a good ghost (but then it may be a fraudulent ghost) who intends to help our Brave Contagonists get their young kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> There is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters. It starts with a repeat of the end of the previous movie, but it doesn't explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, that's fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are related, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should make sure they live or die. As a result, you do not. The only point of interest is any shattering effects. And there's not enough of them to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> Potential interest / entertainment is the three Raider Punks, as stupid as they are angry, threatening our Heroes. But they don't get much screen time. They are almost immediately attacked. Then they are buried (why someone should take the time, is beyond me), then they appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies. Just to be again, literally within a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie looks mainly from Caspar's Friendly Spirit who appears and disappears, drives around to search places, and Balding Loser tries to score as Bad Black Titch Booty, using pickup lines who will embarrass a mentally retarded teenager. No dice there; Not even a few free sex could have saved this movie, so good there is never anyone. <br /> <br /> The head bad, called the Tall Man, can't scare anyone over 3 years of age; cry "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why, with its incredible telekinetic powers and rude torso strength, not only do we break our heroes like mistakes, they are not explained. Instead, he delegates the work to his unmarried, deprived minions, who never kill anyone before being shot at hell. <br /> <br /> Moviegoers who share masterpieces like "Friday 13th XXXXVIII: Jason Go to College" may find some entertainment. The rest of us, who have barely developed hair, will be bored from our skulls.
