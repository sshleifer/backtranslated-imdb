A recent report by a woman claiming a military background has the remark: a woman's life is no more valuable than a man. <br /> <br /> This mantra of politically correct is not true as well as history as well as biological display. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astounding speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the war in 1914-1918 in which more than two million of her men were killed. In South America's Triple Alliance War (1865), Paraguay adopted three neighboring countries until virtually all of its male population was wiped out, but fought much larger Bolivia in the 1932 Chaco War. <br /> <br /> However, no society has ever survived the loss of its female population. Only when people's lives are at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced the situation in 1948, but since then he has never seen cooperative units for his defense forces, despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is Hollywood fluff.
