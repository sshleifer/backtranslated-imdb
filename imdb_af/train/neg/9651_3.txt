The movie is a total crap. We have two good actors who are in disrepute and a meat chief of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is a crap. The characters sketched poorly. Non-existent storytelling. No editing to talk about. Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star .. this is a dream in itself. The movie draws to the point of decadence. The whole charade about Arjun bringing his Manna to London, let him make his girlfriend and not let him play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan is over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this producer Vipul Shah, but it's not one of them. All the good directors seem to fall prey to the Box Office mania .. that the Mumbai Media Morons created. This is another crap movie in the lines of "Wanted" with idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is good for Indian Cinema as Titanic was for the Winter Cruise business. On a positive note -I love Asin character dance Bharatnatyam when she changes to Western style dance when the teacher doesn't look.
