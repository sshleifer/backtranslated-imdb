Shecky, is a divine legend, makes no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain operating their testing department. We will go through many new starters, they will be expected to learn how to find fault, find the different detritus that is somehow absent from the stores. To test the solution of these new staff members, we are now testing a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie, because if someone who bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player who had this movie as a free gift bought to send their DVD player back, they never had Shecky sent back. Our new staff will be forced to just go overboard to test these machines for errors until they've got a disc or two of their own to test. <br /> <br /> Now, why is this movie so bad, where do I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who might be so funny, like in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, had to have passed half the day. The rest of the crew stank, and what about Billy Zane? His name comes in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolutely zero. <br /> <br /> I would tend to give it a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the courage to name it. This is the full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Yet it is worth a watch so you can see how far Sandler is and how low he can go.
