Action, violence, sex and coarse language are the things the characters do throughout the movie. And everything they do is done without cause. Mark L. Lester is (unknown) known for his violent (without reason) films (Commando, The Base). The story is strange, but silly. The actors play their stupid characters very well ... I don't tell them they are stupid, but I think they are very bad actors. This is another low-budget unfamiliar B-series stock film. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary, or something like this bad movie of the same kind as Misbotten, don't rent it ... and, by the way, don't rent the movies I mentioned ... I give it 1 and a half out of 5.
