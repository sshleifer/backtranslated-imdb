This movie is actually worse than most movies I've ever experienced, and I've suffered a lot. Absolute nonsense. It had terrible, forced dialogue; useless plot developments; really a ghostly spectacle, which looks more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving said women (forget about what you know about virgins, especially children with fake breasts); mumbled, difficult to understand speech of some characters; and they actually used Killer Klowns' outer space masks during a masturbation scene, which must be a saving grace, because the movie was pretty funny, but it wasn't. Veden Fell is the poorest bad man in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely, give this one a miss.
