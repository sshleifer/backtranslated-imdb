Don't drink the cooler. <br /> <br /> It's a piece of opinion disguised as a documentary. And to call it a "truth" is just plain crap. The debate on global warming is far from over and will only be over when the ecoombs begin to recognize the mountain of evidence in contravention of their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you'll find a river of information that reflects almost every link in the logic chain that Gore sites contain. The reason why it is so important for people to educate themselves is the catastrophic economic impact that preventative measures for global warming will have. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, a little bit of time and a little common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even credible. Don't just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis to really do. There is simply too much alternative and counter-evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so unreasonable, in fact, that it can be the largest single hoax in the course of human existence. It's time for people to start talking to this kind of propaganda and it's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can both be a conservation officer. And acknowledge the scathing conclusion that global warming is a great lie.
