The trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. Wish I'd been waiting for this movie to come on DVD because I wouldn't be at least $ 9. The movie misses the point completely. What a BIG movie could have been for all actors, in turn, became a B movie. Movie moves VERY slowly and just when I thought it was going somewhere, it almost did, but then it didn't. At this time and age, we need unpredictable plot kicks and movie closures, and this movie didn't even feature. The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, but not sure if it was the direction, the lighting, the delivery of lines, the writing or whatever, but nothing came of it. Many hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this movie and I tell everyone they won't see it. The cheesy saxophone music also made the film worse. And the end has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
