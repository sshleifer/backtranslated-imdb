Earlier today I argued why so many people complain about modern films in which I got a strange statement: "The character development in new movies is just not as good or interesting as it was." Depending on the movie (s) involved, it can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven Hollywood rubbish such as War Of The Worlds, but in the case of over-the-top, uninteresting social commentary efforts and a desperate struggle to put "art" back into the theater, it's movies like Dog Days that blame it. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very high level of tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or useless I find them (ranging from good, long like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I considered painful to sit by a la-alpha dog and wild wild west). I finished this movie for 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I actually need. I was not interested in any of the characters and found nothing more than a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an effort to say something about the dregs of society, this film falls too easily self-reliant, thin and exploited in a very sincere sense. Admittedly, I have seen many disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are so many better films about them on depressed, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain great emotional characters and personality. Dog days had nothing more than an eighth degree deviation for society, and chose to ignore any real intelligence about how people actually are and rather choose a dull, terrible and hopelessly irreproachable effort for a work of art. be. It is not a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation in the dregs of society, it is just boring and nothing caring.
