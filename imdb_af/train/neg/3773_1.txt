When people ask me, what's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not even close to MST3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theater, or even as a Disney channel late night filler. The only time I ever wanted to go to Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios) from Disney World was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket from the mannequin, tear it, and tie it to the tour guide's throat . Eat it! Eat this unholy dress of darkness !!! I've never been so fond of a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". You want beautiful colors and cinematography? Is not here babe. Reviewers keep saying, "Oh, but it also looks like a cartoon". Well, to me it's the color of a Gordito after a few weeks in the sun. About so pleasant. Beatty wanders around this landscape to jump around and talk to his watch, himself and now and then to the other actors, hoping someone will tell him how late the sequel will shoot. To be honest, I first saw this movie, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a God.
