I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was that true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins. Everyone has some talent, but here everyone was basically a Cinemax-style movie. <br /> <br /> Sadly, "Alien Intruder" is trying to be unique, with a computer virus / alien demon / harp / whatever you want to call her Ariel (Scoggins). infiltrates this kind of high-tech virtual reality station aboard a space ship where four men are allowed to live their fantasies, as the system is overshadowed by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but here's everything just like a well-filled episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams climbs everything right and left, and seems to be doing something else, rather than doing anything else. Oh, the things people do for money .... <br /> <br /> The FX is pretty static, maybe even less than you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheap like this. Unfortunately, even the female nudity is less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the right star here and of course it gets ALL the best screens. <br /> <br /> If you're into a movie that's all plagued and no brain, look at "Alien Intruder". Of course, you probably won't have to watch Cinemax for 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> No stars, even for what might power this movie be collected. <br /> <br /> Let this one lose in space.
