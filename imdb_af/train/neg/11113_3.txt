I often feel like Scrooge, movies movie that others are brilliant - or I write the review to balance unjustified raves. I found this movie almost immovable, and unusual to me was fast forward not only through dull, clich√© dialogue, but even dull, clumsy music numbers. Whatever originality exists in this movie - unusual interior for a musical, a lot of fantasy, some animation - is more than offset by a script that doesn't have our odd or inconspicuous plot development. Individuals, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. Also not really charismatic or have many sex appeal. They are both smart. I like Billy Gray, but his character is nice one-note. The best part of the movie, for me, is June's oat's beautiful costumes and big body.
