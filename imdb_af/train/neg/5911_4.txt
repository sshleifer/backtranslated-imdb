POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The Spy Who Shagged Me is a very overstated and over-rated successor. Mysterious International Man came straight out of the blue. It was a lonely star that few people heard about. But it was wonderfully original, has sophisticated humor and generous humor, always in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The Spy who shook me was much more commercially advertised and overhauled. <br /> <br /> OK, I will admit, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very funny, but only after watching it. or three times you see all the bugs. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham couldn't act. Her performance didn't look very convincing and she wasn't as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. The characters thrown in the first (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc) are thrown into the background and do not get many stand-alone scenes. The movie was simply overrun with cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated how they totally ignored the screens in IMOM. When they first killed Vanessa and left Basil, he knew she was a fembot. What was the point? They killed the number one in the first one, and now they bring him back without any explanation. It is supposed to be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the movie. It just goes on a route. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size 'joke soon becomes very old. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross humor. In total, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is either tasteless or from IMOM. <br /> <br /> If it were the first movie of the series, I would probably be easier. But the series started on a note of dry white and then fell to some degree of brutal humor. So I say, just watch this movie if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the biggest disappointment.
