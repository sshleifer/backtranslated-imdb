This movie is trash-poor. It has terrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in writing, though presumably based on real events - which doesn't add much to everything, but makes it more of a disappointment. Direction is not well done as screens and dialogue are outside. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. For starters, Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship division, and the relationship itself is not interesting. What's worse, his character is forced by an ugly pedophile story that is basic and has no place as a plot device. You have an older Rory Culkin tasteless spraying "d_ck_smker" - in good fun - which is annoying enough and then laughed at the Williams character. Ultimately, you have Sandra Oh as a guardian guardian of Williams and a throw in explaining the entire fiasco at the end. Toni Collete's character is just annoying and a repetition of her 6th Sense performance with weaker direction. Very Miss-able.
