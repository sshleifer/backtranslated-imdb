First, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic writings. There is also nothing wrong with making a movie like this to present the gospel message. So my concerns with this movie are not in its sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian, although amilian, I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he has said so much. So, even though I didn't even agree with this movie about the rapture, that's not why I considered this movie so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes the movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, terrible writing, mediocre acting, and pitiful FX. This movie stands there with some of the cutest scifi feeds of the 1950s. No, this movie is there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie did not age well and was probably dated by the time they made a successor. <br /> <br /> The apocalypse genre producers could have learned how not to make an end-time movie out of it, but they failed. The left-back series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega code series have not all learned this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated viewing problem, but their scripts are still poor and their play is wood. <br /> <br /> There are good Christian movies, with extremely low budgets, but this movie is not one of them. I'm surprised the MST3K crew never have this one.
