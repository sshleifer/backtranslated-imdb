I'll keep it short; Thanks to Greg for helping me to put it briefly: Captivity is about a man who drinks drugs, puts her in prison and tortures and then as a prisoner to have sex with her. This is the single twist and punchline of the movie. This is torture as slow motion date rape. And it's not even a good movie. It's not that bad, it's good; It's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that critics include a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, although some are on one request because it is so misleading. Why didn't anyone have the cojones to stand up and say, "It's garbage, and that's why," is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't give your money to these little ones.
