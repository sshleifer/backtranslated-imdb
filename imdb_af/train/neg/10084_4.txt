This movie was okay, but it definitely claimed that homosexuals were "so born", especially if a woman could get out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman. It looks like Kate's gender preferences like a switch are turned on, and it seems a bit simplistic. <br /> <br /> Also, as is common with movies trying to push an agenda, it was a pity. that those characters in the film having questions or disapproval of the gay lifestyle are labeled "bigots". And there was no happy medium. It was either Kate's friends and family hugged her completely or they totally avoided her. It's not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. This is usually a mix of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love and treat people, while not necessarily comparing the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film has shown no such interaction. For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it has struck me as a very intolerable movie! Then Kate decides in the end after all the years she wants to be with Mac and everything is young dory - is that what gay really is about? Come on!
