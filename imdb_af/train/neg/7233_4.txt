I feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one to see through this fake movie. I watched it three times, once with comment, and I found myself at all the close-ups, all the times the screen just turned black, and worst of all, I feel the movie never really solves anything . Yes, the priest dies, but he did not really have peace with the town that gave him so much sadness or self. That and he was an idiot. If it wasn't for Peter Cowie's comments, which didn't just explain the movie, but the book it came from, I couldn't stomach it at all. I enjoy French movies, but it is absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> The diary of a land priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography, but it alone cannot save these deadly dull trips. Scene after scene of extreme close-ups where characters say nothing to the camera cut and go out to a black, DO NOT make an interesting or relevant story. How this film ever became a classic is surprising: it reminds me of the emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, Claude Laydu's performance is sincere and thoughtful, if you're a sadist, but this movie is over. I feel empty because it is generally a poor impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is an uncompromising and complicated institution of corruption. The young priest's victory over the Countess's pride is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will divert you with its dry introspection and window into the young priest's melancholy thoughts. This priest does not come as much as to be humble, for he is not sorry. <br /> <br /> Because I don't speak or understand French, I was looking forward to doing the English SUBTITLE thing to understand the movie. Well, the English SUBTITLE is sometimes impossible to see / read and the text rolls so fast that there were many that I couldn't read (and I'm not a very slow reader. I just completed 3 days in Dostoyevsky) . <br /> <br /> I wanted this movie. I try everything that is "selected" by the Criterion Collection, and yet I can't see why it somehow somehow deserves some critical nod. However, I put this whole two-hour filmlust to feel some kind of empathy for the main character, and it never realized. He looks like a victim rather than a fighter. And for that I say it bump.
