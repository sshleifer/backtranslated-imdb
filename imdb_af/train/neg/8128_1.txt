OK, don't let my summary fool you. This movie sucks hard. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible in ways people didn't have to stretch their brains to describe. But it is in no way worse than Manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, horrors of spiders, or a small handful of movies. As a review, the movie sucks, it's awful. Don't see it without MST or you can develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
