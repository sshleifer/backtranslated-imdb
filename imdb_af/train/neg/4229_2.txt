I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! It must be the worst piece of monkey I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site and thought it would be horrified in my taste, but I got bored and turned it off. Let's look: <br /> <br /> The wardrobe: Consists of inexpensive dressed outfits and home decor painters' outfits. The masks are made of what looks like can. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: Was Terrible! I didn't think about the dubbing. I find this humorous as in Ittenbach's Premutos (big movie). The fighting and action rows were pi $$ poor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't watch any of Schnaas's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same kind and subject. See Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and the necromantic.
