I fail to see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be sci-fi). It's just "let's see what happens soap this week" and oh the Cylons are involved in flashbacks. <br /> <br /> The Cylon babe who nails the other man is pretty lame, it's pretty clear that T & A has been added to the show. Every time she comes up, I am indignant about WTF going on. And don't even try to tell me about "story bows". <br /> <br /> It's a soap opera with some CGI gut. This is not science fiction except the original point of departure. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that it has gained. If you like trendy, edgy, dodgy, jumpy, vague editor-on-crack camera work, this display can be for you. Since nerds look like this, it's a clear indication that voting views of Picard's TNG have changed.
