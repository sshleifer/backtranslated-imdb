this documentary is based on a sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it, the integrity slowly sinks into a large stack of shit, for example Bart Sibrel claims to have several sources of lighting because the shade appears to be the case if it does. two or more shadows for each object, when Apollo 11 went through the Van Allan radiators, they published 30 mins there. There were not the 90 mins claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation that is more similar to that of an x ​​ray. <br /> <br /> doing serious research really happened, don't let this pile of documentaries fool you into what really happened
