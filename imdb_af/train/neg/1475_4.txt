Most episodes on Season 1 are terrible. There is no comparison with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as their programs actually had decent story lines. Most of the Amazing Stories are dull. Not surprisingly at least. Go or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I heard Season 2 of this series is much better. Also for some reason on the DVDs they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further reduce this composition. The one cool thing is to see actresses and actresses when they were younger in 1985. However, most of the story lines are very predictable and the range can be better with turns and turns that have left you.
