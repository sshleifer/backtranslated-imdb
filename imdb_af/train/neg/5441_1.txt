Of all the movies I've seen, this one, The Rage, has yet to be one of the worst. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot script and dialogue made me cry in pain. "How can anyone come up with something like that? Gary Busey is known for his" B "movies, but this is a sure" W "movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take for example : About two dozen FBI and local law enforcement officers surround a trailer with a jeep carriage, inside the jeep is MA and is "confused" about why all the police are going. at the jeep with Gary and a company blowing away from them, police falling like dominoes and the jeep with Gary floating around in circles and not hit by a single bullet / pellet - MA is dead and Gary seems to have not noticed - damn that man is hard, actually a miracle, not since the six-cutter had 300 bullets, there was such a miracle.
