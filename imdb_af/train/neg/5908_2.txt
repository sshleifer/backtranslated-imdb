This one is a little better than the first one. It's still dependent on a lot of humor that basically says the old Bond movies were not realistic. It carries thinly to so many parodies. The girls were more interested in this one. <br /> <br /> There is a tremendous amount of total gross humor. Hopefully one day, true comedy will come back.
