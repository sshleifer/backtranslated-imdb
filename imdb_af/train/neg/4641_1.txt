I sometimes enjoy nice movies ............................................. ............................... Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 of Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> So when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic," was considered by many to be the single worst movie of the decade. Of course I just saw it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I'm sorry about that decision. This movie is very bad. It's so bad it isn't even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie. The acting, filming, mini-dissertation, etc. Is even worse than a low budget porn movie. The sound is absolutely horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "play" is laughing. It is a complete waste of time and money for everyone. At least the porn movie has porn to break the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a man who presses a rotten apple, and a "crazy chicken's" tea party. <br /> <br /> The lighting does not exist. Many "scenes" occur in half or bright darkness. This is probably just as good. The "writer-director" (David Tybor uses the terms) tries to get kinky with slavery ... but the results will be ridiculous if they are not so pathetic. There are some nudity, but it's such an abominable quality that it actually acts as a sexual oppressor. I can last forever and not do all the flaws and shortcomings of this really horrible waste of the movie. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid this train wreck. I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you can still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as I suppose it should be .... but trust me ... It is even worse than I said, and you will regret the experience (and cost, if you waste your money on a purchase or rent).
