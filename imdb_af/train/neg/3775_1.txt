As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are bold. I think the director rather turned away with his "artistic vision" about the appearance of the film. Despite his star cast, the performances are lackluster and the story almost incoherent. Madonna was probably thrown purely as a stunt to get press release. A good thing like her appearance here, has some faith in her album, "I'm Breathless" (music inspired by the movie Dick Tracy), a stratospheric hit (mainly due to the inclusion of dance hit "Vogue" is not in, nor is the slightest relationship with this movie). I would guess that most of the money came from this movie from tie-ins to Madonna's album "I'm Breathless". <br /> <br /> If you look at home, through end titles, you'll think "there are two hours out of my life, I'd like to have back." Save yourself the wasted time - don't worry about it.
