Not funny - how can someone link it to Monty Python? It is absolutely ridiculous - there is no laughter. It's not funny. Over the top, but ugly, weird, just for strange things and it seems to me these people were always on something. Unfortunately something has not made them funny. <br /> <br /> It needs a few points for effort, etc. Given. Actually, there seems to be a lag track - or is there one? Hummm .... As there is hardly any laugh that is a debatable question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing it wrong - maybe it's a kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in that case, anything goes without saying. <br /> <br /> But these guys play women with high voices, noses raised. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir who is clear on Monty Python's intellectual wit and that is Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
