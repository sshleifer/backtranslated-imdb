"Everything a big documentary can be" ?? Yes, if someone is deaf, stupid and blind. Everything except meaning, white, visual style and interesting topic. Apart from that. . . <br /> <br /> Serious, peoples. It's a movie that's totally uncomfortable. An adventure dock with no adventure, a war dock with no sense of war, a camping set up without tracks. It means nothing, feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that is absolutely nothing. No wonder it has so many IMDb fans! Of course, if you know that a movie with the big Lip Lipman goes, will there be no culture, no intelligence, no white (other than a corrosive adolescence) and no recognizable human emotion? not adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There is too much real documentary and too little time to waste it on toilet construction like "Darkon".
