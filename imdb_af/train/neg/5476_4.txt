I don't know if it's one of SyFy Channel's original movies, but that's exactly what it feels. A low-cost, low-budget action movie that is likely to be made very fast contains ludicrous effects, lame dialogue and one vague blur to give a few brand name recognition (funny how many 90210 kids are doing cheap TV movies now). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, who knows us from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of indigenous people while conquering parts of North America. Here he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a smart opportunist; His character is likely to be murdered if it is not loosely based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a brief survey mission, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves funding to further explore America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the story seems to be Lt. Rios, which is apparently honorable, resourceful and wise. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, in opposition to Cortes, as well as to the young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the heady, twilight shaman falls to Rios and aggravates his anger at Spanish outsiders. So this is all beautiful clich√©. The dinosaurs are transmitted relatively comfortably. Despite being in a wide open area, the story takes only 95% of the time in the forest or in the Aztec town. It is also not visually exciting. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared into it. He doesn't look for Spanish for a second, but makes the decisive choice wrong in every way. If this movie theater was released, he would be singled out for a Razzie. No problem. <br /> <br /> Overall, forgotten.
