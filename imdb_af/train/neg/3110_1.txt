I usually come to this site before going to the movie, because I want to see what other people think of the movie. I read many reviews that said "thriller is not a horror movie". It asked me to try this movie. I really have to worry about these "thriller / horror" statements because it wasn't! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if you enjoyed many reviewers of this garbage .... well, you have to be easily satisfied! At the end of the movie, people behind me said aloud, "A waste of time" and I looked at them and replied, "I couldn't have summed it up better." I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it didn't. There was the potential for very good horror stories (or excitement if you wanted to), but nothing happened. Williams did the part quite well, but I felt he was short-changed by a poor manuscript running around and going nowhere. Save your money, it's a turkey that will appear at a "bargain" at a DVD store in the near future!
