I usually have no problem walking away from a bad movie, but it was a unique case. This movie was so bad I actually sat down and prayed almost the whole thing. It would have had one minute of good movie time to hide the half an hour. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. In a beach house where a group of college friends celebrate holiday, this movie suffers from numerous problems that are not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Secondly, very little of the C list (I dare not even call them B) actors can be worth a damn, so any scenes that fail potential fail. Third, the course of the film is very sloppy and uncomfortable to track most of the time, and makes a lot of trouble for the audience. Fourth and above all, the end is totally anti-climate partly due to how it ends (which the killer seems to be) and partly because the dialogue is just horrific. For the movie credit, this is the only movie I will ever say is the worst movie I've ever had, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, just like a bad joke, you would have all the happier never heard, next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you won't shout, you work really not as you go in the opposite direction.
