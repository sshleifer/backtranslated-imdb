Considering his pedigree, it should be a much more enjoyable movie than it is. Even with a lips-smacking collection eccentric in the movie - which aficionado won't eagerly expect a movie to bring along Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is dully paced, drearily shot and, often, not witless. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not really slips, as she confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good comedian, as he demonstrated in movies from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he gets better from this mess than anyone else does. Except the cat.
