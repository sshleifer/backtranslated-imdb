Well, you'd be better off planning this amateur, dull and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mother who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teenage daughter than she wants. In Tunis, the mother sits around the apartment, gets antsy and decides, though unwilling (she can't help her), the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter is taking dance lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This movie is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the captions, fast forward through lots of the usual dance and loooong shots of walking (they run everywhere) and more and just dawdling at x4 just to get this boring , unbeatable, low budget slip, which some of them gained some good critical plaudits. Go figure. (C-)
