Because I heard so much of the 1990's Cracker series without seeing any of them, I eagerly watched it. Certainly, the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane couldn't go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The controversy, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, was overwhelming. The production tried to be super modern, but the flickering boxes and even the childish font were irritated. Robbie Coltrane walked through the two-hour sleep, with inexplicable and unlikely "insights", and police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots. As a result, the tension that was never built up and the next-to-last scene (no details of fear of spoilage) was so badly a piece of TV drama as I have seen long ago. <br /> <br /> No, I don't want to see this anymore, but I go back to the DVDs of the 1990s to see if they fit their reputation.
