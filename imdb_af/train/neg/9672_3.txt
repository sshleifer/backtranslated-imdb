While most of the movie is very amateurish, the Kosher battlefield is played, but not untrue. Kosher law says an animal should be aware when the blade touches its skin. The Kosher battlefield is accurate as anyone knows who saw one, or the Peta movie saw a Kosher massacre, cutting the animal's throat. The esophagus cuts out while it is still alive, conscious and of course suffering. We must remember that history was written by the victors. Is one even allowed to think that the Nazis are right? <br /> <br /> Does it say nothing that the Nazis banned this unholy religious slaughter, and the Jews still practice it today?
