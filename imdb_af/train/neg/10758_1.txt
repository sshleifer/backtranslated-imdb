It's probably the most boring, worse and useless movie I saw last year. The plot intended to have some philosophical aspects occurred to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix, with many clich√©s: the lonely wolf man, beautiful, psychologically disturbed, slept with his gun ... + beautiful hard worker and shy but beautiful psychologist, you add a 2 cents plot and you have me, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEx, Audi, conversations etc. This movie bumps into commercialization and tends to be a poorer ad that unfortunately won't end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend it to my worse enemy. If you have a little free time, watch a good TV program or read a nice book.
