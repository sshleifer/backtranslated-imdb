Now, I hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He's an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think it was just because he realized how silly this movie was, and didn't bother with a good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines just broke me. And there are a few lines that don't make sense, and it looks like Tobe Hooper just throws in lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! VAT the plot is BAD! But this is one of those movies that TAHT BAD is that is actually PAINFUL to watch. I only recommend it to BIG Brad Dourif fans, or fans of any of the other actors, as the plot is pathetic.
