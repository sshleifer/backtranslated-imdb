I grew up Baptist and I know the story that this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. I will give the movie buddy to be as good as the average life movie of the week. Slightly interesting, mediocre, slightly slow, the writing is predictable, the music is juicy, and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind must be the funniest clean non-Christians. Not one swear word from any of them. But I laughed aloud as the actor played the man who invented the United Nations' core as "now-cueer", just like Bush. Is there a Christian Code of Conduct that suggests that since Bush claims he was also called by God, all Christians should cover his ignorance, by condemning the word in the same way as he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously. After the "now-cue" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something brave. Actually, I was looking for something that could make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for sensible entertainment, stop here - it's a good time to murder a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
