While it's early to say how the series will develop, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be. However, there is still potential for the series. Of course when I first saw Voyager, I thought it had potential too - but was very disappointed. My stomach tells me that Enterprise won't be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> Concerning the impressions of the pilot ... <br /> <br /> The pilot has good ideas and good themes. I like the introduction. The opening credits of the shows were interesting, with the course of exploration and an appropriate theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> What made me feel short was that the story lacked the feeling of a great adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more of a "generic" draft story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step to space", only subplot and subtext. If you were to change the references to the first deep clearance mission, it would be difficult to distinguish between the era of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot did not reflect or correct the large theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot of the launch of the first mission would have been big enough without the "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh for a TV show that will make us think again). Let us feel the excitement of the wind and be on the sea instead of saving us with a rescue and an abundance of gunplay. There WAY was too much gunplay. <br /> <br /> We had the feeling that people were "freshmen" in an established school. New kids on the block, as opposed to a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of finding us. That meeting could have been much more historical and much more sociological. Just how do two such different societies vary? Don't just think about it, show it! <br /> <br /> I had to think it more than "Draw with an akward crew and limited technology" as opposed to "the first brave steps in the unknown". I wanted to see something newer and fresh. The series promises to have a new concept, but so far I haven't seen this new good concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude by repeating the sentiment that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The overall theme has been the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future deviations can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Strength Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> To the producers: MAKE RISKS AND MAKE US * THINK *! :-)
