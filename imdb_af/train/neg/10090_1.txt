This movie is a joke. I mean a "ha ha" funny joke. Why? Because the only redeeming thing about this was the good laugh, I came upon the mere indulgence of nonsense, inexorable plot and horrible acting. Wow! <br /> <br /> Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie's "overseers" and what are their goals? Since when did 6 people make a "nation" of zombies? And is there black eyebrows "scary" for everyone, everywhere? Even a 2 year old? <br /> <br /> And lastly; Why is this movie smoothed? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> On the request channel, they actually issued this comment to the synopsis of the movie: We apologize for this movie in advance. "LOL. At least they had the decency to do so much!
