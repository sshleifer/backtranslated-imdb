I'll be short ... This movie is embarrassing for everyone except the movie. The fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are "treated" to an urgent dance scene. The plot is ridiculous no one but the most fiery fan of BAD abomination will get something out of it. And for the love of God, don't stop saying that this movie is a story of innocence that is lost or even of female empowerment, because it's obvious (childlike fumbling lesbians, what hell?). it was by far the worst movie at the Edinburgh Festival (which I saw anyway), someone even collapsed halfway through the movie, probably because they couldn't take it anymore. It may look like an overly critical rant, but I really can't find a redemptive feature of this movie, except perhaps if you consider it a pure comedy. In short, this film is best viewed on a sundowner of class A drugs.
