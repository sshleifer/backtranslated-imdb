What can I say about this movie other than "don't see it". I waited and waited and waited for wateting (or anything) to happen and it just didn't come. Look great when two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie. What are they doing? Do they solve a mystery? Are they gathering clues? Maybe it's just hard to tell. At the end of the movie, after many radio signals have been decoded (unreadable on some PET monitor) and give these old readings, the plot is eventually revealed and discarded as soon as possible. Some strangers want to return to their home world utopia and are so happy there to blow up the earth (I think they don't like sharing the wealth). My guess is that they've finished filming and their 35 minute work or art (garbage!) Seen and decide they'll turn the editing team into an 88 minute movie. Look at your own danger, it's not even funny, because it's so bad, it's just bad.
