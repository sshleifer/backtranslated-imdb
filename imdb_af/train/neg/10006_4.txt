I don't know who to blame, the sly writers or the clueless director. It was one of those movies that paid so much to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough to really make a movie. It could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of mischief, even cowardice, hanging over every scene. As it did get a R-score anyway, why was the well-known bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why Does Sheen Sleep Through Potentially Hot Relationships With TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES IN THE WORLD? If they were just looking for laughter, don't throw Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? It was so predictable. I was surprised to find that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not just for the viewers, but also for the actors.
