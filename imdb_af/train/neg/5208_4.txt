This mini-series, also based on a book by Alex Haley, such as 'Queen', tried to use similar formulas, namely building a long history that follows the lives of a family over many years. As it was masterful in 'Queen', the inspiration was lacking here in Mama Flora. First, perhaps in the book itself, and certainly in this TV production. Too much is over-used with over-hasty over the years, so the unfolding saga is level, superficial, not nearly as authentic as in 'Queen'. Full marks for the painting in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progresses, it looked like a kind of dallasian-forsythian unpleasant mix in the last third of his three hours or so lasted a long time. I was hoping for more; but apparently Haley was less inspired by this story than his near-biographical 'Queen', and Peter Werner III is not a match for John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these long stories of generations growing up.
