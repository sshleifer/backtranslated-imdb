It is clear to see why the creators of Scary Movie have found it so easy to spoof these 'teenage cat movies'. They are so incredibly formal. And if Valentine was released a year or so earlier, they're sure they'd spoof this movie too - that's if they found any real original material to distinguish it from the Screams, I know what you did last summer, and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending that leaves plenty of room for the inevitable successor. As always, a masked psychotic killer bumps into a bunch of beautiful young women, and the main character's friends, one by one, are usually killed in the top style. Many on-screen T&A, no character development, bad acting, and too much complicated bloodshed. <br /> <br /> The thing I can't handle these types of movies is that they leave themselves "who did it?" The thing is, they aren't because the motive is first revealed once the killer unmasked, telling the main character whose friends have already been murdered, usually something that has never been made clear in the film (eg, the main character's uncle's fish partner kicked his friend's father's dog). The movie is left "a suspect," but they are more "Red Herrings" than suspects. As we all know at this point, the main character manages an indescribable escape and kills the unmasked psycho-murderer after the motive is revealed. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway) ** ************* In Valentine's motive, the motive is not revealed, but more, you have left to think about the fact that the film does not completely distract in the typical one slash 'way. The problem is only partially resolved, and the goal of the killer may or may not be met by surviving the bloodshed and almost killing everyone. Would the murderer want more, or were the devils really busy? <br /> <br /> Still, Valentine hasn't made a good movie, but it saved it just as usual, which doesn't count too much. To think anyone about making another movie, please do not. Originality is so important, and it is difficult to see any originality from this genre.
