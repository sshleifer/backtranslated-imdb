Claire Denis' movies are in one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not as terrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil." <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw "Chocolat", I made it a point to see every new movie made by Denis. And I've always been disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has not yet made a movie so personal and so moved as her first one. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of Denis tribal: an older but still beautiful Béatrice Dalle who just seems to be in the movie to show her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her generous fuss , and some nice coats; the black man of "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai fit sommeil," Grégoire Colin, and the Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera was lying on him for so long that I hung over the forehead through the curly hair and was relieved when he thought somewhere in Korea he had finally cut it. <br /> <br /> There was definitely some action - gruesome murders, a man's search for a boy - and there might even be a plot, but one look wasn't enough to figure it out. , and two views I fear from the question. For one thing, the score was crooked and intrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). For the others, the seasons changed too suddenly, so you were even more confused about what was going on. Oh, there were some nice shots, and if you hold "Friday night" with its shots of the folds in heavy curtains and bedbugs, you can appreciate the L'Intrus aesthetics. Otherwise, send it away. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something critical. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages, double spaced and with enough margins. In "Chocolat" the silence is sublime; In "L'Intrus," it's not boring.
