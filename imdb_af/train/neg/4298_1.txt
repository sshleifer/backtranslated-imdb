Incredibly disturbed, abominable and ultimately ridiculous ("the horses, my God, the horses!"). It's sometimes scary, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. See how in the last 10 minutes everyone does "magic" exactly what the plot needs to make the "resolution" take place. Bland performances by the lead, a typical eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
