No, <br /> <br /> You actually look at something that doesn't make sense. Not to spoil the movie for people who really want it, watch the movie. I'll explain the story. <br /> <br /> An ordinary daily woman walks down the street and finds herself in her own car. She follows her and many events take place during that time that includes her and her family. <br /> <br /> I specifically commented on this movie to comment on how terribly written it was. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story only brought it nowhere - it can be added incredibly and made into a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer is trying to do by doing so, usually at the end of movies. Most of your questions get answers, but this movie has asked you: What just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just failed for nothing. /> <br /> Spoiler Begins <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (we and behind the glass) that would come in our world and kill us. It was not worked out during the film, and you never know how it happened, or why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the film. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the movie, the man who eventually reaches out and runs away (her sister's boyfriend) must have been the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, it quickly took out. Don't waste your time. I really hope nothing as it is made again.
