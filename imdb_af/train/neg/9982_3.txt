Story starts slowly and nothing funny happens for a while. All the action is in the end, but you don't have to laugh, because the movie is funny but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey 'I'm not Paranoia'. Keitel really lost it and the judge started a massacre. Oscars for this man!
