Remade today, this movie will be a very creepy, very disturbing dark comedy. Stalking, obsession, and a web of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 glamor from their non-cute indulgence. Drake plays the stalker, a petty user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the stalking victim, alternately angry and unaware. <br /> <br /> Very disturbing; I couldn't watch classic romance with the same suspension of unbelief since. <br /> <br />
