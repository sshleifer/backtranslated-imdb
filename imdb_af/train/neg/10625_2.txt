I am an 11th degree at my high school. In my current world business class a child in my class had this video and suggested we look. So we did. I strongly believe that we have gone to the moon because my father works for NASA. Although I think this movie is the biggest piece of shit I've ever watched, the man who created it has some serious balls. First, did he have to shoot JFK? And how dare he use all the biblical quotes. The only good thing about this movie is sparks debates, which are good b / c in my class, we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore have to work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next movie can be called "A Funny Thing Happened on September 11th" or "A Funny Thing Happening to the White House".
