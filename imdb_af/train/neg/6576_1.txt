I totally disagreed with the comments that said it was a good movie. It's a completely successful movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The story development is strange. Mia Kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun-looking chick for no convincing reasons. In addition, all the actresses have become too old to be university students. College students looked about 30 years. You found out the rest. I just watched over the first ten minutes and quickly started looking for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are lame, hurry and, above all, no frontal. All the sex scenes were laughing, considering how many clothes they had. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 out of 10.
