I never found Charley Chase very funny, although his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, which I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's Sunday Post cartoon page.) In Chase's best movies, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I will admit Chase that his best films such as 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Wooden Wedding' have a fandom that proves him very faithful ... but I am positive that even the most hard-core Chase fan will agree that the very early and very rough 'Married to Order' is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - eager, uncomfortable, gormless, naff - is a young swain hoping to court the fair Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this movie as her blowhard father, who appears Chase as a "mollycoddle". Leo White, who did more work than a foil for Chaplin at Essanay, is here as a rival. There is some action about an Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the brand name in the dialogue is called titles: is it an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a big mistake in "Married to Order" is the Casting or Rosemary Theby as Rose: she is meant to be a standard issue, but Theby - shattered, hawk-faced - - is physically wrong for the role. Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but was never a credible grace. The film historian William K Everson treated her very much in one of his film books. <br /> <br /> I'll rate "Married to Order" just 3 out of 10, and I'm charitable ... because I suspect Charley Chase gets something that gets everyone else but I'm missing out.
