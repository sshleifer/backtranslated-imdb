There is no doubt that this film has an impressive role, but unfortunately it does not help with the great disadvantages of the movie. I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses not to use accents when it's clear to everyone they can't convince. Fiennes just can't do Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the acting will convince the character. If that for the big problem .... the plot .... was there one? I think there was some kind of story involved, but it was so full of holes I just couldn't wait for the movie to end. It was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and don't look at this movie!
