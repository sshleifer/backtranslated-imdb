A ruthless, tortuous and painful inability to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart of Mel Brooks's Blazing Saddles in his own weekly sitcom. It's really as bad as some people say it is! <br /> <br /> The laugh track only serves to remind the unidentified viewer what everything in this supposed comedy is meant to be a joke and just how desperate to laugh, is it really! <br /> <br /> It is a bit interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. his best to personalize Cleavon Little. His embarrassment appears in every scene. He was much nicer in the HBO movie El Diablo than he was in this cupboard! <br /> <br /> Surely the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
