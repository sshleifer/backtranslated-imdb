I'm never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong or even China. Strong acting quality is almost found in them, as evidenced by this film. I don't see myself as hard to obey as I, in fact, a fan of indie movies. But this movie shows poor plot and slow pace. I lost myself in the middle where the plot goes. The play certainly doesn't make it any better. Rainie's play is subpar if she is "over-act," trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to watch. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role than a confused, sad, regretted, highly reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.
