Like most people, I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this movie, especially the "filmmakers were attacked" which seemed to emphasize the case, which, with the picture on the front page of the movie makers being followed by fierce crowds . <br /> <br /> Watching and discovering the movie, oh, what they meant by "the filmmakers were attacked", some kids threw rocks on a board and a number of people complained loudly and said: "Someone has to beat up the two kids." The picture on the cover, "the chase" as it was? Total manufacturing. What I think is in keeping with the theme of the movie, lying and manipulating to satisfy in vain, stupid children with more money and time. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me", but as "Roger & Me" Moore was mocking Flint's people. It is completely wrong and completely wrong. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered from the communist yoke would be very excited to have markets full of food? What a shock! And it's not so much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and the western media blah blah blah", as it was not just that their counterfeit market had comparable prices for the competitors, so many people in the movie, prices were absurdly low, someone mentioned that they should have known it was fake by how much they took for duck. It proves nothing except that poor people go to a store with low prices, bravo fellas, how to keep it to the people. <br /> <br /> Get rid of a stupid practical joke on the elderly. You have to be very proud. How about your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will really be excited about a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say, "HAHA! NO HOUSEHOLD IS NOT EXISTING! YOU SO STOP AND LOVE TO BE TO THE MEDIA! ". <br /> <br /> Spurlock unleashes this wet movie from a movie and it's no surprise since Spurlock seems like One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world to throw his weight behind a foolish sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that doesn't really need it. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the pest.
