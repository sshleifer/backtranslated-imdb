I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I can do it a second time. Light entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon (think something about Maria), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. It's not the fun skirt The Love Bug was but it's watchful. One of my main deviations from the movie was the fact that Herbie had developed for the most part in R2D2 antiques. I was bored with the effects of headlamps over the second 30 or so times that they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go with your little ones, that is, the "single-digit bracket" kids and don't expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
