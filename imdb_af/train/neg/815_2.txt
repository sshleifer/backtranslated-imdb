I just got the British 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $ 5. The additional stuff includes the 1951 Superman and the Mole-Men feature. I slapped it in the DVD player last night, and here are my findings. <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointment - I didn't check out, and I think I mentally labeled it as one of the Kirk Alyn ranges. I'm not a big fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I've seen nothing but the strange clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey, never mind. <br /> <br /> These black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a few episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-party, compiled for the release of the film. IMDb says it was previously filmed as the first TV series. Anyway, it's a strange choice for reasons I will get later. I am of an age where I remember TV and movie productions limited to one or two places and sets. So there were no big surprises here. Yet, for a low budget film, this is one VERY low budget. <br /> <br /> The story is about the small town of Silsby population 1,430 - which is also mysterious, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story begins with the pit's foreman who is taking steps to shut down the well. This is inconsistent with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on behalf of the oil company on the well. As Clark sniffs the fact that the drill has emerged 6 miles in a radioactive cabin, a few strange little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumping pants, and bushes in eyebrows) come from the chopping hole, and start wandering village with confusing expressions on their faces. <br /> <br /> A breath now, here's the rest of the picture. The little guys frighten some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's turbulent xenophobe) calls on some pals to kill these "creatures". Superman enters (moderately inefficient) and catches one of the little guys shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn the cage where the other little one hid and assume he is dead, but he escapes and bones it in the shaft. Corey stabbed a lynch bull (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalized Mole Man. Superman enters the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return to his friends. A total of 4 Mole Men comes up with a kind of weapon they burn to Jeff Corey (I call it an Aargh! Gun because its only effect is to make Corey Aargh!) And Superman saves him. He immediately changed his ways because of surprise to Superman who saved him after he was carrying. The Mole men go back into the shaft. The end. <br /> <br /> Despite the film being just an hour, there is a modest amount of crawling, cautious and chasing. I left out all the "Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, watch out to make sure no one follows him" things. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way - they have no dialogue - they just get up, get persecuted and go back. They seem a bit creepy, but they are barely the bug-eyed monsters that imply the town's response. <br /> <br /> Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a stubborn reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. He doesn't just look at the part (at least his hair is colored black in it, which is an improvement on the light hair he had in some of the TV episodes). The way he plays it is wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to hit the pose (which Superman does consistently), but someone has to tell him that it should be fists on the hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays Superman as a fairly strict and pleasant teacher - he doesn't dare to put his finger in remonstration, but he can do just as well. <br /> <br /> And Superman does a lot of walking (I say a lot - he's not that much), and runs a little. He took off and landed a few times, but was not seen in flight at any time. Oh, some bullets reflect him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are noticeable in their absence, and the few present are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider this effort with reference to the standards of the time: but even through these standards I think this is a very urgent effort. Fortunately, the production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they had trouble drafting stories that had a little more for them. <br /> <br /> Something of a disappointment - I won't look again.
