I have two good things to say about this movie: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (consider what he had to work in terms of dialogue and direction). However, it said, I had this movie extremely tiring. Looking dry, would have been more entertaining. It looks much longer than 97 minutes. Start with the opening sequence, where everyone is talking about each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything that is said to him, the film is annoying. The film is filled with clich√©s and shtick, not to mention the endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. The director also had problems deciding to strive for laughter or tears. There are a few rows of touches, but they are all played for the laugh. As a skemaltie, sentimental, and "cute" appeal to you, you will love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, see another movie.
