It is truly awful: painfully annoying stylized artists shout and mug ungratefully disconnected dialogues that occur in scenes that seemingly have no purpose, no beginning, middle or end, without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intent, all in the service of some totally uninteresting and almost undetectable "story". What makes it worse is that the film's intentions are to "style": suddenly a remote cockpit screws down, and for no apparent reason there are sudden sweeps or wobble hand sections: all this "style" just doesn't enlarges the almost incredible misunderstanding of the project and the almost offensive void of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
