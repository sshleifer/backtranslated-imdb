To view this stinker is a cruel and indiscriminate punishment in the hands of Sandler. Really a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> Buy the DVD in the $ 5.88 bin at Wal Mart. But the thought that holds in my mind is, "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgettable thing about the movie is that the boat doesn't just sink! <br /> Best constructive proposal: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know the show on the sci-fi channel in which an old and its muppet machines spoof the most irreconcilable horror flicks (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, turn off a comedy program and play this movie. Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear viewers can actually start Sandler with ice cubes and chain saws. <br /> <br />
