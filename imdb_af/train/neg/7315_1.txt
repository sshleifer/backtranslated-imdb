OK, let's get right to the point. We have five recent college degrees (to be taken in the F-word) on a weekend camping trip. They walk in someone who needs help, but instead of helping him, they decide to rather burn him. Nice bunch of people. Then some of them start to get sick - have something in the water at the cabin they stay at. However, the neighbors look OK. Oh, well, when things get really bad, they join one of their companions instead of help (try the neighbor on the way). Some locals do not like them. They chase one at a high speed hull through the forest for miles until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he appears at the cabin (how he could get it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon types at the cabin realizes something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to make it blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin and believe it should be a kind of sanctuary. He was relieved by relief he had survived (he had thought it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortunately, some of them don't meet such friendly police officers. Another couple decides to have sex, while the meat eating screen works its magic, and then the woman realizes that she has to shave her legs (much of the sick skin with shaving cream). Anyway, you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I don't want friends with. I rooted for the meat eating bacteria. Other characters were introduced, which were also somewhat amusing, but also totally unknowable. Ninety minutes of good life is being wasted here.
