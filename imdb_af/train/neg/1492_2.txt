Last night I rented a group of Blockbuster movies, and that was the first one I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, wanted a horror movie fix). <br /> <br /> Wow, it was terrible, almost embarrassing so ... Mute slasher-type story I really thought movies like Scream had ended; amateur actors who render clich√©d and indifferent dialogue difficult to believe are actually typed and read a page; and gorgeous scenes that are nothing to get excited about (especially in a movie). <br /> <br /> But I've always believed that no movie is 100% totally worthless. Here are some good things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: Love this actress. She is the only member of the cast that shows any acting talent whatsoever. The only reason I rented this event was because her name was on the cover. She admonishes her presence in this drink with professionalism, though sometimes she seems to be acting in such a moronic story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Unconscious Hilarity: This is the kind of movie I can remember watching back when more theaters were cut across the country, and it was like a third movie on a three-quarter account , with a prestigious thriller movie that eventually made the way to the interior. Unfortunately, most viewers in this direct-to-video age now only endure these turkeys without the common experience of being part of an audience throwing yourself and throwing things on the screen because the movie is so horrible. This leads to-- <br /> <br /> # 3 Pornstars trying to do!: Usually at hand because the producers don't need to call or plead with them to exterminate for extended sex scenes, but this Exchange usually means that they actually get some lines that are supposed to promote a story (other than "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And proudly, they all provide expert advice to look foolish when trying to act. I would almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not an Irish mother and she was actually trying to do an accent, which just kept the smile. <br /> <br /> It is nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what I took of this cesspool aka "Evil Breed".
