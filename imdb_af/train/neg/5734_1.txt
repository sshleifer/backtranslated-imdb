It's the kind of movie that's so bad that you can't stop watching it, because you're telling yourself that "it can't continue to be this crappy all the way to the end. It just can't. You know, 'worse than Jaws 4' kind of bad. I honestly think I only saw ONE movie that was worse than this and then we speak religious crap about how you end up in hell to go to or watch football. <br /> <br /> Gore? Indeed and many of them. Well done gore? No way. <br /> <br /> The acting is over and all lines are lousy clich√©s. The same goes for the storyline that really only consists of sex, blood and violence, like so many other gore movies. <br /> <br /> Looking for a mix between Ichi the Killer and August Underground ?? keep looking. You won't find it in Live Feed.
