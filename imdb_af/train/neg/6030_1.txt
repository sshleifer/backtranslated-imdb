Okay, now I know there are millions of Americans who believe in the rapture. The moment when all people in Christ are born again, they will be raised to meet God and the rest of mankind will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire. and the sadness of psoriasis, as the Antichrist clashes with Jesus (in an uncharacteristic war mode). And I know the books were the best sellers. . Many believers, anyway. And I don't mean disrespect for everything. <br /> <br /> But I have to say, they packed this movie in a bag and hit the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot needs no repetition. Watching this movie gives you the chance to read the book. I might be one of the only people on earth who just looked at the mere bad moving experience and I wasn't disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the horrible little "Growing Pains" gremlin, who came upon that show, found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career went to the dogs, but now you can be happy to spread the word of God in movies so badly, it doesn't even release theater. Well, it's not quite true: I think it was the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST, with a voucher for a free movie show when it was released in the theaters! I still have the voucher! How many people do you think turned up? I don't know about you, but it never came to my town. Of course, I live in NYC, where our ungodly liberals sit down from the Bible and use them to roll joints. So there you go. In fact, I will be entering three million people on Manhattan Island. No one will be chased away. <br /> <br /> Watch the supplemental material on the DVD, where you will learn the creepy behind the scenes from these movies. . The CAST and CREW must all be of the same religious mindset. They do not come straight and say it, but listen carefully to what the filmmakers are saying. It's like a lot of Pod People gathered to make a Pod movie. How is it creepazoid? Honestly, these things just preach to the converts or not? Can you suggest someone who does NOT enter the entire apocalypse thing, to watch it, hit its forehead and say, "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I get better saved PRONTO!" Anyway, I'm addicted. I have to see the rest of this Christian fiasco movie, especially the one with Gary Busey, which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse to take part. . He crashed his head on a pavement as he crashed his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. And another thing. What about all the shots of poor, innocent dogs flashing, their leashes dragging on the ground, because their owners were called to heaven? How about this? Should we feel bad for the dogs, and if we do, what should we do about God? Isn't it a call to people that there is no room in heaven for the man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> That's another reason I'm agnostic. Good night and strength.
