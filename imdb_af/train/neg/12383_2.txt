While some performances were good, Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian girlfriends came in mind. The story was lame and distracted. The emphasis on the girl's racial background was best cloned. The family is mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not as real people. I found myself uncomfortable at many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can almost understand why the local newspaper here in SF said it was a good movie, and wondered who posted the glowing review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this movie, and crazy I was actually looking at a theater, based on the faulty connection to Garden State, which is a much smarter, more inventive, and touch than the one. I have to mention the emotional climax in the church, which was like wood and by-the-numbers that I almost left, and some in the audience actually did. THIS was followed by a stupid climax at the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before it happened. I really don't like being deceived to spend my money so useless.
