Schlocky '70s horror movies ... you must love. Contrary to today's boring slasher movie, these K-count offers actually do nothing and do not matter for a tired formula. <br /> <br /> It's a B movie about making a B movie ... which went terribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an overarching B movie queen who is making a movie about a series of Greek murders that a family has experienced in their home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and behaves like Gordon Jump, is on the spot and on a tight schedule filming. The Ken pop co-star discovers a book of Tibetan chants that they work in writing to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, who has long been looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), is now a humble existence as the overseer of the estate. He's about his daily work, but apparently running from the director. <br /> <br /> The horror builds slowly; A dead cat here, John Carradine, who enters a grave, eventually ends in seven, seven murders. (At least there is truth in advertising.) It's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that a movie was made above him. How was the poor faith knowing that the devilish Tibetan fever would really work? See it, you can't just spin on the dress of Satan and expect him to lie down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says an autopsy on The House of Seven Corps.
