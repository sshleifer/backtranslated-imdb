Basically, take the concept of every Asian horror ghost movie and smash it in one and get this movie. The story goes as follows: a lot of college kids get voices from their own phones that predict their deaths. There are a few ss going on with spirits. If you've seen an Asian ghost movie, it's not scary. This movie was disturbing because it was very clickable. It's the same bull, different movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are put in a very Ring-esquire situation, so it's not something we haven't seen in the past. However, the two headaches did a solid job. <br /> <br /> As far as gore, there's not much to do. We get a cool ride that includes an arm turning off (I don't know how to explain it differently), but it's cut off so you see nothing but the final result. You sometimes see blood, including the disarmed arms and a zombie (it looks really cool, I may add it), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The scarecrows in the movie are few and scattered, and it's not really scary. You will sometimes get scary images, but it's not enough for me to consider scary. It's nothing but Ringu, Ju-On, or Dark Water, and neither of them frightened me. It's really the downfall of this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it doesn't deliver the frights, it's just not that good. <br /> <br /> As far as directing is concerned, Takashi Miike has done pretty well. work. He was tamed in this movie compared to his past movies, but he still portrays much of his jumble in which he became known. Many of the images were much like Miike (including a scene with a lot of dead fetuses), and the last 15 - 20 minutes were more Miike than the rest of the movie. Still, the film is flawed by its unoriginality. <br /> <br /> I just recommend it to people who are big on Asian horror movies (though you can, I highly recommend) or great Miike fans. Warning to those who want to come to Miike, this is NOT his best job. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 because it's just mediocre. Perhaps if it was released 4 or 5 years ago, it might be a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd really like to hear Asian horror movies b. How come if this is an Asian horror movie, is it automatically supposed to be good here (USA)? Many of these movies are the equivalent in Japan that Scream, Urban Legends, and I know what you did last Saturday were here in the 90's. If you saw one, you saw them all. And many of these movies are too much on frightening and imagery that if it's not the frills they make up, then they're just not that good, and nothing will change it. More Asian horror movies have to be more than Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two movies that don't scare or scare you, at least they have good stories, acting, direction, cinematography, and more to support them . . Two movies that are not just big horror movies, but good movies in general. More Asian horror movies should be like this instead of the clich√©, "A ghost just wanted to be found, so it was going to kill people through their phone / video band / home / electric appliance / waterpipes / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc. "
