Trying to compare or represent this "swill" as something "Hitchcockian" is an out-of-out attempt to trick Hitchcock fans into wasting $ 7 on this movie ... Poor performance Poor story Poor writing. <br /> <br /> No real tension, no excitement. You've been waiting for the weakness of this movie for the big payout or even a discount. You keep thinking, what it's about. <br /> <br /> And please, enough with the move to make "alternative lifestyle" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can't recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention how bad the acting is? Williams did a better job than Peter Pan and "Mork". But it was much more innocent times ..................
