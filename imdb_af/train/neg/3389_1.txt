I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway. God knows how many times and feels the passion, despair and joy come from this lively theater experience. Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine "Chorus" for the screen, but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is blunt - this should answer your question. There are a few shows that are made simple to be alive - with an audience. But Richard Attenborough, fresh from the music work of "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle" eventually filed the film, which had little bearing, but no parable with the stage performance. Terrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Big songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was wrong. People who couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy "Landers" woman who couldn't sing, perform or dance - I think she just finished Ghandi's wife. The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday seem to be nothing more than a flash of "Flashdance" and nothing works. I was amazed at how something so sounded and emotionally drained to nothing. If you really like this show and it comes back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think the long-running musical event "A Chorus Line" is about this movie.
