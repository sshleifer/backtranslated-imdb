I just put it at GenCon because it was quiet and I could swallow. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Cat? WTF? Was the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda, or something? <br /> <br /> Truly, a piece of barren garbage. The characters were stereotypical without meaning (I think ...) and wood, most of them seemed to be autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so cut, I refused the authors. <br /> <br /> I'm confused about how anyone can find it worthwhile. , serious. I only give it 3 out of 10, because to be 2 or 1, it must be five hours or more Kelly LeBrock.
