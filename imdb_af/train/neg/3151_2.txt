"It had to be you" is another sign that Hollywood is out of ideas. This photo is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer, became the author. When Charlie's fiance goes out of town, he's stuck with all the wedding planning. He spent a week in a fancy hotel and met Anna Penn, a teacher who just happened to marry. The two quickly become friends and assemble their separate weddings. That's when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie ripens off every romantic comedy ever made and just waits at the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge really give mediocre performances just making this movie, the more dreary to watch.
