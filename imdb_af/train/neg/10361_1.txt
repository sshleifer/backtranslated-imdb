This ABC straight-to-TV failure does absolutely no right to the brilliant fantasy story that a Wrinkle in Time is. Mrs. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world, like no writer in front of her. This novel, the first in her quartet, is a beautiful application for life, the universe and the time itself. Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand. The unshakable morals are common in the book. This movie adaptation can only be seen as a mockery of me. L'Engle's artwork. Honestly, what do they think? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is soft and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and almost every magical feature of the novel is lost. It was a horrible attempt to put this book on the screen. I sincerely hope that a new, dignified director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) will one more day make an effort to bring this book to the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, false and inexpensive motel room art that has no ground and has absolutely no impact on its hearing.
