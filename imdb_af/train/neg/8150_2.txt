If you want an unforgettable and pretty amusing hour or so, it's right to see it. It's not that bad, really. Yes, it is more logical than I have described it and may tax the patience of people - as I have to admit - which tends to throw things on the TV, but it is funny anyway. Just because it's not always INTENSIONALLY funny, you don't have to drop it. <br /> <br /> But if you read the book - or any other books by Brookmyre - then you would probably best avoid it. I read them all and when I first looked, I despised it. I threw it away in detail and on a large length on another site. The TV plot is almost irrelevant to that of the book and only serves to indulge many faithful (and racial) Brookmyre fans. <br /> <br /> Best advice ...? Look at this, then read the book and only make your comparisons and submit your judgment.
