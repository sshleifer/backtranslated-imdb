And how many actors can he include for his own neurotic, compulsive, new-Yorker persona? In this film, Woody is played by Will Ferrell, who is graciously less direct personalized than the one that Kenneth Branagh did in "Celebrity". It's an annoying repetitive story now: nebbishy, ​​a neurotic man with a girlfriend or girlfriend falls in love with a Shiksa queen who projects all sorts of perfection. Everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in the great Manhattan neighborhood. All of them consistently show expensive, exclusive restaurants where all characters engage in fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy. There is always a trip to the Hamptons, after which the nebbishy main character on sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to disease, and then the main character has been found guilty of his desire for the Shiksa queen, but in any case follows her succeed, sometimes fail, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a tired formula, and prove that Allen isn't really a big movie artist. He looks just like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20-year-old who plans to tell the same boring old stories again and again.
