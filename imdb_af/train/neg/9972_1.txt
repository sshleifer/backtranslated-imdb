PROBLEM KIND is one of the worst movies I've seen in the past decade! It's a bad movie about a cruel boy adopted by two parents, but later in trouble. That Junior can drive Grandpa's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can set a room on fire! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A successor is an even worse lot. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of **** I give it.
