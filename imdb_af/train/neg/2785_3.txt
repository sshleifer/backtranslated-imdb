I know some movies (I mean: European films), which are very bad movies, are regarded by some "critics" as a big movie just because they are non-American. I saw the 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and noticed that it was selected for some major festivals. Don't let it fool you! Unless you are one of those people who likes such sensible movies, and call it good art afterwards, skip it! The film features one hilarious scene after another (a similar Italian movie has jumped into my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only boring, like some other oddly priced films, but they are almost like camps. I mean, let's see it, the acting is terrible (I mean: soap opera level), the story has no surprise (it was done endlessly before and linked several story lines: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, GAME ON HEART, only much better), not a realistic character in it (some real freak-seeing along the way, watch the hilarious zombie-like daughter), and so on. <br /> <br /> As if that's not enough, The movie is 135 min. (count it!) long, and at the end the director opens his gaze of sentimentality. After a movie with such hilarious bad dialogue and scenes made public on the preview screening, so much incompetence laughs. Well, this is an insult to the movie, and only gets high ratings because it is in another language, in this case Spanish. Strange world in which we live ... 3/10
