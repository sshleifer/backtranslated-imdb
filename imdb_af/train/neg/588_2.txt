I am obliged to write an overview of this IMAX feature as a way to warn others to save your money. Almost any episode of Desmond Morris's "The Human Animal" or David Suzuki's "The Nature of Things" could have presented the material. Not only does the director not use IMAX's incredible 65 to 70mm film stock and giant display screen. Everything on the screen is extremely unimportant, given the accessibility of such programs mentioned earlier. Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster, and their cousin and cousin. We follow them for an interim forty minutes while they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we access screens in the human digestive tract and learn about babies' natural dive reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most graduate graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic Heather? Give Us Avoid This Movie At All Costs. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I suggest that the beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
