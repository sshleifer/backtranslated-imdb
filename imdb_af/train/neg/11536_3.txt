Well, where do you start here? Straightheads offer me some dilemma. Coming from Italy in 1975, this movie was directed by Ruggero Deodatto and David Hess died. Then I will pick it up faster than Labrador on a summer day drinking water. While Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy paying homage to the grindhouse theater elsewhere, Dan Reed produced a photo of his own in England, and on the same budget as Rodriguez would have had to turn Rose McGowan's leg. a machine gun. Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo, let me call the 'numbers': <br /> <br /> 1. Rich, high flying career quiz meets a bit rough from the wrong side of the songs in an undeniable way and get the hots just as relentlessly for him. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Free shots from the high flying career woman in different states of nudity. Look. <br /> <br /> 3. Complicated and highly unlikely plot development that contains characters exclusively for doing what they do and which cannot be imagined to exist outside the scenes. Look. <br /> <br /> 4. Unnecessary graphic rape scene committed by a gang of males, with no noticeable depth of personality or background, except that they are there to do rape. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to complete it all. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Plotwise, Straightheads are pretty basic things: Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a festival at a country run by her boss. On their way home, they upset three locals in a Landover who are taking revenge by giving Dyer a good shoeing and gang rape from Anderson. The couple then agreed to get their revenge. So far, such "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the Edge of the Park", "Spit On Your Grave", etc. A few reasons: I think the first time I like Gillian Anderson in the thrown prima facie can expect me better, but this is the complete lack of honesty here than most of most. <br /> <br /> Because when someone sat down to watch Hess and his wife terrorize women and murder their men during that 70's. Then they always know exactly what they are getting - low budget quickies that are just designed to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. Terrifying and killing the delicacies, the delicacies turn the tables on the bad things and kill them back, and everyone goes home and they want to see some nasty violence hit and safe knowing that the world order is recovering is. <br /> <br /> As author and director, however, Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads has much more to say about the condition of the human psyche than that and desperately tries to film his film with a philosophical depth that simply isn't there no. . For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to take revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is an object of desire for the two men with whom he hangs. When Anderson meets him face-to-face, he stresses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two friends would take their daughter's attention away !!! The accidental and boring way in which Reed dropped this little revelation in the plot is simply jaw. It's almost as if he expects that this simple reference to pedophilia will be enough to throw the audience's moral compass into overdrive and let them think about the cinema. To make sure we get it, at this point we are once shown the rape order, apparently from the attacker's view and his concern for his daughter, but Reed ensures that we get more shots. Anderson's handcuffed and raped the car's car. Don't cry out in it. <br /> <br /> After telling his reasons to rape her, Anderson ties him over a table, ties the business side of a sniper rifle (complete with adult silencer, only if somebody doesn't. to pull the trigger and Dyer (who does not have such moral qualities) said it was over, Dyer argued differently and their moral dilemma was presented as something Wittgenstein and Russell discussed in their rooms in Cambridge over tea and cakes It is almost unshakable in its ludicrous. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Mrs Anderson acts on her intestines throughout the film. She clearly wants to leave Scully far behind and bless her, she certainly does; " One wonders what Mulder made of his then partner, who put down a lick on the side of the road and then sodomized a man with a gun - Dyer, on the other hand, did what he did in virtually every movie he made so far - that is, playing a gor blimey guv cockney type cha pepper with a roguish grin, a miserable line of patter and a face most people will never get tired of punching. This is especially true of the final scene, after which Dyer spilled into cold blood after the death of his attackers. Dyer looks at the camera, which I am sure is a look of existential anxiety that invites us to treat the handler with sympathy and the moral scandal he had to overcome. Instead, it's much more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy, who looked at the camera after Stan had landed another good debris. By the way, sum this picture together well.
