This movie should not be watched as it had to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make it a repetition of the classic Bollywood movie Sholay, but after experiencing problems with the original makers decided to continue with the project and ... I left all the good parts of the movie (acting , script, songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and shoot the movie just because he already employs the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making films such as Rangeela, Satya and Company he drew a Coppola (Godfather) upon us; What do you think is RGV? Anyway, the story, though difficult to follow, is almost like the old shoay. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, shoay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay, sholay). Both "bad but funny" friends first help a policeman a bad man. Later in the film, now retired cop hire them as personal security and security from the hands of a most popular Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. If you didn't watch Bollywood movies, the Good Parents finally win. There I only saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
