Don't just bother. I thought I'd watch a movie with great excitement and action. <br /> <br /> But it's getting boring and extremely predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the movie you have some social drama and all the tension is lost because it slows down the speed. By the end it gets better, but not really good. I think the director just took this movie too seriously. In such a movie even if you don't care about the plot, you want at least a good action. I almost got rid of the middle / main part of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
