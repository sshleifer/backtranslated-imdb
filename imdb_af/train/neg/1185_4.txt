Another variation and improvisation on the well-known and beloved children's story, La Bee (1975), aka The Beast, tries to think (in a lot of graphics and which may seem offensive and disturbing, but rather rather stupid and comical) , which is actually amused between Beauty and the beast I am amused by many reviews and remarks that look too deep in this movie. I will not go so far as to say that this is a serious and obscure exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I won't even call it a horror-erotic movie. It's more of the parody about all the genres it touches or calls, although it has shocking moments in all departments that will probably stay in your memory. <br /> <br /> The long (far too long) scene between an Aristocratic young woman and the so-called scary but the nicest I've ever seen in the cinema with truly impressive ... anatomy is on the Clavichord music from Scarlatti and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed aloud about the exaggerated details of the meeting. The morale of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is: Who is the target audience for the movie? For an erotic picture it is too verbose; For an art movie - it has too many shattering scenes of pure madness and I will say a sudden end. IMO, the movie creator doesn't mean it should be a serious drama. As a parody of art house / horror / erotica, it is funny and definitely original. Keep a good laugh and try not to look for a deep understanding. This story of the inquisitive beauty and the lustful animals is definitely not recommended for child-watching. The opening scene that can shock an unprepared viewer far beyond the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on Discovery Channel for the program "In the World of Animals - Mating Habits and Rituals of Horses".
