It's a poor movie, but I have to give it a lead. In this one. Francine Forbes. She seemed to be the least and I personally thought she was cute. Too bad she just appears in another movie in the database. In addition, the film is filled with ridiculous gore and fake deaths. People are stabbed and GUSH likes 2 liters of blood! But, if you like to watch poor horror movies, I strongly recommend this one.
