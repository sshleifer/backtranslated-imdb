Things I learned from the list. <br /> <br /> A proper cinematographer, a hot girl who can act and Malcom McDowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster doesn't give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even when he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really?!", Malcom McDowell is still trying. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs acting classes <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punishes me by paying $ 5.50 to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie, you don't need an end. Leave everything inexplicable, unresolved insignificant enough so that the audience falls asleep before the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> Your little girl can sing you back to life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs active classes. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you when you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> Excuse will not be accepted.
