Take: <br /> <br /> 1. A well-known play <br /> <br /> 2. A director with his own ideas using <br /> <br /> 3. A copy of the stage design of a popular theater production of the play mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. an actor for the head - who has no sense of the role he plays. And you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von DÃ¤nemark" <br /> <br /> I listened to the radio game of "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was so disappointed. I was hoping that the filmed version would be better, that Schell would at least have a body language to underline what he was saying - nothing. Then the set ... the minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but usually I like it when there is just enough on the stage to make clear what the institution and nothing else is. Oh, it's on a stage, in a theater. It won't work in a movie based on a play that actually has credible institutions. That the idea for the set was copied from the theater production in which Schell had already played the Hamlet ... let's say it's the only thing to complain about ... I wonder how Schell's part of Hamlet is everywhere got first place. and how someone can allow him to play Hamlet a second time. If you have the choice to watch any of the sixty films based on "Hamlet", you shouldn't watch this one unless you're a masochist, or a lot of hardcore, or have fun on untouched actors.
