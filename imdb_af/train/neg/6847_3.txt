It was a movie I always wanted to see when released. The promotions were catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the movie is not so good <br /> <br /> It has many flaws. <br /> <br /> The start is good and until the murder goes all well, but the movie falls flat when the romance track between Govinda and Karisma starts and the songs that follow. <br /> <br /> Then the strife over Govinda and Tabu falls in love, let's doubt and fail and then. How does Govinda come in a rich criminal from a poor village? <br /> <br /> The last playback was also extended and also the whole clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra disappeared Music is okay, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> <br /> Govinda tries to play a negative role and does it very well, although he overdo it too often Sometimes Karisma is good, but sometimes irritates her cries. Taboo is okay. Nirmal Pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest. Y
