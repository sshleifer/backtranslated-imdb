"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of movies that contain strong, sometimes notable performances and high scores, but unfortunately they are destroyed and delayed by a dark plot and very little to interest the audience. It is star Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a spiritual institution, whose life becomes uneasy because of family problems and a little ridiculous and overworking conflict that doesn't really look like. <br /> <br /> The plot is over. It's time for the institution to get new curtains for the library windows. One old woman wants her curtains over them, but many patients want to make their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unceasingly perverse conflict breaks out at the point where lives are in danger and families are falling apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would happen between very young children. <br /> <br /> Questioning the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one might wonder if just a real lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast next Widmark is made up of other great actors, many of them Academy Award nominees and winners. And sometimes there is a moment in the movie that works brilliantly, but it always excludes the silly plot of window curtains. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone curtains and so the film is delayed. Many of the tasks are long and complete with one camera view, which meets the slow pace and lack of interest. <br /> <br /> In a short analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognizable film and it becomes obvious. why basically the viewers as soon as the plot comes in focus, doing it fairly quickly. It just doesn't seem so much fun to watch and I tell you it's not much fun to watch.
