Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack and Ripley, the super government computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, follows him because he (by hacking) borrowed money from his nearest neighbor's bank account to pay for a class drive to play chess in Philadelphia. The neighbor neighbor, whose computer has determined Will, has relatives in the Middle East who send money to their neighbor's bank through their bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to call missile attacks. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s. Well, the electronic industry has worked so much more with these days. Make sense. So the movie sparkles us with fantastic CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, Ripley's predecessor, is found operational, we are left to watch computer against computer and people cry, hope, pray. oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more cringing hope things are going their way. In other words, we are now experiencing a movie made for television, and that is Oh Hum Time. Return to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie. It's much better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask ourselves: Are our computers too intelligent, where will they rule us one day? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Necessity: No. Language: No.
