I was p *** ed when I couldn't see this one when it looked at the Philly Film Fest last year. When I saw it on the cable tonight, I reminded it as soon as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well, let's trace a little back, because I've given you another plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his way of life is. Give Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray was hammering and asking Sean to leave the man they followed Sean. And it goes from there. This leads me back to the question being asked. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the build up was pretty good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran. But it's nowhere as violent as I did to believe, and somewhere alongside the movie, the ball not only dropped, but fumbled and moved in the other direction. I know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without spoiling the movie. But it is unnecessary to say this has happened. The end does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good like "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My Degree: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Filter both explicit <br /> <br /> Eyecup: Kari Wuhrer shows her ta-bag in a fantasy and then in the next more ta-bag and it blows off and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
