Oh, what a derogatory movie! In Los Angeles, the focal point of the universe of the Hollywood movie makers POV, this movie is trying a deep social commentary on contemporary American fears. Stereotype, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds crossroads in their everyday lives. The plot is unfounded and desultory. Many imaginative plot controversies keep the film going, such as: a slideshow, an abandoned baby left behind in the weeds, a gang of thugs who intimidate a lawyer, a man passing through the night sky over the city flying, a child at the summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, the one constant is the generous help of sociological "insights" given through dialogue, as characters compare comparisons about their life experiences. One character tells another: "If you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke our people are ... those rocks laugh at me, I can tell me and my worries actually humorous for the Grand Canyon ". <br /> <br /> And explaining another character about its meaning: "There is a gorge in this country, an ever-widening abyss between the people who have things and the people who do not have ... it's like this big hole in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what's poured out ... is an outburst of anger, and the rage creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the terribly unnatural and forced dialogue, apart from the level, smarmy characters, apart from the dumb plot, the tempo of the story is particularly slow. Acting is uninspired and perfunctories. The play of the film is smug and self-satisfied, in the screaming contempt for viewers. <br /> <br /> It was a movie project approved by Hollywood suits, depicting themselves as almighty gurus. They think their movie will be an exciting revelation for our humble, unconscious film-goers, keen to learn about the real meaning of American social change.
