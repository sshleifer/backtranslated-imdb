I'm not doing what the other review was talking about. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, but I don't think there was one decent search girl in it. No, it's just cheesy, poorly done, Ed Wood-style science fiction schlock. And it's bad. I can't even tell you how bad it is. I saw it on the cable late at night, and I was in shock. The fact that this movie has ever been released is an insult to us all. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally handicapped, the special effects were a joke, and the pace was slow. For me, the music is above all else. A monkey can write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Don't rent this thing, but if you ever see it on the cable, watch it. You'll be surprised at how bad a movie can be.
