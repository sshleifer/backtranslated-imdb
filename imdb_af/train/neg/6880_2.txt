I was excited to hear someone making a documentary about what it was like to be Puerto Rico. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered why she might know what it really is to be Puerto Rico. As far as I know .... she was a Nuyorican. Well anyway, I was anxious about watching my popcorn. I realized for 10 minutes that my initial fear was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of what it means to be Puerto Rico. This "documentary" is more a one-handed, very personal account of what it is like to be a Nuyorican .. and everything it entails. She (like most Nuyoricans I know) has a disapproved, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How could they not. They live here.) Yes, everyone is proud. As they should be! But many do not know the input of true culture, history and political background or language for the most part. It all became very clear with her participation in the Vieques issue. Regardless of my personal conduct is about this issue. At least I know how hell the fight is. There she was arrested for something she didn't know much about and just participated because it was a "Puerto Rican cause". I really don't understand how she's not ashamed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, consider it a partial version of a woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Do not use it as a gospel. Many of them are not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This movie is not and should never be the basis of other information for other Nuyoricans. Instead, just step into more information, learn and debate what is reality. Not just the one coming out of this woman's eyes.
