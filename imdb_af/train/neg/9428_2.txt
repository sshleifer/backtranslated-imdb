I don't usually take the time to comment what few people will read about movies that will see little. But in this case, I feel I have to warn everyone who might consider wasting time on it. I just watched it just five minutes ago. It's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The acting is terrible, a plot is non-existent, and production values ​​are at its best poverty. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There's just something this movie can save for any horror fan's purpose - more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times it takes place is outside the screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbed when it happens - especially the end tones - it's simply not enough. The movie is just too long because it is minimal content, too heavy dialogue, and therefore almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with space to save, three teenage girls go irresponsibly and consciously out of a remote area, where more than 20 girls have been abducted and murdered before. Of course, their car breaks down and they live in an old boring home inhabited by three crazy people - one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually killed, one by one, off-screen, after what looks like an eternity of boring, slow pace. As I said, the only one that is worth looking at is once. Please don't buy it or just rent it for it and don't be fooled as I was by the deceptive goat art and movie description. Save your money and your time.
