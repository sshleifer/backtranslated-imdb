It may have been made for hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen for years. The best thing about the whole DVD will be the case! I am surprised that people have taken the time to make such a mess and spend more money on it, I'm glad I just rented. I think the true fans of this movie will probably have to be sadistic and gothic to take care of it without having any CGI or any other effect on it. I hope Alex Chandon has learned a lighting lesson and SFX to make a better movie. The future, that is, if he is still in work. <br /> <br /> Notes to buyers it's extremely disappointing, don't buy it!
