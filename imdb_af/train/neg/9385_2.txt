The "Trivia" page on IMDb claims the filmmakers have protested because this movie was cut by the studio to simplify the plot. If so, that effort was a total failure, as it is one of the most incoherent stories I've ever seen in a movie. I'd love to see it before the plot was 'simplified'. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see Warren with so little character to go on, even though he can't do anything with the turbulent stuff. It is interesting to surrender Caron in the 70's instead of her Hollywood glamor clothes and persona, but it is sad to see that she is having a hard time drinking through this drunk-to-her producer man. She would actually come together later and marry the director, instead - who, you will notice, never targeted anything, but just got 1st or 2nd A.D. works in the television from here. It calls you enough here. <br /> <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have an automatic love for American movies of this period, and this role gives perspective to Oates' otherwise fantastic 1971 output (Two - Lane Blacktop, the hired hand ). But the "1940s detective in the '70s, L.A., like fish-out-of-water." theme, which is the only thing the film really has to say, is being sold out too heavily. A similar theme will be handled much more effectively two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye. And as he plays Oates on a hard-hitting man for three years, he will give Alfredo Garcia his last performance in Bring Me. If you haven't seen it, don't waste your time with it!
