Just too many holes in this movie are enjoyable and a bizarre almost Hollywood-like end that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (it's not a spoiler, because you'll never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You should also be thick on all sorts of politically correct undertones. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly confronted and unilateral. I did not understand why the writer behaved in such an unacceptable way as the local black community, is he / she racist? <br /> <br /> A bitter movie. See if you really want to be annoyed by holes in the plot and would like to debate all the things that may or may not be supposed to. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, filming and acting are excellent.
