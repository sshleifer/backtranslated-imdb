First, I'm not American or Middle East. Secondly, I have no religion. The closest thing to a religion I have is sports and movies. Henceforth I believe that I would best serve to give an opinion of neutrality and free of bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are a total shame. This horrific event has to be used to commemorate all innocent people who have been murdered by a few "barbaric and uncivilized morons. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loach's Segment Certainly, we are all sad that this man had a hard life in his country, but what did it do to the innocent victims of 2001 ? Two mistakes don't make right?! Anyway, this movie must have a caption for those who are having trouble listening to a partially disjointed Chilean English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The biggest Struggle is Youssef Chahine's segment, obviously having trouble with logic, justifying the murders because America is a democracy and because some Americans voted politically, all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions t made their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this man the right one? Some Americans disagree! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know which religion is practiced; and majority don't know the right political issues behind the scenes. # # # Mr Chahine, the reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from all over the world. The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, assistants and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we should not go over our lives, because a few people think everyone should choose a side or a religion. We are considered fair play for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. Another filmmaker who uses this opportunity to push their own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of the "I, I, I." Sometimes it is about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political leader. Of course, they want money from the international community by emphasizing their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This movie denies the memory of the "Sept. 11, 2001" victims. <br /> <br /> The best thing for this is the TRASH CAN.
