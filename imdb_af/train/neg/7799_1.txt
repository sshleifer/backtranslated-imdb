What happened in God's name? How about creating what is almost a cheap knock-off from Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone ... anyone or even a dollar profit? But especially, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Filter explicit Pestilence is arranged by a lunatic named Andreas Schnaas, specializing in terrestrial gore films like Goblet or Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain curses in the titles. In the Gore section, this one is not much different from the rest. Although, the level of inefficiency ... well, land distribution. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is stingy, think about it. <br /> <br /> Being too specific with the story will be a waste of time. An accident with chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat life. The concept has never been treated like that. The gore effects are a whole new layer. Just a Z-degree nightmare. I can't tell if it was originally meant to be funny, but I doubt if the English dubbing was very true to the original script, but more strange things happened. The whole thing just reminds me of a lap-on-video introduction to a Troma movie, except that it lasts a hell much longer. <br /> <br /> I just saw one movie that was worse than that, The buyer. <br /> <br /> As proof that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I strongly recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think you have no standards in what you're looking for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence a try, but you're warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it right through. But if everything is all that you are here for, then you can have this one stomach. Other than that, no atmosphere, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show a little pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 7/5/09: After some views of Zombie '90, I had a change of heart, or I think I'm getting it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so remember the harsh words, though, extreme pestilence only earns one star.
