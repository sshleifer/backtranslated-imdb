I would have classified this movie a minus 10, but unfortunately it was not offered. <br /> <br /> Why I didn't go out of this movie in the first five minutes, I can't say. I had to go with my instinct and left out immediately !! Unfortunately, several people in our theater did not follow it. <br /> <br /> The story didn't have all the criteria for a movie. NO plot. Awful acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I could never see another movie he was in. Not a single relationship in the story went on. I had the tazer scene. Too bad it didn't shock meat in the senselessness of the plot. Someone has to be the author and director of this movie tazer!
