Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and friendly, he was comfortable and looked like well-educated and intellectual. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like dumb with affected gestures and imitation. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was someone else! Don't believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after the movie "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Facts" by Golovanov . I was shocked by a tiring scenario, poorly acting and manufacturing, and a lot of unreality of the "Space Race". <br /> <br /> The movie is the boring version of well-known historical facts in Russia. A lot of interesting familiar facts from space projects have not been demonstrated. Some facts and details are distorted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was not a prisoner (released in 1944) and in 1940 he was not already in the colony prison gold mine, but in special prison design bureau. Korolev was the designer in the prison design bureau and he was not buried dead dead. But in the film, Korolev worked as a grave after 1940 (because the prison sentence had shoulder straps on uniform). IMHO, the authors of the film have no sound knowledge about this part of history and cannot make interesting movies.
