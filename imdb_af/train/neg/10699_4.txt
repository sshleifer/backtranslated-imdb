Yes, I went through the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, it's all lame excuses, but they're the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10. I have seen worse movies, but this one is definitely right in the old trash of bad movie movie - poor essay, poor acting, bad lighting and special special effects. <br /> <br /> The storyline, which never makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, dad, mom and girl - which I assume viewer is supposed to identify, all three were annoying and annoying. You just want the dark side to get each one of them. <br /> <br /> Dad is a cook whose hobby cars are. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who also owns a creature he bought in the "mysterious" Orient. Rubin holds it in a cakes and refers to it as "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> In the course of the movie Darkling is explained as about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a human being, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the devil. So choose which one of those explanations fits your fiction - because trust me, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> The Darkling's main problem seems to be having a companion - it gets a human companion - and then he's finally dissatisfied with man. This, of course, leads to enormous wealth, followed by a disaster, for the person who turns on Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - it only leads to a very long, boring movie. <br /> <br />
