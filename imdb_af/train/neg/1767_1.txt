One can ask why? The characters snarl, scream and chew the scenery for no apparent reason, except that someone wanted to make a movie in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is it the right one? Is forgotten in the cop / alien-man / loving-father-or-cute-blonde-girl role. The story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes of the adventure films discarded in the last three years. ellen pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that looks like the energy from every scene she is in is sucking. Her true stage series is shown when she is taking off her blouse, as the movies are taken care of from one to the other. Unfortunately, directing seldom goes bad enough to be camp or a parody. It's all just clich√©, known in all respects. The director threw his own daughter as the provisional brat, probably because no respectable agent could allow a client to ruin a career by being such a lame, confronted and uninteresting film. The only lift here is the theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time.
