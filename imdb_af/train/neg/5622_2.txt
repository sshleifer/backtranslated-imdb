OK, besides the psychedelic background image, was the information presented here well. The music I could have done (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit this movie at all.) <br /> <br /> Regarding the content of the movie, the director often brings up -The pagan perspective on Christ's existence and an exciting comparison of the acts and events of Christ's life against the lives of mythological figures / gods such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he brings up the chronology of Christianity's origins and offers an "ok" case, but not one that bleeds me away. <br /> <br /> If the director kept the facts and continues with them, this movie would be good. At this point in the film, however, it disintegrates into a group of personally satisfying attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" and a Christian private school that the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal (who, during the course of the case, revealed that the director was under false pretenses), I felt that the director was acting childishly. He asked good questions, but like the film itself, the interview in an attack on this particular private school's rules, not Christianity, crumbled. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're just interested in some information, check out the first 30 minutes or so and then turn it off.
