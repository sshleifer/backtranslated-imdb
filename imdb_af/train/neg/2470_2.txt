Over the years I have seen many horror performances, such as Nightstalker, who dealt with the Wendigo legend. I then looked for a wild spirit that made it possible to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man I was wrong. The whole movie creates this sense of happening that will be frightening and horrible, but then delivers a very simple story of revenge and murder over the loss of property. Terribly scary - not! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It is getting harder and harder to believe that anything Hollywood is proposing about scary movies, as they seldom go through anything original and Greek. What idiots pay for such a fake movie to be made? Go back to the drawing board and do something useful with the millions of dollars you have to throw.
