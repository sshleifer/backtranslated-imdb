It sounded like a very interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis, occult, government conspiracies. I expected a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something quite different, more psychologically, more from David Lynch. This was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the trouble is decisive. Andrienne Barbeau's character begins with a bit of grief and scare. She does it just as well, even at her age, though she definitely tried. The actor throws as the boy believes it was a comedy. Most of the other actors also thought it was a camp movie, or at least acted like it, rather than just being strange. The only one I thought really did well was the daughter, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Much is pacing. It starts very slowly. So slow you can be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes compulsory for a while when you come to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath. But soon afterwards, it all becomes a mess. Some of these were deliberate, but many of them were just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The right problem, it's simply not a pleasant movie to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the characters are nice. Excessive use of images and sets. Some movies you see characters are tortured. This is the viewer doing it. It does have some creepy moments, especially the creepy Nazi paintings and the credits, but the rest of the movie is usually just tiring.
