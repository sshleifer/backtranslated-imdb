First, I want to apologize for my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL hardcore fan, but I didn't like the movie at all. Live Feed, however, sowed great time! I've never seen a gore movie with great acting, but hey, who's surprised? The play in Live Feed was ... well, not there! I've seen it since it was a school project or something. Okay, but not by students in the media or acting school. It was NO class! And what about the story? A very sad rip-off at Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic tortures that are supposed to turn your stomach and make you cold? It was the most disappointing thing about the hole movie! Short, fast and NO edge. More like a performance rather than a torture. Okay, there were buckets of blood, but it didn't even look right. The battle and violence reminded Braindead as Hostel or any of the Saw movies. And Braindead was fun! Okay, I laughed a few times on Live Feed, but it was more than disappointing than pure fun! <br /> <br /> So, instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed, watch anything else!
