Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous. Not painful to look with your significant other? I apologized to the whole movie for my boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unsuitable for this, especially with Vanessa doing the ridiculous brash American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lips awkward girl that she was in my so-called life. She still has to push her in any way. Meisie, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only saving parts of this movie, she was five minutes on the screen, and I swear to God, she came out of the movie screen and woke me up. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also good in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a well-shot movie, it was very nice, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's just pretty pathetic when a movie featuring a role of "The greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much. It certainly had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a huge piece. I was glad she died. But that's because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friend - mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD works, evening the movie. You weren't entertaining and you weren't even tempting. I hope the book is better, so it no longer wastes people's time. 10/03
