I saw this movie back at the first scene release, in a straight empty theater. Believe it or not, after watching dozens of movies, this one remains clear in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst I will allow to watch. <br /> <br /> The play is far below the standard found by a random group of drunk high school students and forced to teach their lines. 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while, because each scene hit new lows. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure wore and it just had to be very sad.
