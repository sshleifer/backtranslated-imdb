I'm a big fan of David Lynch. However, this movie was a disappointing experience. Apart from the surrounding background music ?? what really sets the mood of the movie? It lacks almost all the features I got to associate with Lynch's work. The visuals are dull, and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to be of any interest. <br /> <br /> It feels more like a film student who is uncomfortably trying to do a dogmatic movie than the work of an experienced director. I saw many amateur movies with much better camera work, scenery, sound and writing. This film has virtually all artistic features. I feel like I'm watching one of Davids's home videos, made during a weekend trip with friends.
