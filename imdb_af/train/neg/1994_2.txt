Originally released in Christmas 1940, this film was long lost. A very poor copy revived and made in a CD, now for sale. Don't buy it! The movie is indescribably terrible. The casting is poor, the writing is awful, and the direction is terrible. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young is singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie has been deliberately lost.
