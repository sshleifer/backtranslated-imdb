It was the WORST movie I've ever seen! Molly (molly hall) could not act at all! She had no emotion. It was all blah blah as she read from a boring textbook. The clever child and the child who loves food (there are names not worth remembering) was so annoying that it got me. When it ever spoke, it was about scientific thing or food. Mollys Pa did not show enough emotion about his missing daughter. The police officer and Molly's father said the same thing four times. it was just awful. Everything is too much to repeat. Beatrice had something for her because she was so mean. I just wasted a moment in my life watching this movie!
