All these reviewers are on the point. <br /> <br /> It's not just a "so bad, it's good", time extraction, but a real, hilarious, <br /> <br /> CHECK the white furry monster type thing ! <br /> <br /> KNOW YOURSELF AT Thom Christopher's "acting tissue" acting! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISB! at the solid sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people who participate in 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' are not really aware that they are appearing in a movie! <br /> <br /> Fact! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to find a copy a few weeks later to make sure it was so terrible. It is. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all John Derek's movies, it's really the Citizen Kane or Trash.
