Let's look at it - if you've hired a STDVD successor of a forgotten 80's jewel and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary prosecutions that the DVD market has so easily filled. Movies like these don't need spoilers because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The "plot" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd love girl; Nerd is accidentally involved in the Top Secret Government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl are prosecuted by government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet an important old guy who dies at the main point in the "movie"; nerd and girl are caught; the top secret government computer is crazy; nerd is appointed to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beat Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer of the first Wargames movie; nerd save that day; nerd is laid. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> The acting, essay, effects, score and cinematography are what you expect - B grade. Some familiar faces are here, and if you're not a mega-fan of Colm Feore, avoid this one. Granted, the movie won't make you foolish to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you're looking for cheap STDVD successors, you're right at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was also involved in some "masterpiece" that he couldn't even do for five seconds in this one. But can you blame him?
