This TV movie shows that bad movies exist. The only reason I saw it was that it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played and we see that behind the scenes look basically nothing. With the many stars in this movie it made no difference. I really don't know why I watched it.
