I'm not sure it's a spoiler; Maybe it's a public service. If you are one of those focused on immediate gratification that surpasses end credits, you will miss the final line of the end-credit news announcer's vote-over, saying the US has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on World War II on May 7, 1945 to end. . Here are just a few of the problems with this closeness: <br /> <br /> 1) The older viewer has to think about the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLY movies in their minds to fill in the gaping gap between movie events . and this surprising conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person really kicks himself to the fact that they have not watched one of these ACCIDENT-in-space movies created in their own head for free. <br /> <br /> 3) This end credit series of imagined news bulletins can be the first information that some younger viewers are exposed to about World War II, leading them to conclude that George W. Bush is the latest heir to the Nazi throne .
