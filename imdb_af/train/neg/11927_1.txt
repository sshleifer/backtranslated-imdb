Without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. I went to the end, for there must be something here, but no. The plot, when not in clichés, falls to the point of non-existence; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed; characters never develop beyond sketches; set-pieces are clichéd. Worse, in view of his fellow director, photography is just the same. <br /> <br /> Comments elsewhere that elevate it along Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far from the point; Life of the Saints lacks their innovation, let alone their depth and shadow. In short, their craft. A relentless editor can probably turn it off until a decent 30 minutes short, but as it stands, it is a 6th form film project realized on a million pounds scale. rambling and inflated with his own pretensions. The fact that it received funding (surely only because of Rankin's name) while other small films are fighting for cash is depressed for the British film industry.
