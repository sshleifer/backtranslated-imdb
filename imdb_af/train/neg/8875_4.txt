If it's someone's "favorite" movie, they need serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I didn't see the original movie, it's the remake of (a movie of the 1950s), but it should simply be better than this new bastardization. <br /> <br /> A head is kicked out of the army because he is a fringe element, and wind up learning children at a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the chief Daman Wayans ... so the kids are in for a world of annoying, humorous infinity. Can Wayans whip these losers into shape? Can they get him to become a little more human? The movie booms like most Wayans movies do, with just a few sparkling moments. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time, just too little. This cute old man, best known to me as a "Tales from the Crypt" actor, known as Uncle Louis of "Christmas Holiday", shines every moment he is on the screen. It's not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also looks like a cyclist who fits perfectly. I will no longer keep Bam Bam in mind, but I think he has the role of "biker" as far as it can be worn for a military film. <br /> <br /> And then there is the handsome teacher who falls to Major Payne even though he treats the children poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to turn into someone you want to spend time with. She must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which (although it seems stupid, as the movie makes it clear she often comes out of the house). <br /> <br /> Wayans had a bright moment: a dance series where he performed a series of movements (including a very nice "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. This scene was pleasant, but made nothing else, spitting this movie dog. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie seriously. If you want to see a movie, a loser losing helpers, children become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he is a lovely loser, and actually funny. Maybe if Major Payne had a tie, I would feel better, but he didn't. Forget Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do so much better.
