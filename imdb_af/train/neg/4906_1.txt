Well, I don't know where to start. It was clear that it made a TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour, but something before or after it was a paint by the numbers kind of film. <br /> <br /> Talk about bad chemistry among the tow lovers. .. <br /> <br /> I'll go into more depth, but this movie doesn't really deserve it. Degree: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
