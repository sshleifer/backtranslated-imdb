Anyone who wants a sucker for the 1920s jazz, the 1920s, the Charleston, and the ultra-heavy yachts (eg I on all counts) wants to keep this movie. But the sad fact is that it's all there is. The plot is banal and obvious, the play is mostly either terribly or playing past the hallway, and if the whole thing is up there is not much more, but the impression of mirrors and smoke . It's a beautifully made bad movie.
