Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent on my money. It was a wrong choice for all these great stars to devour their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character is depicted in less than inspiring manner. No acting talent shown - just read a portion. Alec can usually play realistic characters, but Gwynyth picked herself badly for an inept part. Annette needs advice on choosing the movies she chooses to play. Like all these great stars that disappointed me about the way they allowed everyone all the talents in a function that leaves much fun in entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads the public to expect great acting in a movie that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion. There was not one moment the cast could portray any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault - whatever.
