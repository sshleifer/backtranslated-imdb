"So, there is this bride you see, and she is killed by this image that falls on her wedding day. Then, a year later, her former fiancee falls in love with a beautiful psychic? then that gorgeous psychic ghost is chased by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to prevent her from stealing her boyfriend? He's it? It'll be hilarious! "Polite chuckling. <br /> <br /> I would like to suggest how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed "Over Her Dead Body", presented his concept for studio executives there at New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how those same corporate big wedges turn right and lighten the project, so Lowell can regulate the film and write the script. <br /> <br /> Because if you think no movie could be Ever so badly sounded like this original point of view, then there is clearly another way of thinking. The only way it worked was if the writer had just gone crazy and changed it into a so-called satirical farce. Instead, to ensure that he delivers a fuzzy, unofficial and warm-hearted romantic comedy, Lowell enters three times boring half-measures to enforce the absurdity in favor of deadly convention. Indeed, "over her dead body" is so thoroughly unsuitable and inappropriate that it is difficult to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every setup, joke and siggag in the movie is flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves apparently aware of their trouble. How else do the half-hearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs explain in their different roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not to blame the actors, some of which have proven their talents in better vehicles in the past (this is especially true with Rudd). But Lowell and those studio execs probably have some splainin to do.
