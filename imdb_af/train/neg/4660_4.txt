At first glance, it gives the impression that it will be a ridiculous blow-up movie, and it contains moments where it moves in that direction. However, the basic story idea is much stronger than can be expected, and is a respected attempt to reflect racial problems in World War II. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and under-employed Billy Dee Williams the best. However, Stephen Boyd just stops turning his bush mustache into an overpowering star twist. <br /> <br /> The naturally low budget leads to contradiction in production values. The places are good, the consequences and action are poor. Imagine if 'Saving Private Ryan' consisted of half of the platoon murdered exactly like Vin Diesel's Caparzo (except that we see the shot because they can't handle effects), then drive Hanks, Damon and Burns shot in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Still, the kidnapping, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their performance, because they are black, and Boyd's racist captain through this, is compelling, as well as the sequels of Turman's character in a magazine of his imagination exploitation if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging digs. <br /> <br /> In short, "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" doesn't quite succeed. But this is a respected failure, not a bad joke. It can be rearranged as a very good movie, and, as it stands, is an interesting effort.
