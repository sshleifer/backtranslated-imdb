I stopped at BB and picked up four zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be cheese, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspected. So I don't expect much. But it must have at least a story. Stories don't cost a thing except time ... apparently they didn't have any time either. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie. Looks like new wave hookers. The picture of the zombie on the front page never appears in the movie. It was absolutely angry to watch and had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> Running time is just 81 minutes, but it feels like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie because she was on another computer on the computer), it sounded like zombie porn. If you think, it sounds a bit ..... but it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that the writer might have done too many things and ultimately made a mess. <br /> <br /> It was finally a free rental and I still felt ripped off. I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb doesn't allow me to use decimals.
