I once thought "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed it in every way I could imagine and some I couldn't. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and everyone involved in creating this cruelty. I won't include a teaser on this movie, I'm not so cruel. I couldn't submit innocent people, like yourself to such a torment. In fact, any discussion of plot regarding this movie is senseless and humiliating. Words I will use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine and inventive. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't see this movie. I beg of you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one person to another, PLEASE. For your own common sense and understanding, DO NOT. Destroy any copies you receive.
