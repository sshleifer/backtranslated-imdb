This is one of those movies you see in the video store you just have to get because it looks just as bad. And indeed, we couldn't take most of it. However, there was very fast forward. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduced the female protagonist (her name somehow shifts my mind at the moment). CRIPES. I've watched a single scene from a movie so many times (I estimate forty or so). And I have never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to point out his loins. I haven't seen the movie a few months ago, but I can't stop laughing if I type. Anyway, the scene is a fitting of shots. Englund rips off the girl's lingerie, Englund drives a horse naked and a mysterious woman who falls a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You have to see it yourself.
