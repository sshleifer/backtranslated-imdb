OK me and a friend rented it a few days ago because we love to keep b-movies, as we do it ourselves. Anyway, the cover contains blood and strange naked girls with patches and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There is just no way to fail this movie! Right? wrong!! It just looks like a waste! There was really no story, the dialogue was terrible (was there anyone? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really had no kind of personality ... The effects were terrible .. and what is this with these long artifacts of scared people running to do nothing. With close proximity to eyes and things? We sat the whole movie waiting for something ... anything to happen ... but no ... "oh, here's the nymphs! Great! Oh ... they kiss ... again ... and now for the violence! OK ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now they are walking around ... and the eyes of the eyes ... again ... oh, Lord Tom Savini! died ... right ... OK, maybe something cool or even interesting will happen .. no oh! Cool! a cut head! The end ... oh crap .. "And finally, since I'm so full of myself .. I'll tell you! Give me a van, six actors, a strange home, Tom Savini, a few naked girls with chicks and buckets of blood and I can make the coolest movie you've ever seen. I made movies with no budget. in two days that have better effects, better acting and better writing than this ... What is this John guy doing? Making cool movies is easy! It could have been so good ... I'm really upset !!
