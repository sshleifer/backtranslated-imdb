The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology - much like Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated fans of the show, no matter what each episode was as a winner. They are the one that shows each individual display 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the display. As a result, I've been reviewing all of the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) for a while because overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While getting many episodes 10, this one gets 3 just because it was bad. The writing was actually shockingly bad. Two people from opposite sides in a great war are seen walking through the entire episode. After a while, it is clear that they are the only two people on earth - as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually the turn at the end makes the episode great - this one killed it!
