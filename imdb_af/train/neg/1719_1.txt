The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most horrible, amateur movies I've ever seen. Arrange right there with Manos, the Hands of the Fate in terms of poor acting, useless direction and kindergarten production values. In this movie, a dormant clay / stop motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hit a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and starts eating on the local hay. In the exciting climax, the creature, described by one local as a gigantic alligator with flippers, traverses a particular mass over the ground to chase its lunch, before a bulldozer stomp it several times and it boredom dies. . Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. One infinite subplot shows a hiccup in a liquor store to buy a $ 4.75 pint of Ripple; Instead of just buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander, shoots at a policeman, rushes to the lake, so he can be eaten by the monster. Unhappy close-ups of the monster show that it is nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There is a fake wizard struggling with an ominous British accent (to make him look more legitimate), two exaggerated redneckbooth landlords, some cheesy "prehistoric cave art" made in the crayons and boring banjo pickin's backdrops. In a painful scene, the fake wizard and his brave wife / girlfriend / accomplice succeed the film for another 4 minutes by exploring how stars can see them in the night sky, even though it is still evident in the daytime. Even at constant fast forward, this moovie hurts and hurts. MooCow says the fumigators are calling, because this cowboy card really goes up! : = 8P
