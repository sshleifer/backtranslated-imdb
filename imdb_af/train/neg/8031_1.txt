The American Humane Society, the source of the well-known disclaimer "No animals was harmed ..." (the registered trademark of the AHA), reviewed the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after a blindfolded horse was forced to jump to his death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the horrific act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this movie for me. I can say that at least the horse did not die in vain, because it was the beginning of the public who woke up to the reckless and terrible pain that animals made for the glory of filmmaking, but I can't help but Don't feel that if the poor animal had a choice, it wouldn't be the way he would have taken!
