I was so excited to see this movie after reading this book this week. My 13 year old son also looked forward to it. I rented it and put it down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This movie has more time off the book than it has been forgiven. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but it appears that he was only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was very flat. <br /> <br /> I realize it was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it was very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas gift, Scrooge takes on the stormy wind tour of the world, where people observe in the darkest conditions still has the light and love of the Christian time. <br /> <br /> I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "Reformed" Scrooge at the end. It was a refreshing depiction. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit was portrayed as a little more baffled and dried up. And Tiny Tim ... oh, don't even make me the beginning of bad child actors ...
