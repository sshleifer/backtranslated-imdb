I was true to my respect for Mr. Glover and me. Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and friends. I have no idea what the movie is about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts. <br /> <br /> It doesn't work well together. It's hooked, and there's little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to watch this movie, based on the liner notes. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money unless you are full-time and just want to get all mr. Glover and Ms. See Goldberg's movies. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend an evening.
