Vovochka is your daily hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the area. With the words of some adult's wisdom he meets along the way, and he finds his difficult ways difficult but worthy to do. Personally, I have found an actor who played Vovochka to sympathize, but changing the tone of the movie will allow most to feel the emotional struggle that Vovochka has when he wants to be good, but bad things still happen. This battle makes the movie a little different from other movies of the same genre, it's the little taste I meant. All in all, I didn't really care for this movie, though it was probably aimed at a younger audience.
