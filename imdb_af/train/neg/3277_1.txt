If you've ever watched the Dukes of Hazard, you know you never have to worry about drugs or cussing or rough behavior seen by young children. If you've seen the movie, you know it's no longer the case! This movie was surprising! Main characters who use drugs and think it's funny and cool are definitely not what I call entertainment. They took a great show and just changed it into garbage. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original performance, now looks and acts like she is on the corner and pays for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out, 15 minutes in the movie I was ready to go. I kept thinking it should get better, but it got worse right now. I wish I never saw this movie. It scraped a good performance and left nothing but terrible taste in my mouth when I was away. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money because it's not just a waste of money, but a waste of 2 hours of your life, you'll never come back!
