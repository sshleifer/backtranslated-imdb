If you look at a little man, you will spend his current time finding out his many plot holes. And it's not a good sign, because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! Imagine laughing at it! But do you want? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the little man is his concept - it is too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoon comedy), so when the hardworking, hassle-free and top jokes kick, they make the whole thing looks ten times thinner than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy," some of you shout. It's true, but it's no excuse for such a dumb plot. I mean, think if you saw a baby with a GREEN MALE, wouldn't you be the least suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random handbag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT admit that Calvin is an adult man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about laughing", you can scream. Well, here's the thing to see, there is hardly a laugh in the little man and it just makes the dumb ass plot more and more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a conviction of suspension, you stick to white chicks because it has at least some decent teachings.
