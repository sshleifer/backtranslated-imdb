This movie is trying hard, but completely missing out on the fun of the 1960s TV series, which I am sure, remember people with love. Although I am 17, I watched the series on YouTube for a long time and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this movie has little right to the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty substandard, and it's not helped by the flat camera work. The writing was also boring and had no sense of wonder and humor. Other films with underhanded dissertations are Home Alone 4, Cat in Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I'll say I kept the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was poorly executed and ran out of steam too early and I'm honestly not sure, that's why it's for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talk suit, despite Wayne Knight's vocal voice. <br /> <br /> But the thing that hurts me most about this movie was that it wasted Christopher Lloyd's talents, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah. , all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels had previously made some good performances, but he didn't have an idea what he was supposed to do, and unfortunately Elizabeth Hurley's character had become so useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and is mostly ignored, and I like the idea that she is the love interest, but unfortunately you see very little of her (not to mention that the monster attack is likely to frighten children rather than surprise them ) just like Wallace Shawn as a kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd makes himself better, and as an actor I love Lloyd a lot (he was in two of my favorite films, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I love Back To The Future), but he got little to do with to work, and had a tendency to persuade many wildlife. <br /> <br /> Overall, as much as I wanted this movie, I was left unobstructed. Instead of having fun, it has become useless and unfortunate as it had a lot of potential, with talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
