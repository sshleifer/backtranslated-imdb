I thought it was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a well-known Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good at their roles, giving their characters some personality; but the whole thing forced and felt mechanically. <br /> <br /> The beginning could involve much more; Maybe starting with a shooting, then flashing back for an overview of how they got there or that kind of thing. And I felt that every scene routine was predictable and marked, like a very bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I really look forward to this movie and hope for something much better. The only thing I can say in favor of it is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not much.
