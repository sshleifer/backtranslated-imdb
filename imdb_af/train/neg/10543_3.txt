The only thing that The First Power really does for it is that it gives Jeff Kober the opportunity to play one of his great variety of psychotic villains, which he has done so well over the past 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger who specialized in those parts in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, The First Power is a smashed slasher movie that Lou Diamond Phillips has wasted as a LAPD detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers. Kober is his latest catch, but Kober is in the league with a lower power and they will team up and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober gave the gas room, his spirit came back in all sorts of representations. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson is on the verge of Lou's partner who has a nasty ending with a devil's horse and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights is helping Lou. Will he succeed in fighting outside forces? <br /> <br /> By the time the movie ends, you no longer care. Lou is really caught up in a turkey. Perhaps the devil made him do this movie.
