The idea behind this movie was a good one. Sorry, it is not well written. Casting Sidney Poitier as the FBI agent was a good idea and he did an excellent job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his movie, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could have been a wonderful one, and even showed some possibility, but the author really dropped us by making her role mostly a helpless woman. It was completely inconsistent with the strong independent character she was supposed to be. I don't care about Anyy's acting. The movie had to end about fifteen minutes earlier than it did. The director dried the cow before the incredible final action. I will only keep it in my collection as an example of Poitier's performances.
