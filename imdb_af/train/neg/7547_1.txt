Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, like bees, does it? This is called notable foreshadowing. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the road) Basket: Here's your doll back, little girl. You really shouldn't be so indifferent to your possessions. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Whoosh! Knuckles ?? Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! The? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! My ex-girlfriend's handwriting is really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks like the girl with the doll I was accidentally responsible for in some way killing. And she has kind of my hairline. I wonder, should I torture myself and go find her? Let's see what my friends are thinking about in the area. <br /> <br /> Basket's co-male cop: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? Ahhh. <br /> <br /> Tree trunks: It's not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Basket: Can you swing it? Grandbone, tree-named tavern tip: Huh? Basket: (save a bye). Everything is right. <br /> <br /> Sensually beautiful, previously promising actress playing a nice tavern girl: it's good. Honey is not a plant. <br /> <br /> Willow: Oh yes, and I forgot, you're the father of my child, Conan, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could have stayed and had a life with you. But I didn't. I'd rather be a princess of the beehive. I mean, never matter. (Nodes off, waking up, expanding eyes to anime proportions). Mwah, kiss-kiss. Love you! What did we talk about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Blink. Why. Is. You. Shout. By. Me? Is this because I held you Vicodin? Sniff. Snoring. What did we talk about? Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips have pain. <br /> <br /> (In the school room) Rose: What is man? Unappealling twins, in harmony: Phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Walk away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twins. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something is bad about. <br /> <br /> (At the beehives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, o bother. Dumb old bear. Snoring. <br /> <br /> (At the Queen Bee's home) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Didn't you face the Cher Cher in Moonstruck's face? (Lik's lips.) Basket: I was about to ask you the same. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How you drank. Let's talk about the meaning of my redundant "s." Basket: Watch out for that semi-truck garbage to us! Aaaaah! O. Toemaar. Damn! (Pops another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back to the tavern) Big-legged, superior tavern tip: I've tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and have taken on a small size since last year. <br /> <br /> Tree name crown: HAHAHA. All the better to throw that runner, my dear. <br /> <br /> Big-headed Hint: Completely. <br /> <br /> Basket: It was the last straw that broke the basket's back! Take it, wench! (Sluggish her.) (Edward Basket is secretly attacked from behind) Voluptuous Tavern Wench: EEEE! Get it out! Leave the island out and bring me with you! Should I approach you or what? Cut it out, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take it, wench! (Encourage kicking her face. Her eyes roll back into her head and become cartoon Xs.) Voluptuous wench: Strings ?? (At the Nicolas Cage-fried) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Basket's cell phone snaps in the middle of its bear devices and then the call is dropped. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I produced the bullets I packed from Basket's gun? He looked so surprised. You must be careful with your possessions, Nick. Hahaha. And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> All: The drunk must die! Basket: (yelling) Oh, yeah, your bitches? Well, it won't help me to help your favorite honey! Aaah. My legs! Honey, (honey, does it?) Hold that torch and get away from the basket. Honey! Smokey bear says don't play with matches. Hahaha. The ??? Watch out for the halfway truck! Ahh! O. Goddammit, these flashbacks of my drug experiment phase in the seventies become old! Where's my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fire-free. Ouch. I think something bad is going to happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my close-up. Damn! (Six months later) Voluptuous wench in the modern clothing package: I asked the random basket to take me with him. <br /> <br /> Innocent young drunk: I like people to help. <br /> <br /> Completed wench: Then get me out of my contract for the successor! I think something bad is going to happen. Eeeee!
