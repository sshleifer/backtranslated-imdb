What can I say ??? This movie was so stupid and stupid. I thought it was a psychic DRAG comedy. They must be named "Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a stupid waste of time, if you want to see (WHO !!!) Jennifer Tilly is her Freaky herself, then just rent one of the "Chucky" movie, oh, "The Bride Of Chucky." watch the Two Ugly Plastic dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly got into the UGLY female version of Chucky) with a squeaky plastic rubber sex and watch Daryl Hannah pregnant, stupid and stupid; and Jennifer Tilly honing her Husbang in a food processor reminded me of my Mother trying to do homework! OK, it's just BAD !!!
