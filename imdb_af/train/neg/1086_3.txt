Despite his impressive cast and crew tree, the gingerbread man crumbles early and often. The plot is unrealistically involved, the actors' sports bad accent and director Robert Altman's participation is a wage check. Again, he played an impressive role (such as Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) that this time the letter is unsuccessful. But that's just part of the problem. Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a high-powered Georgia attorney who, in the film's heavy-handed opening style, manages to be reluctantly seduced by a mysterious caterer waitress convincing him that she is in serious danger of an ex -man and a rewarding dad. With red flags all over the world, the modest lawyer even goes to get his children in a distressed way. The battles of the gun and fist follow along with a required car hunt and if that is not enough, there is a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous final. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with a gentle and unconvincing southern accent. In all sorts of weather he walks in a ditch dress, he is blind to the obvious to keep the story. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is every bit as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall, as old man, Boo Radely, is all excited and mad as a bed bug who serves a few thick slices of ham, but his compulsion is at least likely. The female clues (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are lean and unemotive. Even the celebrity attorneys are Vernon Jordan. They are wood with the few discarded lines they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to giving little attention to his actors, Altman's mishap and scene, dripping with Spanish moss, is dark and formless, his action scenes comic book. It lacks its horrible touch and sightings (it notifies the viewer that stars and bars are still moving in Georgia) which makes Altman so unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man Altman is at its worst, even if the wage is the same.
