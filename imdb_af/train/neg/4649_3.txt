A 1957 (yes, that's the right date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a smash comedy, right? Oh, that's just terrible. It's a one gag movie: watch people being shocked at the eyes of a small crocodile. Music is thrown in, most inappropriate and forgotten. Jeannie Carson is a vibrant dancer and skilled singer. But what did she do in this movie? Princess Thirst is also here, offering oh-so-brave shots for use in the preview. Her acting level is not bad, but she is in the movie to teach someone to learn. Well, one has to do something special during this movie. The movie is now being sold on VHS by people on e-Bay. Save yourself the cost and waste of time. A comedy without a laugh. A music without a memorable song or dance.
