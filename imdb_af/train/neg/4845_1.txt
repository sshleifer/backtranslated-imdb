There is no artistic value in this movie to earn any award. Well, it doesn't deserve an audience either. Ironically, one of the film arts awards, but frankly, the camera moves are the least confusing. Every frame, you feel you get the "full picture", it's like someone who cuts your view of the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I can't bear to watch the whole movie. The part that sucked most was when I saw the soldiers in their barracks party and cherished one of the soldiers to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.
