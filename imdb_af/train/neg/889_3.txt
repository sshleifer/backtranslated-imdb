I've never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Your Time", I love visiting this city! I am in NY several times and I love the city and its stages. I intend to be touched by this movie, to jump like an airplane and to fly straight to it, but look, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it doesn't work well. Perhaps it reflects a hallmark of the city, where it is said that thousands of people live on their own. Can't find love in New York?
