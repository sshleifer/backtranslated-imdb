It is difficult to put into words the hasty hatred I have of this movie. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was explicit, the sex scene was uncomfortable, drugs were incessant and stereotyping was out of the norm, if not Italian offensive. <br /> <br /> I don't say the acting was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. All right, it's done well. But ... almost every character in the movie I despised. Not since the Bonfire of the Vanities, I shot every character on the screen.
