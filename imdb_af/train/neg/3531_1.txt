This movie is now my partner with which all other movies are compared ... as in, "was it so stupid as a revolver?" I was also in the Toronto International Film Festival last night, where a room with more than 2,000 people walked in ominous silence after being completely obscured by 2 hours of turbulent fool. Jason Stratham would have been great if he had just a goal. Within the first 10 minutes he gave a suggestion by Andr√© 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame) who DOES NOT SENSE NOW! Then there is a shooting, and then there is Ray Liotta who is wearing an embarrassment of bikini underpants, then there are a few animations, Ray Liotta's bare batting, lots of shooting, teeth cutting, art house like pretensions and more Liotta the embarrassment that laughed at each performance was laughing. . What I'm not quite sure about was the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times. Everyone in this movie thinks they are smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's incarnation of Yogi Bear. The story lines may have gone nowhere, but the attitude was out of sight! The only way this movie might be worse is if Madonna herself was in it.
