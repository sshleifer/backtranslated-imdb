Let me start by saying that it doesn't look or feel like a movie. It just seems like another TV show on top of popular girls and boys with no real movie language on top. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is the easiest way to never make the public connect with it. This film takes us to where no movie I've seen before has been done: to a realm where the movie theater becomes a warm medium that gives the public's interpretation. Too obvious. The big movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV where we can see every feature of these women on a larger than life-style. <br /> <br /> Lately, young directors seem to be making the movie for sale. It's very scary. The industry spoils the art in movies. We need to educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language really do. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch platform for young divas and jocks.
