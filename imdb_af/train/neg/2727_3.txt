This strangeness in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION doesn't really have to be included, as she's just in the movie for less than 30 minutes. What she does, however, shines when she is on the screen. The close plot less movie is just an excuse to show some Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and it's a pity she hasn't become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the "go-getter" with aplomb. Better than it was in color. The Travis Air Force base locations with some rear projection work well. What is best about the movie is some great musical interludes. If you enjoy THANK YOU LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you will love this one.
