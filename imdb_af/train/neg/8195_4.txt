Every Christmas evening I make my children another show of It's a wonderful life. I also thoroughly enjoyed Santa. So sue me. I admit it. I like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. I also like excellent, intelligent children, but like so many things, variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without Santa's annual Chinese Ka-ching cheese in all its good, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not forget anyone Bedford Falls, but I do not believe a Christmas movie should reach iconic stature to succeed. "Fred" is a perfect OK holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and enough charm for the kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, even though most of the humor was clear and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top Santa, who helped a lot. Not a good movie, and it will be unlikely to look for someone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a little spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
