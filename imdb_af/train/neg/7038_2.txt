Oh the 1980s, a time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and an army of other action stars blowing away in a remote jungle. By that time, I couldn't believe how films like RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Made money at the box, they are a teasing action box with a bit of right wing agenda and they are very dated. TROMA`s WAR is a tongue in the cheek, takes on these kinds of movies, but you have to ask yourself, do they need spoofing in the first place? Of course not. TROMA`s WAR lacks any kind of sophistication - though it makes the point that there is no real difference between right-wing tyrants and left-wingers - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie as a return. Maybe it is?
