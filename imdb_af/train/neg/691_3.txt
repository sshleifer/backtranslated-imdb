This one probably doesn't fit into the bottom of mediocre Slasher movies, but it's definitely a damn bad movie. <br /> <br /> The holiday supply made it interesting, but after the first scenes the movie shows it's poor production values ​​and dumb plot. I mean, the sub-genre was all about an untrue maniac that cut teenage years without clear reasons, but this took it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add. <br /> <br /> The cliches are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so is the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly mediocre billboard entry that should not be hyped, even if it is a video nastie label. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this shady shadow.
