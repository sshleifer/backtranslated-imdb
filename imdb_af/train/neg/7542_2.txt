This movie is supposed to be a mysterious, serious excitement about a man looking for a missing girl. But 30 minutes in the movie it becomes a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Kage randomly kicks Karate's blonde girl or when he carries "old", the old woman bumps. The lines, characters and acting are all badly done by the bat. I have always been Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he made terrible movies this year. This is by far the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an intense storyteller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go for the original rental. However, if you intend to look at it, get ready to load on some of the lines and end tunnels rather than take them seriously; It's the only way you enjoy this movie.
