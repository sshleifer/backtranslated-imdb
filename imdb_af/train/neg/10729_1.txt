Let me start by saying that I consider myself one of the most (most!) Open-minded movie viewers. Movies are my passion and I am a great regular at my local film. .. I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice on movies when I get there and I never seem able to leave the place without discussing or exchanging ideas about what is going on in the cult movie area ... I love renting strange things, and that's exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult movie video site. He told me he thought I should see it, and since the cover said something like a movie with a Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!) Atmosphere, I rented it. <br /> <br /> The mood I have given here is not really fair, because I didn't think it was terrible, I just didn't know how to rate it differently. A paper would have been more appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's the first and only movie that got me sick in my stomach. I actually felt physically sick! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned? Still, I didn't want to turn it off, or maybe I just can't, because I was intrigued in a nasty way ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terribly, a 1 like I said. Just not my cup of tea (or vodka for that matter) ...
