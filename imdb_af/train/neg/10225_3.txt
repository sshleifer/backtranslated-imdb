Now I will be the first to admit it when I say something blasphemous or unfair. So I would like to apologize for my ranting about how much I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about sum it up too. I didn't help this movie. To be more specific, I didn't like the concept of this movie. The cinematography was good. The mood was nice. And the acting was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is greasy, inaccurate and misleading. It's also offensive. <br /> <br /> I am a quarter-Cree Indian, and for some reason I personally feel offensive by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black man. And that's not a racist comment, I swear. The idea of ​​a white, Spanish, or even native American swinging a katana on a roof, fights with everything the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, with the souls of its ancestors leading and protecting the Samurai. For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana, it's also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where did he have a Katana anyway? It must be one of the replicas that even harass the Samurai cabinets. <br /> <br /> Also, Ghost Dog had no honor. At the end of the movie he shot a guard in the back through a window and killed a man by shooting him in the face through a tap drain. Not only is it a cowardly way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent killers; A group that denies samurais exists but hates nothing less. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is a bad man. You know what a real Samurai does when he teaches his master is proven to be bad or dishonest? He kills himself to prove that he would rather die and then lower himself to the level of his doggish master. <br /> <br /> Everything about the character was a huge contradiction with the right code that all Samurai meets: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So, we have a great cinematography, good atmosphere and so acting to make a satirical plot and performance (which is unfortunately the most important aspect), making it an unsatisfactory overall filming, and an insult to everything an honorable bushi (samurai) loves. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
