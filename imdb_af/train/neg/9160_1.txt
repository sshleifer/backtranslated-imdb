This movie was bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and let me see. There are so many gaffes and goofs that it is impossible to know even the characters and the plot. How about this ... <br /> <br /> The "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's miraculous shirt during a phone call <br /> <br /> The priest palace office ... complete with a table top table. <br /> <br /> There's a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look beyond the technical flaws, you will act terribly and definitely find it. I was most fond of favoring a flamboyant gay actor to play the right-wing religious zealot. His opening scene, sitting in his impeccable apartment, ran his cat cat, was hilarious. <br /> <br /> I complain to the author / director / producer / editor / star / caterer / throwing dentist / composer (and whatever he has on this move) to actually get a movie like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it can be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking match, but don't hire it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
