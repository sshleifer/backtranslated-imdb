Very silly movie, filled with silly one liners and Jewish references. It was a serious movie, but could not be taken seriously. A well-known movie ... In the wrong place at the wrong time. A gruesome subplot, with Kim Bassinger. Many robot and regiment. I noticed that Al Pacinos' acting abilities are downhill. A troubleshooter with problems but nothing more disturbing than Pacino's horrible Atlanta accent. Damage control should fix this damage to a movie. OK my one linen is bad, but not as bad as that in this movie. This movie not only runs boring, but also rebellious. Usually a riot film is watchful for the wrong reasons. This movie is not available. I did it. The plot, if it was written a little better, with perhaps a little better acting and the elimination of the terrible subplot, and even thicker jokes, could have pulled this tension out of the coverts. What we were left with is a dull, silly movie that made sure it was drilled in our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish. An embarrassment to all the good Jewish people everywhere.
