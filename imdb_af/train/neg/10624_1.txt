In another good review, loleralacartelort7890 says: "The truth is that the Americans are using a secret aluminum anti-radiation alloy. It's not so well known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is this a secret: Well, why should they reveal it? If they were in a spacecraft with the Russians, it would be VERY stupid to reveal that they had new technology that could protect the crew from radiation, which is completely wrong. (and was) no "secret" to radiation protection in Apollo The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available, using a light "honeycomb" made of aluminum and stainless steel. Apart from the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made from a phenolic resin, thicker at the bottom looking forward during feedback.This material is actually * better * for the kind of radiation we have in space (loaded stop the particles as lead, which is better suited for stopping ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma radiation. <br /> <br /> Spatial radiation is a definite problem for * long-term * spaceflight due to the risk of large solar flares. But it was simply not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The command module gave them proper protection during their short (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen tires. They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: not more than 1.5 brake, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a car accident (Conrad). It's actually pretty good statistics for a group of men in their late 70s (Shepard will be 86).
