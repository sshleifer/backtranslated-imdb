oh god where to start ...... bad acting .... characters you just don't mind ... are they american or british ... they seem to think they are in america because where else is it big forest in the city center ... <br /> <br /> one big mistake ... they drive all night through this bush ... unless they move around and come around them in Scotland, come the morning .. when the messy one is beating the faint-hearted woman ... <br /> <br /> and they are cell phones not working .. so what do they ... divide naturally, make it easier to be counted down ... so three look for a house that can be in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to care for the unconscious woman ... so, what do they do, rather than make her comfortable cover her head, cover her up or move her away even from the flower, they just leave her on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 years away .... and they have always had a camper that they can put her in. . <br /> <br /> and on the horny angels who are supposed to have human kinds so much that they are wiped out of heaven to live among us ... so, what are they doing? start with sexual relationships with any men they experience? ......... no, they are biting large pieces of them and jerking their heads down ... I think they miss the point ... <br /> <br /> it is not beautiful sexually deprived former angels not, they are cannabalistic vampires ... and as for Tom Savini, say how beautifully beautiful they are .... Well, the Gals have good bodies but nothing special in the face. the lead was much more beautiful than those so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> rubbish film waste of Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
