I recently watched Belle Epoque and thought it might be great as it won an Oscar for best foreign language film. I was a little underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the movie. Perhaps the conflict I had was that the time the movie was filmed, the plot of a man who fell for beautiful women and eventually fell for the good girl, was done so many times. Aside from the predictability of the plot, some plays in the film really out of place with the storyline (for example, a certain event at the wedding). Sometimes the film was a bit preachy in his ideas and in relation to the Franco era in which the film was introduced and the Church. The only thing that the film went for was the cute moments, the beauty and the character of Violeta who was a strong, independent woman in times when women were not really related to the features.
