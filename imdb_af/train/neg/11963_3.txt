I love Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie as I know he has admired Alan King and they will be funny together. I thought I had seen Billy's movies, but couldn't remember this one, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and false emotion; you can smell (and go!) every scene. Billy doesn't even get very funny. He was too busy trying to cry false tears or showing his anxiety how heavy his father had lowered him. Alan King himself is pretty similar, just like the subplot to be an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy only visits his father just like a major health crisis, etc. Or that two busy doctors can only close their practices into the moon. And when the end comes, son, come on fast! Almost as if the writers realized they had painted themselves in a corner and the only way out was to do a death image. Mostly disappointing with some glamorous humor.
