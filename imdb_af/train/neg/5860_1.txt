It is difficult to say exactly the words of this movie. A completely new vocabulary has to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even recognizable as "humor" or even "entertainment" in the "Rabbit Test". So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of "hubristic" and "terrific"; Joan Rivers and the "Hollywood Squares" producer, Jay Redack, overturned their meager abilities in this 82-minute feast of misery. . Try to assemble a plane! style comedy with a moderate collection of gags. (Note, Joan: German doctors were not funny since Vaudeville). They are careless of their tombs in the Catskills - it's bad enough. But the disturbance of this film crime is the director's style of the river, which can best be described as 'ugly' and a role-play of one-and-future-bones so fond of entertaining, even the worst throws. <br /> <Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of ​​Juice is a frightened Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the movie's intrepid starring Lionel. Looking at Crystal in this photo is much like watching a blind person walking in a minefield; Eventually, the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as a cheap joke after cheap joke appeared in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate on the kind of audience that might test rabbit. Cabbage, mollusks and moderate delayed lizards are probably candidates. But for self-conscious, thinking people - I advise you to throw bleach into your eyes before recommending a "Rabbit Test".
