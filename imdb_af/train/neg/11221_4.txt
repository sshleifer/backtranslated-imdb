Lolita is a rebel and she shares a few small sex stories between science and fantasy. Well, this Surrender Cinema production is not very good: very bad acting, terrible music and a story line without any story and line. BUT, the sex scenes are pretty well done, lots of lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very good final and very hot comic show. For just Lovell's supporters.
