I like Fulci movies, I really don't work and not in a boring ironic way, but I admit that they seem hopelessly improper and have cut many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed in it. Structurally, it's like most Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, more things happen and sometimes one scene may be tangential to another. Actually, it's like Conan without sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is also hardly an actor), no budget, stupid daughter soldiers and a lot of gore. <br /> <br /> This one was a tough one to come by and I could have lived without the thumb vaseline that was spotted on the camera to make it look like Hair Metal music video.
