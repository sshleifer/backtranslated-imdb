The show had great episodes, not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up "The man who was dead.", "Through the house" and "Dig that cat, he's really gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple just married to Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find that Charles just married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old retirement home. Charles soon finds a secret from Peggy's family. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should see this episode, but don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
