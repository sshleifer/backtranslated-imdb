Doris Day never gets a bad manuscript. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unharmed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real New York City lookout in 1965, but actually adapted from a late-50s French play by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do, but rejects her own discreet image and in the second half, be comated sedated (which is amusing because of the spin day give to the situation). There are some funny lines here, but the staginess of the material is of course transferred from the play ... and instead of entertaining some entertaining incidents in the Big Apple, we're caught up in the suburbs. Doris's co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) are not suitable for her, nor the shapeless hairstyle they wear. Yet it is not terrible, it contains some big laughs, and for Day buffers it is a must see. ** of ****
