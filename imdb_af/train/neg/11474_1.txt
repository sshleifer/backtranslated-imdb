This relic of a short film begins with a teenager who is trying to get a driver's license through the process. It is quickly cut with just about every conceivable subject related to cars. <br /> <br /> Such things as dune buggy, tow rails, personal paintwork and car shows are discussed. It tries to be humorous, but the movie is sometimes dull, drawn out and even sexist. Not one of the people in the movie is actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narrative and voting. Sorry, but I can't stand it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?". It's just another piece of senseless filler to take time on their "Wonderful World Of Disney" TV show. 10/01
