I watched this movie titled "Tied Up". Overall, I enjoyed Dolph's movies, so this one tried. It wasn't worth it. I read some of the previous comments about the traps. Don't be deceived. It is at best a poor movie. The acting is non-existent. The plot, which is little there, is very predictable. The movie in places looks chopped together. This one just bumps up the place. Not even the price of a cheap night rental. As a bit of a Dolph fan, I thought to see him in action. By the end of the movie you will still be waiting. Best to avoid this movie, and spend your time watching almost anything else.
