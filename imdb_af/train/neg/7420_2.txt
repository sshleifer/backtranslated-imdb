a romance without feeling, a drama of issues without point (or drama) .... This movie is supposed to be all this and fails on every account, as if it didn't try. Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team didn't really try. The actors are able to - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One element that doesn't fail is the score by George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. What a shame it is attached to this movie. In the words and movements and music of a good movie actor, the impact is synchronized and improved. This editor plastered on music without considering dialogue and movement. The image of love is, in this respect, particularly rich: an insult to the talents of the lead actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the movie that works: location photography. Especially one moment in Grand Central Station. I have advised beforehand what is going to happen; But how it was filmed in that area was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Some commentators at this council pointed out that American assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually happened during the years of MacCarthy terror. The moment the film seems to look seriously at American society, it turns into conventional romance; before any human feelings can move, it's on a (predictable) thriller escapade. <br /> <br /> Just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it insults the issues it pretends (and fails) to take up. <br /> <br /> You are warned.
