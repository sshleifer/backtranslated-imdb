If you see this turkey in your TV guide, avoid it like the plagiarism !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> A steamy big pile of fetid dingoes kidneys don't â€œI start to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one funny scene (the memory erasers), but even that is only 0.001 on the late counter (out of 1000). Whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire life.
