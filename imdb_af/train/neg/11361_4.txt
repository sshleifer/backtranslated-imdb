It's pretty surreal that these flies can do ... uh well ... it's a cartoon, so something can happen. <br /> <br /> Initially I have to tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very poor. This cartoon is nothing more than a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the tag line. This suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I didn't see anything, at least not something special I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this movie don't look like real flies. At least they could make them black. But cyan fly seriously? With giant heads and thin torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it was written for 6 year old children. I could tell it in two sentences, it's so far simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example, "They're American files!" Oh, give me a break.
