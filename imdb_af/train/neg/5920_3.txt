Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual setting for a US war film, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual topic, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, one who is the illegitimate child of a senator's dead son, another life with seven marines (one on one battle) before being killed by her returning POW New Zealander man. <br /> <br /> Unusual to see Paul Newman, such a poor performance comes as soon as his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant 'someone loves me'. <br /> <br /> Unusual for two fine "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, leaving so little of themselves on a movie. /> <br /> Unusual I can be bothered to write a review of such a poor movie, give it a miss!
