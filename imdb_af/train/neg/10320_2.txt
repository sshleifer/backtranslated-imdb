I really hope it would be a funny show, with all the hype and the clever preview clips. And talking about hype, I even heard an interview with the shoulder's creator on BBC World Today - a show broadcast all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this spectacle doesn't even come close to delivering. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that sounds funny, the first time you hear it, but then it looks lame - and they don't get any new treatment or twist. All the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - good - mediocre (I'm nice). This is the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you're Muslim, I think you'd be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white, you'll probably be offended by the fact that almost all the white characters are portrayed as either indignant or both. Not that fun of white people is a problem, most of the better comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem if it's not funny - like this show. <br /> <br /> Canada is bursting with funny people - so much so that we regularly go to Hollywood. So how can the producers of this show not find any?
