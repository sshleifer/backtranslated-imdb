There's not a lot of entertainment in this whole movie. There is not one scary, funny or even interesting scene in this movie. It advertises itself as an abomination, then he will call himself a comedy. It doesn't even make humor. It also doesn't try to be scary. <br /> <br /> Not to get bored with this movie, you have to be one of the easiest entertainers on earth. If you want this movie, it's even a LITTLE BIT than you don't need. I have a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers are trying to achieve. It's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. So was it supposed to be a drama? Because it wasn't dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Just do yourself a favor and don't look at this movie. Life is too precious to waste 90 minutes on it.
