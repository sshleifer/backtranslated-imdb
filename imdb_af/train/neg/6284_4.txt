I like the initial premise of this movie, which led me to search it out, but the problem I found soon is that one knows very well what will happen within the first 20-30 minutes (the double will come from behind the mirror and <br /> <br /> There is no real twist, but the final disclosure also doesn't make much sense (how can she with uncertainty and fear of the whole movie, if she's a evil id from outside the mirror). <br /> <br /> The plays "outside the mirror" were cold when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively dirty, but eventually a movie seems to be be in search of a story or a more enticing script, atmosphere on atmosphere, and about the evil, sly sound design for 80-90 minutes, don't really cut it, and it really gets boring.
