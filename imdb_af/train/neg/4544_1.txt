This movie is just not worth your time. The confidence in the New Age mysticism serves as his only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been repeatedly recycled. <br /> <br /> I was just asked to spend some time commenting when I noticed that some were trying to get this reputation out. Their motivation and objectivity are questionable, as they encourage you not to look at the movie mistakes, but on the well-conscious message of the New Age consciousness. <br /> <br /> So would it be good for twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians, or Islamic Fundamentalists, to include positive ratings on movies / television that support their view? Despite the poor characteristics of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historical bases? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers will come right behind me to say floral things about this movie, despite the truth.
