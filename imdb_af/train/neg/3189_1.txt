I think it's going to prove that Joe Don Baker is going to do anything for a buck. The concept of the movie wasn't very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it. I don't know where to start. The acting is terrible. The cinematography is at its best marginal. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ends up at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote it and I can't believe 9 people actually thought this "movie" was great. They had to be the two go-go dancers. Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the safe outside Wichita and never let anyone see it! A 1 out of 10 rating is much better than it deserves.
