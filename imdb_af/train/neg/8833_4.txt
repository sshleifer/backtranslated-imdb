With no action for the actors (they all gained good performances), the overall story wasn't done very well. The movie starts with a good singer: a crazy old man forces a young Aboriginal girl's car off the road. But then we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up. They seem to be the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> While the story picks up at that time, it really doesn't go anywhere. After 2 hours I asked myself: was there a point, or was it just to see the characters struggling with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they dealt with the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. Although well behaved, there is no strong enough spine in the film to recommend it.
