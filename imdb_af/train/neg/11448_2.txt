It is not as funny as Perfect Stranger, but it was just not funny. It could not meet one kind of comedy - it jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to little guys who were big, to sleep, "Loser" (the movie's) comedies. Although there were some funny slapstick moments (the fall under the hill), no one was in any way very funny or outstanding. 'Schindler's List' was tastier (and shorter). You never knew whether Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, a college dropout or just a loser living at home with his mother, Sissy Spacek, in her worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, the serious actor, if I just had to mention one, is getting read in the camera. The story dragged and is completely predictable up to the end (no spoil here if Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it). Don't spend any money watching this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the tip and start producing quality (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are quality).
