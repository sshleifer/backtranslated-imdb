The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are completely acceptable and surprisingly visible. The characters are credible and interesting. The cloning laboratory looks really high-tech. Then it collapses. The characters start acting idiotically, and a new subplot is being launched critically from nowhere on a merger reactor (and this is presumably "contemporary"). The only plot earnings is that it is necessary to kill the dragon - just do it. The finish is incredibly poor. One wonders what has a movie that started, so turning so wrong. <br /> <br /> All the characters except Dean Cain are played by the Russians. This leads to some strange situations and details, such as the character Vessela Dimitrova played, called Bailey Kent, despite her heavy accent (and despite her inexplicably switched to * Spanish *!). <br /> <br /> Due to the decent start, I considered the rating of this movie a 5, but it was really more disappointing than that, so I only give it 4.
