It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Once again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse sounded on the back and the front page also looked nice. (After I bought it, and the movie "Malevolence" I also reviewed here, I learned my lesson. I love horror movies that take place in the forest or in the desert or on a farm. in the forest of Texas, but probably filmed in the director's backyard, the production was probably the worst I've ever seen, the actors were absolutely the WORST, and the story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to FYE and another "mum and pop" store that used to buy DVDs and neither would it. That's how terribly this poor, unfortunate excuse for a movie was. some bad movies seen (Troll 2 for example), but it definitely takes the cake, I didn't think there was a worse movie than 'Troll 2', boy I was wrong! Don't buy this movie, unless someone does it for free handed you, but even if you held it, unless you throw it out n do !!!!
