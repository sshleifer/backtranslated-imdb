This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I have ever seen. And I'm quite surprised that Pilate wants to complete Jesus in this story, when the Scriptures (as well as the other movies) are different. It also lacks a very important issue: The Resurrection. Neither of the other movies overcomes this important role: the faith of all of us. Christians are in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is in vain." A very impressive scene for me in this movie was the remnants of the palms used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and unlike my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was NOT a myth. And he was also a JWW. There are many documents (desperate and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I have said, God becomes a man) who has indeed changed man. I strongly recommend him (given he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century.
