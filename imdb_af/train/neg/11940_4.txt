Well, I will lie if I said it can easily compete with Spiderman or the Batman movies. Yet it was more appealing to me because it has moral value. I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid fans of Robert Townsend and have since been credit cards to fund his first film, "Hollywood Shuffle". In fact, he has to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisers to make the movies more credible, but his movies are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man offers a hero with an urban contemporary feel. I always felt that, if there were superheroes, they would not give the same scenarios as depicted in the cartoons. Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems: Car break-ins, bad environment, local drug-dealing gangs that use children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission remained pretty much in the community. <br /> <br /> What I seem to be really entertaining outside of James Earl Jones's "young forever" performance was how the neighborhood responded to its newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a complete agenda for him without his input. It was hilarious to hear them offering to lend him to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was poor, the movie was predictable, there was bad acting and continuity was rotten, but it stands at my 1 # 1. bring. I doubt he will ever be truly acknowledged as the talented actor / producer / director he really is, but there is and will always be, those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One point to think about The movie, which I find amusing: During the whole battle with Simon, nobody bothered to call the police ???? Also, what mother and father do you know who will watch their son fight from a window? My mom would have been there, by my side, counter-to-toe. Dad will load his gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent and watch it. It is worth seeing at least once for those of you who are supporters of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Is. Great work with the cameos Robert!
