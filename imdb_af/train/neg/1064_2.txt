is warned: this movie tells many love stories without any coherence. <br /> <br /> The only purpose of this movie is to show love in many different ways. Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a sketchy idea of ​​a plot. The author tried to build in turning points aimed at surprise the viewer. However, it just didn't work out because you didn't get the characters before, or these "jokes" were just stupid. <br /> <br /> It is a movie about love that does not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I don't know and I don't care.
