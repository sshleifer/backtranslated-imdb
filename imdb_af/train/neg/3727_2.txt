Written and acted by sincere amateurs, produced by exploitation, it is boring and difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie ever, but at least like _Plan 9 Van Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two. I commend _A Thief in the night to just run ironic and hardcore Dispensationalists. I'm not. <br /> <br /> Don't believe me?
