It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It says a lot, considering the choices I made in movie rentals. <br /> <br /> I based it on netflix based on the fact that someone I went to high school is topless in it. The topless scene has been around for about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having ping-pong sticks under my toenails as they were forced to listen to Roseanne, singing Big Spender. <br /> <br /> The "sketch" is stupid and consists of the worst kind of youthful bathroom humor and dressing room gags, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off from The Kentucky Fried Movie you will beg Big Jim Slade through the wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (whoever). <br /> <br /> If you're not a masochist, avoid this stack of garbage.
