The thing to call the "House of the Dead" is the worst movie of all time, and it really isn't. There are worse movies out there. I see a lot of the Hong Kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama that contains sequential ninjas that are put in the end to create something that can technically be called a movie. The dead, however, are one of the worst movies I've ever seen at the theaters. As I walked halfway through, I actually felt I was a bit thirsty because I was 45 minutes away from this trash can.
