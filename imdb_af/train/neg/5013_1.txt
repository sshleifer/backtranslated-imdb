I will not argue with anyone who made this movie feasible, but it is Jan Jones' performance, but please look at her if you do not start the AMC TV series Mad Men later this month. She is excellent, just like the whole cast. I would well assume that she had applied the "Taboo" role strictly for the money, and to realize what a turbulent mess it would be, has a minimal working job to prevent famine. know if this is the case, but now I am sure she can act. <br /> <br /> Initially, see "Taboo". I was convinced that her flat delivery was a cunning choice that would later lead to a significant revelation of her character or plot. Not so lucky. It is hard to believe that the director did not at least suggest that the expression for 17 consecutive scenes could change, it could be ironic. <br /> <br /> Ironically, her winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a character that, at least in her early appearance, has been greatly suppressed, reserved, uncertain, and rather colorless, unlike herself. her "taboo" roll. But when the TV series progressed, she began to blossom into someone asking her traditional early 60s girl role in the early years. Can't wait to see where they are using her character in the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid "Taboo" like leprosy, but definitely go from "Mad Men."
