This movie is terrible. Awful. One of the worst movies ever. I can't even think Gigli is worse than that. Previews told us "NO", but when we were looking for something in the midst of the drink out there, we decided to go ahead and give it. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. He is an image and can look good with explosions, but not even the kind of Bruce Willis came in "Die Hard". If he had stripped his shirt and fought around, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini flops again (if it wasn't for the Sopranos, he would be washed) as he did in "The Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck piglets every scene and like others said - no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILE FOR ALL COSTS.
