I'm so disappointed. This movie made me feel out of my time and spiritual energy. Here's the everyday Woody Allen movie in general: debating the neurotic upper class Manhattanites or cheating on their spouses. Woody, I've seen all these characters, I've seen your storyline ten times. Where did your creativity go ??? You have to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change it with it. <br /> <br /> There are many more interesting and funny scenarios that you can apply to your brand of anxiety and neuroticism - why not try When I hear that Woody Allen is coming out of a new project, it doesn't matter to me - for now I have come to expect. his old standby: the couple who get tired of each other and eventually cheat. Depression and the same guy, the same guy. If Woody wants to win back his supporters, he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence needs to be stimulated - not offended.
