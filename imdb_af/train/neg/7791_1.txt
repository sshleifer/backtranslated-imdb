I saw the original non-baptized German version and I was amazed at how bad this movie really is. Think I saw my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and something like that, nothing could have prepared me for that! It was really a pain to put through this movie because there is no plot, not good acting and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, which are nothing more than white makeup and their old clothes do not wear. their good set will not be destroyed by ketchup and marmalade stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, watch it for everyone else, don't do it, because you'll regret it!
