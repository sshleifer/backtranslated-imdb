The problem with the book, "Memoirs of a Geisha", is that it had Japanese surfaces, but under the surfaces it was an American man's way of thinking. To read the book is to watch a wonderful ballet with good music, sets and costumes still performed by sheep dressed in those costumes. So far from the Japanese ways of thinking, the characters were. <br /> <br /> The movie is not about Japan or true geisha. This is a story about some American men's wrong ideas about Japan and geisha filtered by their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it's not about Japan or Geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why does it make an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hangings, no connotations of sin over sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. As it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie, Sayuri shrunk her nose and for five seconds with disapproved fury as if the man trying to hide her dropped a handful of cockroaches on her cross. <br /> <br /> Does anyone actually have sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be debauchery, but all we see is that she is pushing her lover because she doesn't seem to be caught up to do something dirty. Such a typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy her first surprise by an old old codger after her cherry auctioned? Nope. She lay there like a cold meat cat on a cutting block. Of course, it's not supposed to enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they give her anything to enjoy? Why should all generations be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha was President Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could make the auction and win herself. Nobu did not even pray. So why did the chairman make the old codger win, and the old man stink, get his fingers over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to make sense. Being behind Mameha, the president blamed Sayuri's geisha training. In order to recover his debt, President Sayuri told Dr. Crab sale. Through Mameha, the president sold Sayuri's sexual favors to the old parent so that the chairman could make money from her. The chairman was not her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love stories. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is beautiful, but it's like the beauty of a very attractive, seductive transvestite whose voice, appearance and touch are exciting. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the wrong Japanese surface of the film, the ominous secret is that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are completely American and masculine. Not the best thing to be if it is different from a lie, distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Sophisticated, elegant simplicity. MOAG style ?? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha? Her swept up. MOON geisha ?? Loose hair that must surely be found in the thick paste of white makeup. Japanese Shaved Ice - Japanese is fairly strict about seasonal observations. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treatment. MOAG shaved ice - The president buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this treat during the cherry-flower display season. The thought stirred my whole body with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha-locks. <br /> <br /> Japanese Wind Climb - Use in the summer because of the sound, thanks to the wind, the Japanese cooler feels. MOAG bell - a doorbell! If someone was standing in front of another's house and making noises with a gorge, they would be considered insane, not access. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Emphasis on human relationships, group-oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a life that's mine." American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance? Refined elegance. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG dance ?? Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a non-very favorable white Japanese funeral skin. Run by a geisha on a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha? <br /> <br /> Home fire in Japan? Breaking out or even breaking out a fire is worse than murder because it poses such a serious threat to the community. Fires can destroy the wooden villages, cities and cities that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill so many people. MOAG fire - Great add-on for a battle scene, but there are zero changes and because it is no longer needed, the out-of-control fire miraculously expands. Technically, the movie ended here, as Sayuri would at least be wiped out and joined her sister among those who had never heard again. This is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall must be wiped out. <br /> <br /> Enough. The movie stinks.
