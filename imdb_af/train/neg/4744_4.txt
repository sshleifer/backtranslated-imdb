The worst DCOM I saw. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. It was just bad. The play and story were good, but the effects struggled! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fight was between the brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene I was excited about. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie very boring and the movie suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a four for Brenda Song which is a very funny actress and that one fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
