Wow. It's about as much as I can say now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? Which self-respecting actor would agree to act in these things? O my God! I don't know how I made it through this movie, but I assumed the fact that I had 8 cups of coffee that day was the key to keeping me awake. Good Lord! It was one of the most exquisite and predictable pieces of cinematography I have ever seen. And for the record I never plan to testify again. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw the movie when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I love her. She's cool. I'll see it as soon as I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to see it without groaning every five minutes and wondering how this bunch of jaws would come to an end, really I did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what's with the thing he thinks what's going to happen, does it catch up with real life? It was annoying enough when the father used it in 'Parenting' ten years ago. The "jokes" - and believe me, it takes a lot of me to call them - stupid, the characters are thin and forgetful, the storyline is completely predictable ... it makes a movie out of hand should be put. HISTORY RECORDS! I had to think something was wrong when I realized I had never heard of this movie. It was probably a straight-to-DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone who may think to watch it, I have one piece of advice. DO NOT! For the LOVE of God ... DO NOT !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can't get rid of it. No one, and I mean I never want to buy it from me! And I'm talking about second-hand and third-hand savings stores that will buy the mud from your shoes and bump it into the shop window. It should let you know how CRAP is.
