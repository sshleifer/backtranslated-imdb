The Thinner's plot is definitely thin. And rough. An obese lawyer drives over the Gypsy woman and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to the bone. OK, gypsy curses should be entertaining, but losing weight losing badly? Nope. Except Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another writer author and the screenwriter of this horrible movie, does it too. The lawyer is not just irresponsible, he is also fat, haha! The Thinner is like an immature piece of shit for a person who has had to see how he / she has never seen it as dirty as fat. Hey, I can only say, well, look at the mirror.
