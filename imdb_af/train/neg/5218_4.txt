All the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place: a dialogue with biological techno-babble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood acting, a terrible late-80s Casio score and an overall look on the Sci-Fi Channel's programming schedule, about 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with a lot of promise, the movie is obscured in mere idiot and MST3K styles cheese as Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is under pressure for information about his mysterious projects. But if he is testing his vague experiment on himself, he turns into a vaguely defined being (which is more than a comparative agreement with 'Dr. Freudstein' of 'House at the Cemetery'). The FX work is pretty good for such a naturally low-budget production (although I suspect most of it is kept in a shade for a reason), but generally, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro aftertaste. in your bowels, in spite of its hope to turn us around. I can't help but agree with the one remark's conclusion: "(It was) a nightmare ... of the past!"
