Let me be honest. I didn't watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized that I had almost fallen asleep, I decided that I could just as fast go ahead and see if it became more interesting later. It didn't. This movie is just a collection of lame efforts to make a story that has already uninteresting and badly told something it never would be: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is made well. This movie is not and will only put you in a deep sleep if you try to see it. Lastly, I find it important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain, so if you feel that you should look at it as a small research on the Internet, you will surely find a place where you will not have to pay to see it. stack of cinematographic missiles.
