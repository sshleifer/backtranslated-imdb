Well, they say nymphomania makes you dissatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomania, but she is probably in sexual relations with men. She is still exploring and trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, but she seems to have a good idea at the age. (However, I cannot agree with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all be so old.) For the most part, this movie has left me cold, though not the worst. you will ever see its kind. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut', at least something happens in this one.
