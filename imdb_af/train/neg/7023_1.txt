OK, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and rented it in the movie for about 30 minutes. We exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what this movie is about and, more importantly, I give out what it ends with" cans and decision. We need drugs to get us into the "plot" or just the pain stop and then see something else. We chose the latter. <br /> <br /> I like "But I'm a Cheerleader" but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Beter as sjokolade", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
