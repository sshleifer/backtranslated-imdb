SPLIT SECOND might be a good movie. A story about a "road rage" murder, has a very young Clive Owen who is performing well. BUT ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, filmmakers undermine their own movie with idiotic camera work and really awful editing. The camera jumps over creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress of business, family and traffic. What it actually does is to give the viewer a headache. Because the filmmakers have done nothing about making a good movie, but just to impress each other with their idiotic photography, they shouldn't waste time. .
