This movie is not very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror movie. The plot is just unhappy and doesn't happen much. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had a lot of chances to kill the vampire hunters, as it shows that she is lightening like reflexes. But when she has pinned one of them, she only takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder it went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL THICKNESS: Not everywhere, as good as the first Vampire movie. You are a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
