I borrowed this movie because not only because of its gay theme, but the idea of ​​role play really enchanted me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco as I live near SF. And of course it was nice to see shots of the Castro district (although the castro really makes provision for me more than gay men). But unlike me, this movie can't really recommend it. The characters were not really developed for me to care for and when they finally started playing, I was already bored. And the role that scenes I saw was a bit embarrassing to look at. The play leaves something to be desired. Needless to say I didn't finish the movie. I'll hit this one.
