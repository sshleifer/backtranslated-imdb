Avoid this one unless you want to see an expensive but poor movie. For example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This film seeks to combine the western, drug-intrigue and ancien regime costume epic. What? Well, consider it. The cowboy music is hilarious during sword fighting. Or how about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone needs to do a "What's Up Tiger Lily" on this bomb. Rewrite the script and then either dub or endorse it. Heck, that's almost now. (VAT, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to American audiences, the roles.)
