Not only does this movie have a bad plot, bad direction and terrible acting, it makes a whole new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "White" chicks are the locks, "White" boys are the wana gang gangsters, and successful (yes again). "White" businessmen are irregular toilet shooters. <br /> <br /> I just wonder what would happen if I made exactly the same movie with exactly the same storyline and script, I just made it about Caucasians. "He's nice to finally see you don't have the black chicks." <br /> <br /> No one wants to see it, but look again at this movie and you will vomit about how they are the new Zealand "white boys". Suddenly she's white people who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores out for a quick bang. Only Samoan girls have a heart, there is no such thing as a non-white white girl. <br /> <br /> It makes me think they can't make this movie without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm over-generalized, look at this movie and see what you're making of the "white boys". Just because Samoane chooses to call our "white boys" in real life doesn't mean it is funny. If I said, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be racist.
