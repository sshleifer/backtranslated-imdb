With all due respect to this George Stevens sr. "Epic" of miscasts and mis-readings, I can only wonder that the James Dean "legend" can survive this outing. Bumper of his own 'gigantose'. Also, Rock and Liz were not much better. Let's just say that television "Dallas" was the authentic "heir," even though the last "Texans" were Lay and Delay, not to mention our supposed "president" of this here's Yewentighted States of Amurrika. one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions. I never read Edna Ferber's original, but will be back. It is better than the head and shoulders here. And all the well-paid, I would say, "supportive" actors of note and celebrity, but, "Giant" is at least a little thing to me, but nothing but promotional campaigns.
