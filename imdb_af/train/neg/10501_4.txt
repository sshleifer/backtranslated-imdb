Some say Steve Irwin's larrikin antics and greedy personality are just an act. Look at this movie: it's clear he can't act. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, small-screen dangerman star in his * Crocodile Hunter Diaries *, * Croc Files * and eponymous * Crocodile Hunter * series see a nominal trend here, or is it just me? ), Rockets his bigger-than-battle persona on the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * (Yes? There's a definite trend of words starting with 'C') - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * combined with a B-movie. <br /> <br /> On a mission to move a large crocodile to save it from an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and wife Terri are unaware that the crocus by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom) is found to repair a spy satellite dish that has swallowed it. Will it hurt my credibility to say, "They're on a collision course with Wackiness"? (What credibility? - Ed note.) <br /> <br /> The plot is irrelevant as it is Steve's animal magnetism that propels the film. If you try to try his person, the movie is a failure, but if you are a fan of him (such as a businessman, a custodian or just one-day clown) or his television shows, you expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget . <br /> <br /> John Stainton, faithful leader, best friend and helmet of Crocodile Hunter * oeuvre * (can be called with a straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that Steve has made a domestic game muscle. <br /> <br /> The biggest stumbling block in this movie is that Steve (one of the few people you can actually hear the exclamation marks as he speaks) and Terri (Steve's 10-year-old husband, hardest ally and closest friend) , treat it as one of their documentary documents, break the fourth wall and talk directly to the camera while all the other characters act as if they were in a bad movie. good ??). It wouldn't be so uncomfortable if Steve and Terri were separated from the rest of the characters? but when the bad Americans are constantly threatening Steve's life, our confused viewers have to ask ourselves why the careless camera crew does not call the police at least if they do not try to observe the bad guys with the boom or run shouting in the woods ?? Anything except to be filmed with great lighting, sharp sound and seven action angles. Terri was painted unfairly as Steve's poorly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of a brave line and reads in the pearl-shaped cuddly jeans - I don't complain later), Steve goes over his business as ordinary from show-and-tell with creatures aimed at killing him, doing all his stunts himself, for him it is not really stunts, just a day at the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, look at this man's coo-cow adventures after his tragic death in September 2006, a strange riot over the proceedings. But for those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as several incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter * series in continuous re-runs) keeps him as alive as in our crocodile graves. The resentment of his absence will only be apparent to him nearest to him. And I really wish them the best to follow in his outstanding footprints? <br /> <br /> So does this distraction enjoy what it is ?? a half-baked movie with a perfect legend. He died what he loved? interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for his first feature film to portray him. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
