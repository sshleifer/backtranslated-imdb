I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's, but I'm looking at his performance in glimpses and I think the performance is a fine guilty pleasure and a great way to kill time. So of course I'm going to see this movie to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored." First, Jerry appeared in about twenty minutes of the movie's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes are spent building this pseudo-farce on trailer, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks exactly like HELLLL) is a trailer-assassin who sleeps at her stepfather (a very unusual chain smoke, drunk Michael Dudikoff who eventually escapes his action heroic). The mother finds out about the case, they get into a fight, they want to take it to the "Jerry" show (that's right, no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African American couple. They take it to the "Jerry" show. The characters clash. Blah, blah, freakin 'blah! Trash is seldom this DRILL! I wondered why Hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them checked his movie. Well, now it's quite obvious !! Whether you love or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total waste of a movie (if that's what you call it). It is so badly edited, with scenes that just don't link, and after a while the plot disappears virtually and it's just over the map! Imagine just a predictable marine opera that is transformed into a comic farce. With a day off. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. It's as risque as it gets. Don't get me wrong, the scene is pretty risque, but if you look at the overall movie that compares it to the material on Springer's program, this disastrous farce seems to be highly purified. <br /> <br /> My Score: 3 out of 10)
