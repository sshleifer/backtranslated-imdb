because this is the only way you won't think this movie is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (at least worth watching) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more of a tool to give Rock some time to film for poor rising comedy that doesn't play well on the big screen. Especially because she must be jokes from the body of an old, thick, rich, dead man, but is shown to come from Rock himself. As he insults the Blacks and Whites, chemistry is all wrong. The movie is not funny, badly shot, the acting is at best poor. Go rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live Rock video and you'll be far from the game.
