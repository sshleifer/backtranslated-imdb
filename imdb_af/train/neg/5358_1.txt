It is obvious that all the good reviews for this movie have so far been insiders who were either involved in the movie or knowing someone who knew someone and saw several tracks. Well, I don't know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's pure rubbish. The only thing that goes for it is ambition and various comosings of horror legend (not on the screen for very long). It is as if the filmmakers have made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and actors such as Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman have been filming plays during their coffee breaks. It's an ultra-inexpensive, shot-on-video wannabe X-Files with terrifying performances by non-actors role players with more mullets than it is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; This is all the explanatory dialogue that seeks to explain an unrelenting plot. Their computer FX is a joke, but there is not enough of them or enough action to make this movie enjoyable in a MST3K way. After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you find yourself for the fast-forward button ... and don't leave. Absolutely worthless.
