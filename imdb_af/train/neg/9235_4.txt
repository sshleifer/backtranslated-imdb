This woman never stops talking the whole movie. She memorized every line and delivered everything without a little natural emotion. She also has a most unpleasant lisp, and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This movie has too many Betsy Drake, and not enough, Cary Grant, who wore some of the movie completely left alone.
