I finally watched this experimental Lynch shortly after waiting so long ... and unfortunately it wasn't worth it! Even for a dying Lynch fan, I found it very boring. <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful breaks where nothing happens, long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing ends with the viewer who doesn't know or care, what it was about, what happened before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> There was a Mulholland Drive allure - the blonde girl and the dark-haired girl were many Diane and Rita-esque, and a Lost Highway moment with an allusion to a major event that happened, but cannot be spoken clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's all very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it's very forgotten and I think I'll remove it from my computer and forget that I've ever looked at it. Sorry David!
