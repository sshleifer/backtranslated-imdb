I was fascinated by how really bad this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on something here? What was with the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are a few garbage bags on a roof over the hotel? Why does the narrator mock the people he has interviewed with each other (it is so obvious that he worked out the very informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor telling us how bad this movie will be, even before it's finished. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised. I believe the creator struggles to become intellectual or try to impress the intellectual community.
