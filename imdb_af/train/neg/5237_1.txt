One of, if not the worst, movies from the 80s coming from Britain. <br /> <br /> This dull story of a middle-aged lecher who seduces two teenage scrapers who babysit him and his fiery wife has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In turn, free, puerile, unashamed and unrealistic, this film launches the depths as it fails in its efforts to be funny, challenging, intellectual, and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst aspect of this movie is the way George Strongigan, Michelle Holmes, and Siobhan Finneran's strong role is completely rooted in such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the only theater by Andrea Dunbar to make it on the screen. Complete and dirty on every level.
