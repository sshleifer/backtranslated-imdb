It was talked to by the critics when it was honestly not so good. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, with only variations in tension. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was faster than the silly movie "Swordfish." The reason why this film is more popular is because it has been released in the United States and "Chaos" has been broadcast around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and USA. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film has many tributes to classic movies such as DONDAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that doesn't mean it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> See if nothing else is on T.V, but you'll probably get bored after a while.
