The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS series was broadcast. The trailers laid a lot of emphasis on the main character who had a mutilated arm, and I hoped he was like Victor Caroon of the QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT bumping the streets of London. <br /> <br /> No good luck because the RACING GAME is just a tough vibrator with the hero of a physical disability who tries to get under investigation of corrupt horse racing. I suppose if you are a fan of Dick Francis, you can enjoy it, but in the context of the late 70's when SWEENEY was just finished and THE PROFESSIONAL still produced, something is missing about THE RACING GAME . One trailer got a car over another car on a car, if it was a trailer for THE SWEENYY, you saw Jack Regan taking a car and making a confession out of a car blowing while the PROFESSIONAL would have taken a car and blown the terrorists inside. I think it's a summary of what's wrong with this series
