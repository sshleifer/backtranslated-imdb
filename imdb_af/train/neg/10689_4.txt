Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent blaming him for the US President's assassination. I will immediately point out that this is not the type of role this talented actor has recorded, and this film shows us why. He boasts a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to expose the conspiracy around the president's death, and so on, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a movie by James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' failing to grab your attention, simply and simply; some of the action is good, the acting is not bad and the story though clicked and done before can lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - well, it doesn't! The writing of the script and the direction make it absolutely sure, it doesn't suck you into the story, or you give the slightest thought to any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
