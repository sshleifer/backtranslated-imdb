This devastating comedy drama has surprisingly star reviews on its release in 1979. I remember opening the film section of the LA Times and looking at a 2-page ad for "Chapter Two" filled with glowing labels such as: " Better than "Goodbye Girl! "and" Neil Simon does it again! "What does Neil Simon do? He takes an autobiographical situation (commemoration too soon after the death of a beloved husband) and makes it blush, unpleasant and worst of all - unfunny. plays Neil - there it is, George - a writer who cannot look back on life after losing his wife, enters the spirit of Marsha Mason (real-time Simon ... soon-to-be-old Simon Simon) trying to get George love, despite his moods and general melancholy, Mason is very attractive here and can save the day if it was not for Caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-plot about painfully thin blonde Valerie Harper , bringing the proceedings to a halt.) I held out Mason's outburst ("I'm great! I'm NUTS about me!"), but I didn't see a happy ending for these two people, and the time has come prove me right. ** of ****
