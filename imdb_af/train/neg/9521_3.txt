This movie has been playing a lot on HBO or Cinemax lately. The reason is that they assume that people are interested in comparing it to the Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks caper of the same name. The only reason to see it is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I have to say Matt was in the tooth for a little while to play a high school. If he were a woman, they would have had him the MOTHER of a high school! (Is it just me, or does his daughter look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teen highjinx played by adults.
