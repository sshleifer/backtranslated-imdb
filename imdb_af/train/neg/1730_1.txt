First, I want to point out that I know only of the show because of my younger sister who always looks at it. I find this the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable. The performance will work much better if it is filmed before a live audience. That way, the laugh will only show how unfunny the show is. However, I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast. However, it makes me sick to think that they will look at the show in the future and see how bad their first TV program was. The show links well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC providers. Why the youth should be screaming so much today is beyond me. This is all.
