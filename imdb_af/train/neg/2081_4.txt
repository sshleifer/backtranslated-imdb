This movie is shown repeatedly on the cable, so. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight Luke Wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie. The female actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I think it's "funny" that Luke's even better / dorkier / stupider friend is, but that is what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the female leads will ever ever talk to any of the people. men in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is they sigh and cry and fight and as many as 2 best described guys in Friday the 13th 4. Dead * @ $ #
