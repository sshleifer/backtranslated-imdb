It is, without a doubt, the most offensive "chick flick" I've seen in years, if not ever. The writing and characterization are so based on stereotypes that the film goes on parody. Before we walked out of the theater for an hour and five minutes, we were subjected to the following themes: a baby will solve all your problems, "performer types" are miserable messes, and musicians cannot be good mothers Unless they throw their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast & some fantastic sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if she didn't live a more general life, she would end - shake - "alone!" I can't believe this movie makes it theater release. This is the kind of farewell one expects from the "women's" cable channels, which I always always get when channel navigation. I am female and over 35, so I have to be part of this movie's target audience, but boy, miss an evening's goal.
