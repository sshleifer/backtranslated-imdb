It's easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It is not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. This movie is extremely slow and I was bored for almost every 98 minutes. While the acting is at its best, the biggest problem is the poorly written script, slowly and without any direction. Sometimes an ominous mood is only set to be broken by a useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and thrown between shots. They had to try to devour a terrible script. As a big fan of good horror movies, I'm always annoyed that something bad is being made. Save yourself 98 minutes, you'll never come back.
