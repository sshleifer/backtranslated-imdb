There really isn't much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's innocuous enough, but it's a little more than a dim movie of the 70's. The movie is not as clever or as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a repetition of the tired old casino robbery story done to death. Besides the Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery grave was designed by a 3-year-old. The plan involves three women ?? One has to scrape unnecessarily and at the glance the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to sit as a waitress, to blow her lid at the first opportunity and one to stand to stand her tail. . This is pretty much it. Intricate, huh? Except for Stella Stevens and her above-mentioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-star Stuart Whitman. When he is not Stevens paws, his involvement with the film is highlighted by one of the most idiotic rifle battles ever put on film. <br /> <br /> I wanted this movie. It does have some 70's that I always enjoy and some pretty shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie itself is too boring to rate any higher than a 4/10 ?? and this is probably exaggerated. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of a very good fuss.
