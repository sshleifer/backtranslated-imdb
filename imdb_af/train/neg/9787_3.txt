... but the trouble of this production is that it is far from a good musical. <br /> <br /> Allowed, one cannot always expect the spiritual masters such as Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; Still, the music of this piece even makes Andrew Lloyd Webber look slim. It is deadly boring and unpleasant (with one or two exceptions) and just after watching it, I couldn't remember a single meaningful melody - it's quite tragic of someone who taught the whole Hundreds of people from three listenings. <br /> <br /> This is also strange un-theatrical. It takes place at an incredibly large stage (one should be really sorry for the people in the front rows who broke their necks to see something 50 meters right or 100 meters to the left) and do nothing about it. If one person has to be on stage, it's just what you get - and the rest of the huge stage is empty. For me as an aspiring theater director it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The fact is that Cole Porter has better grasped the French culture in his works than these no-talents can ever get close to. And I'm amazed at the popularity of this legendary musical.
