Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and murder. Violent Milligan at his most homemade. Slightly better than a home movie (so many of Milligans movies), it's a journey into the depravity of the 1960s. Striking for the abundance of nudity and sex, this film is neither sexy nor abominable, and is now more than peculiar. The film suffers from its uneven role and from the cheapness of production. (No one was ever sure where the money went on his movies, as he always broke). It's a bad bad movie that's not worth seeing except as a Milligan finalist, or because it has some good people to walk around.
