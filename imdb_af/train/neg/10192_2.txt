One of the lame wedding movies you will see. Smacks too much of his time, so it was outdated before it hit the theaters. The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke, except they are not in the least funny here. Molly Ringwald, what has to be said. Give you a clue to the cowardice, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding gown, because "It just won't be me" put it in this cloth, with ties and put on a top hat, and everyone smiles well at her moxy rather than ringing her neck. It's also a saucepan, watch how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
