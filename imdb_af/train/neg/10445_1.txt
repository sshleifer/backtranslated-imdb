It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the scriptures and the biggest question is how this lower scroll came through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies from deep dramas to the more masculine oriented making everything you see, kind of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I struggled to compare anything to compare it, but I just can't think of any of these, maybe star ship troops. 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and I think about exchanging my DVD player, but by comparison, the consequences are great. The acting spectacle and the writing must be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well, people, it's not one of those who kill your soul minute by minute.
