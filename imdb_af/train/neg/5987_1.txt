I really didn't like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! - However, I looked like Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds. And the British were bad things? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope). What happened to that? Oh, and they continued with things like 'The Thunderbirds' - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why does it? I would like to see it again made in 20 years with more British cast. I chose the original series. Sorry!
