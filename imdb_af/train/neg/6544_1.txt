I paid one dollar for this DVD and initially I cut down, but then I started thinking and I have to be grateful. I found a holy grail, a real touchstone of bad theater. If you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully with Evel's awkward camera address monologue, then wait until the opening credits roll on the driver's butt. The writing appears to be merged from press clippings, and ESL textbooks. But ..... I just can't believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems totally unrelated to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can find is: "I bet they think I'm cute, very cute!". It's an epiphany! I now know how bad it can get.
