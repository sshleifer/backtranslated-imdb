From the thought of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of movie life. It is supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard. The only similarity it has made Haggard actually wrote that it is happening in Africa (though it is an Africa that has dinosaurs - who use our fearless adventurers to pull their canoes!) And have some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) tried to find treasure, armed only with a medal, and ended up exactly where the treasure is, purely by chance. Along the way they meet a mixed variety of extremely lame monsters, pick up a French chef, and McCallum has a relationship with the Queen of Fenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's a hoot. That's the only reason I didn't give it one.
