Michael Jackson would have demanded a place for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loved children. It didn't work (and why should it?), Instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by saving "Kid Midas". I would strongly recommend that all future screenwriters thoroughly study the actress's in-depth dialogue in this amazing fantasy adventure comedy that is a step closer to ISHTAR. What Murphy says or does can be the best, but don't make me wrong about his beautiful comic talent; he does not belong in this movie, and is the same for dr. Dolittle! The violence and imagery combined are reasons to stomp it as a classical classic camp, and it won't make sense, as Hollywood and movie fanatics invaded the man. In the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame, they were pulled off incredibly well. Murphy is much better off going to AMERICA and HRS, but this filmed film is not my touch of golden honey for a tasty crunchy taste.
