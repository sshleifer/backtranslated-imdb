Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decides to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! Of course I'm talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I talk exclusively about those seasons, this show would have got eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appeared after the first two seasons were not good. They were, and are terrible. The comedy is not funny at all. ANY !!! <br /> <br /> The original movie was full of talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name is). They all had to offer better after leaving MAD TV. This show is highly overrated, and worthless of your channel is surfing time like Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Get out on Saturday night and enjoy, and let MAD TV dry and die, as it deserves.
