NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNIE was a flop when released. It wasn't long in theaters in my big city. Why? Because it's VERY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way, but bad in a very painful way. The entire play of actors was mostly unknown and remained unknown to this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really big (a parody of bracts), but performance is very lacking in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond to see this embarrassment.
