A slow, boring and one-dimensional movie! Good casting with clich√©d dialogue, boring story line, and helpless direction of Mr. Marshal! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent is lacking in heart, new insights and depth. The main character looks extremely because of her small phisique and fake looking contact lenses. The lexicon used in the geese is forced and a little too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the way of education. The story goes on and tries to convince you this little, boring, flabbergasted Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha. They actually say in the movie: "She's destined to become a legend. The movie is just boring, it's great to watch, it has some interesting moments as much as you can find out for Cigarettes: Basically, if you do not believe the messenger, you will not believe the message, and this girl has not filled the shoe! Drill, boring, skip it!
