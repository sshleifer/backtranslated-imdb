This movie seems to be a training exercise for the Coppola family. It doesn't seem to be an "A" or a "B" western. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must turn into his grave. <br /> <br /> All the B western cliches are here. The two-gun pearly has witnessed hero in the white hat with the reliable pitch ("C'mon Thunder"), the all-in-black bearded villain, the heroine in distress, the farmer in trouble, the cowardly sheriff, over the above bad guys etc. <br /> <br /> The acting, with few exceptions, is strictly the Yakima Canutt School. Chris Lybbert (who?) As the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) If the villain looks like they would have been more at home in a 30's Poverty Row quickie. The addition to the film by veteran artists Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but they are not given enough to save this one. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine frame sequences? Should we believe the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a great lover of Western from all genres, I have tried hard to find some redeeming features in this movie. The cinematography was pretty good and the settings looked very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main cork, the other characters looked authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were to revive the Hopalong Cassidy character, they might have thought of portraying him as he was originally written - a Grizzled Foul-mouthed Ranch with a slide on his shoulder , the kind of part Lee Marvin would have found out. <br /> <br /> What else can I say ... Thunder, on bulk.
