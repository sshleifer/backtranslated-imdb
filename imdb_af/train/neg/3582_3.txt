No, it's not the horror movie. This is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent film of 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman who comes between them. She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the champion meets, that is. Although she marries one lap, she starts flirting completely with the champion until the climate-final box between One Round and the champion fights. She comes back to the corner of one round, just when things look their brightest and he miraculously finds the inner power to win the battle and win back his wife's love. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early in Hitch's career, but the limitations of time didn't have to make him a lasting movie. Although there are special movie sticks, and some comedy relief, this movie just doesn't hold any of its later work. However, this should have been very dangerous for the period with the shameless adulterous woman. It may have been the setback in 1927. While watching all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they can be rediscovered on today's screen and really get away. Maybe I should be the one. <br /> <br /> Save this movie unless you plan to watch all of Hitchcock's movies. You can fall asleep in the middle.
