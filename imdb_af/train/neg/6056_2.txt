To be honest, this film is another in a series of great disappointments. Most of these so-called "masters of horror" films are just awful in terms of their subparate effects and ridiculous story lines ... except Ron Perlman, everyone else in this movie cannot act to save their lives ... the shooting sounded like someone was playing Bop it under the boom or something and looked totally unrealistic ... overall this movie is as scary as Home Only ... the only good masters are Cigarette fuels, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night because they know that they actually destroyed the genre that some of them used. .
