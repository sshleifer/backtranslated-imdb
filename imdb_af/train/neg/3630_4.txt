It must be assumed that those who praised this movie ("the greatest filmed opera ever," I did not read anywhere), No matter for opera, do not care for Wagner, or do not care about, except their desire to appear is being cultivated. Whether as a representation of Wagner's swan song, or as a movie, it strikes me as an unprecedented disaster, with a guided reading of the score that corresponds to a tricky, lugubrious realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that people with ideas about what an opera (or, in particular, a play, especially one by Shakespeare), should be a "must be anywhere near" a theater or film studio is allowed, Syberberg, very fashionable but without the slightest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is about bisexual integration, so that the title character is transmitted in a kind of beatnik babe in the latter stages, although still highly singing Tenor - little or any of the actors in the movie are singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but not when the voice is heard) of Amfortas, also appearing monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat while playing the Good Friday music - in which the transcendent scenery is casually represented by a scattering of shop targets and slack crocuses laid in sick peat, a advisable what my baffle. In the theater we sometimes have to share such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can't imagine why Syberberg couldn't break into Parsifal and Gurnemanz, the mountain pasture is as green as Julie Andrews provides in Sound of Music. . <br /> <br /> The sound is hard to tolerate, especially the high voices and the trumpets, with a hearing shield that brings another kind of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conduct and paralysis of the ritual. Someone in another review called the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, though often slow, has what Jordan lacks, a sense of pulse, a sense of ebb and flow of music - and After half a century, the orchestral sound in the set, in modern printing, is even better than this film.
