Spoilers? Maybe some details but nothing to plot related. Not as it would be with this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage retrieves the mid-air infiltration appearance of the Executive Decision. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commandos wearing portable black shirts, which we can only imagine, should hide invisible body weapons as their idiotic tactics (similar to what 3rd-graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground). they absorb a hail from gun fire. <br /> <br /> What entertained me most about this movie was the use of watch-like actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once watched a movie, which you really liked, although it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to post it (it was Porky's). Here Cyril plays a decent beating of a Bill Paxton character. Most Hilarious is Porker Gil Gerard, who is so fat you will never recognize him as TV's Buck Rogers. Instead of passing his generous heroic character, Gerard gives us a tolerable display of the crunchy fat, hard man, who is clearly suggested to John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a good hybrid appearance performance as a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T's acting remarks have deteriorated significantly. It's not as much as revolutionizing lines that he might have actually memorized. <br /> <br /> One of the items in this movie is a classified information CD. It is handheld and apparently and incredibly unencrypted, despite the security-wise aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke. I'm seriously doubted that the information on the CD will ever be collected in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a silencing closed airplane, the firearm is as hard as canned air, causing a person to get a good deal, so apparently no fee budget no. The variety of selected weapons is pretty funny. The flight attendant's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. Taking it intuitively to the Mini-Uzi gun, which must be one of the worst gun designs ever, it's just too stupid. A true elite team will carry MP-5s for this kind of thing or maybe SOCOMM .45's, or even adapt Hi- Powers if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 as new school ... The lame-o standard Issue 92Fs is incredibly amazing because they lost most of them cool to Lethal Weapon 1. The bad guys, supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types, have a variety of absurdity, such as the aforementioned mini-Uzi pistol and a Tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was a touch of realism I wanted to fix the other reviewers. The pilot and Ice-T dropped the vessel up to 10,000 feet for breathable air before opening the door. And I also got the impression that the pilot couldn't get the door shut, that she was basically just standing at that point. Regarding the landing, there was no flaps up to about 2 seconds before touching. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Dukes of Hazard escaping Roscoe P. Coltrane at the "pass" can scan this movie for the use of stock images. Of course, they chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they couldn't get stock of an F-117. Apart from the fact that they were already motivated in 2001, we also for a moment forget that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B-2 I am not an expert, but I have some uncertainty as to whether it would be invisible. <br /> <br /> As others pointed out, the repeated references to "F-15s" were when they showed F-16s. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put so few passengers on a 747, not to mention all the other idiots about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch it on stars or something. Don't pay to rent it, but watch it for laughter. Contrary to the worst movie ever, with No Holds Barred, at least some of its originality.
