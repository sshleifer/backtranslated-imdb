Men, I love police movies filled with action, shooting, chasing etc. <br /> <br /> Boy, I dropped off after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen it before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding ... Another two bad guys who shoot several officers and innocent people who simply stay in the fire - without touching a lot of Kevlar. </ br /> <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Go back into the couch, where the stupid hostages didn't close the safe or doors when the bad guys went out. How silly the director thought we would be. <br /> <br /> Well, the shots between what a documentary was, was good, but after I saw the movie, I just thought: why didn't the police have a decent shooting course? And why there were so many policemen and was SWAT on a really long break. Very bad.
