I have no idea what the shield producers are trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: the shield is virtually incompatible. <br /> <br /> The performances on The Shield are probably good ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so well-crafted that you can't even see the performances. For example, editing cuts away from reaction shots before they have had their full impact. <br /> <br /> I don't know what intellectual rationale is for, but it robs the performance of all emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I give The Shield one point for ambition in its subject, but that's pretty much everything I can give. <br /> <br /> It's a pity to see some talented people. exporter waste their gift on something so strange badly filmed.
