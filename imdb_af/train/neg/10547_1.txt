I don't remember a movie where I cared less about where the characters came from, what happened to them or where they were going. I realize that Hollywood's biggest pastime is nail-watch, but these people are either too despicable or boring to take time with. For what it is worth, the discussion following the show, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, applied that possibly the three women show some redeeming features. I do not agree.
