I read Chris_m_grant's comments from United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A great documentary of 1924. This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and people interested in Bakhtiari Nomads from Iran, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes and watched the movie Grass, A Nation's struggle for life. These traditions you've seen in the movie have endured for centuries and will last as long as life endures. I am myself from this region of Iran. I'm a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is not in Iraq in Iran as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and separate countries. Taking an Iranian for an Iranians is almost like taking an American for a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
