Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail boy for struggling TV station UBC (that is United Broadcasting Corporation); He's not going to work, and offers ridiculous projects like "Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog" to studio performers - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) declined wisely Russell's suggestions, but have no idea how to choose a hit program. His secretary Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who has dual duty as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee that provokes the Russian clash when he wants to watch TV. It turns out the monkey looks at all the popular apps and can easily select the hits. Russell discovers the chimpanzee's talent and uses him to advance his own career. Understandable, things get HAIRY for Russell and the throw! <br /> <br /> Raffles the chimpanzee (handled by Frank Lamping) performs well; Raffles looks bored and / or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimpanzee is interested in being interested; it could be fixed with repeating or editing. A soft satirical edge is present - think of a monkey sticky TV show! AND, it's a monkey who gets a BEER during advertising (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal s lot of fun TV actors admitting and trying to post. You can make a drinking match in honor of Raffles beer beer by guessing players and where you have seen them before. Here's a Start - Hey, isn't it the "Dr Bellows" of "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
