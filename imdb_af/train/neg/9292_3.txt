First, I also expect another hero - a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I only saw parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine it's better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> Basic elements of Hero come in HoFD: Great landscapes, hypnotizing cinematography and sincere acting I mean, if you can't understand a word, they say without the captions, but you still give always about. This is good acting. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue, runs into a love story. Worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle. You have three characters that, in my opinion, fall in love with each other - for no good reason. This movie basically falls apart after escaping from prison (I slept for about forty minutes). It's almost as if their writers had changed at that time. The rest of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind." Ick. Also, you need to straighten your suspension of unbelief to understand the actions. It's not unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can't wait for the action, and then, if the fighting breaks out, it really wasn't that good. The start grabs you, but then this movie just goes out of gas.
