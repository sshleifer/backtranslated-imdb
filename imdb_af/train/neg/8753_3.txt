This movie kind of reminds me of a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie-only worse. Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think though Alysons was more the actress, in this movie Amanda Michalka was okay sometimes, but Alyson's scene. I think they had to come to high school better and that was definitely not the case. The story line was not so good and I think they had to get two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan, and this movie didn't make me that better. I think they should definitely be sick to sing and just watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (unfortunately I didn't)
