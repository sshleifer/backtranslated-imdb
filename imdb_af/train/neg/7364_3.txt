In 1692, Salem, a cunning child's lie about a slave's involvement in witchcraft, upset a whole community. Costume drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not stuffy, but it is also not a spectacular portrayal of infectious hysteria. Performed by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the story elements are quite interesting (especially from Hollywood in 1937), but for anyone who has since read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible", Melodrama featured here , will not be long tolerated. Biggest problem with the picture can be decisive: Colbert and MacMurray are an unfortunate few lovers who are prevented by the witch hunt. MacMurray is too contemporary a presence for this environment. * 1/2 of ****
