When I first saw, I thought it should have come from the children's section. It's fun and sometimes humorous and is actually a good story, but it has the "romantic chemistry" that actors such as Meg Ryan and Tim lack. Robbins can deliver. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein, and his performance is exceptional, but that is the only exception. This movie seems a little forced, directing dust, and oh yes ... the music is ridiculously horrible, it didn't put me in a very good mood. But if you don't expect a clever, well-made comedy / romance story, then it can be entertaining, as I said. It should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very contradictory movie, but as long as it's not taken seriously, it can be a good movie.
