1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing about the extreme stranger about 3/4 the way to the movie and you wonder if this movie might follow a cult for King fans. This is the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers (a form-changing cat food, eating meat, necessities of life, near-extinct race of humanoids) moving from town to town, looking for virgins to educate themselves to keep themselves alive. They come across as a pretty normal top-class people, except that they are secret lovers and hang cats day and night outside their home. Cats are deadly to them, so they put sheets in their garden to try to keep the population. We see that they break some of their necks when they attack (which is also a first in my movie experience) --- hopefully there are no real cats in the making of the movie. The boy is after a lovely girl he has a "sleepwalker", and then he just wants her body. There is so much champion uniqueness to this movie that it could have been better if it was an everyday satirical comedy on the suburban life, but the director tries to scare you every few minutes until you wish he will just come over and bring the gore out. Eventually it happens and the movie blows on it. It's typically Stephen King, who ends up clumsy. The film is interesting because King's humor comes more than usual, but his strangeness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably have and should have in their collection, but as a valuable movie experience it really doesn't cut it.
