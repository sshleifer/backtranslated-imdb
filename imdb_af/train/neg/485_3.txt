When I saw the preview, I thought it would be a good movie. And indeed, it could have been. The main character actress was very credible, and the beauty of the filming is unmistakable. But the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. The language level was too familiar and too contemporary for an action that took place in 1610, and it took away most of the film's magic. However, I must congratulate the translator because the English subtitles were more refined and appropriate than the original French clues, and this probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd!
