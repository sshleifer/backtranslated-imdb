The basic plot in this movie is not bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be worshiped. But, despite the good acting work of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. I blame this on Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just terrible. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful personalization of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares into space and has a "wave I am SOOOO" amazed. After just a few minutes it really made me annoyed. Now it's definitely not the only Crawford movie. I don't like her performance, because she did more than her share of overheating - in movies like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later movies, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - there was definitely better.
