True, the environment in Paris is wonderful. The actors are good. The story is a twisted morality game. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone bad enough, is it right to hurt everyone else along the way? In a true romance, you'd like to have less cliches than the man who got bored with his wife and willing to dump his family and the woman who is right to encourage him to do so. So what if they look decent and if Karen Allen protrudes her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and rejectable. Perhaps the story's morale is "you get what you deserve". I give it a 4, just for the quick scanning potential by the "male interest" bits.
