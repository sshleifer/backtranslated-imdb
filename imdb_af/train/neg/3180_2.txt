What a boring movie! To sum it all up, it was just Nana Patekar who defeated his daughter-in-law, Karisma Kapoor, trying to flee with her son from town. Can somebody say BORING ??? The concept was not bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian sites, and some of the village scenes are nicely shot. Overall, however, cinematography came short. The story could have been good, but the movie just seems to be dragging. There is just so much stupidity that one can take, let alone three bloody hours of it. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was the song "Ishq Kamina" and it was just five minutes long. Other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.
