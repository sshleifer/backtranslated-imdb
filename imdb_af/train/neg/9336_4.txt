Weaked blaxploitation crime drama aimed squarely on the black urban market of the early 1970s. Pam Grier stars in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes one-woman vigilants to drug-dealing thugs, make Coffy's little sister a junkie. Violent nonsense plucks along doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only Grier's flickering mood gives the story a boost (she is not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primary way). Not much other than what Charles Bronson did at this stage, the film was marketed and advertised as a cake exploitation, but still managed to find substantial residents in the city center. However, today it is just a footnote in the 70-year film history, and lacks the wide variety of other films in this genre. * 1/2 of ****
