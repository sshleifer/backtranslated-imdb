First, I really enjoyed Lucas Fulci from Zombi 2. This movie was completely trash. I couldn't stand to see it. The storyline was a joke, the acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more joke. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINNING PEOPLE BACK TO LIFE. However, this movie is not worth the $ 1.00. I enjoyed lucio fulci movies, but this one was terrible. If Zombi 3 is an indication of how 4 and 5 are going to be, I think I'll just oversee them. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is a fantastic movie tho.
