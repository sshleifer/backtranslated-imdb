I expected a bad movie and had a bad movie. But I couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I don't even want to try to explain what Blood-burning is. It's not about surfing blood, but a great $ crocodile. They complained about the false shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark to the end. Here, the crocodile is shown many times, and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they're not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile look at Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surf film, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? Not really, it has a little nudity, and a sex scene taken straight from a playboy movie. The acting isn't half bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Bad she didn't take her up. The main actors are also not bad. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started out with some nice surfing sounds. The blame is on the undisputed writer and director. The dialogue is the worst I've ever seen, and the writing was really badly written, and the director didn't have any talent, nor much of a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Don't look this. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Look at Siren to watch Kate naked, and watch Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked and Kate looks good (but is bad actress) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi have a good work done with the piece they had to work.
