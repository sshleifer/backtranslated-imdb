I can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It's hardly vigilant and incredibly boring, probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In a no-budget way, it reminded me of Star Wars episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are looking at a total creative train wreck. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. This is one of the "festival films" that are just the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so bad that people think it makes it "different", so good. <br /> <br /> Bad movies are no different ‚Äù, it's just bad movie-making.
