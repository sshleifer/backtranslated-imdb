It was a disappointing movie. Mostly with the material --- army is always good for a laugh --- and the stars, this movie had to be a cartoon. It was worth a few chuckles, at best. Steve Martin was much louder than that and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should remain in dramatic roles, where he can follow Robin Williams's head and ever win an Oscar.
