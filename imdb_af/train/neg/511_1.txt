I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to do the right job safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. As it was, it was again. Thanks, my scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit down the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set, but hey, the payment was good. Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who will know. The funny thing was to see the cars in the track at the very slow speed and then accelerate into the movie to those close to normal speed. Many of the screens were changed as they were filmed. I'm supposed to cut costs and time. But everyone had such a good time caring!
