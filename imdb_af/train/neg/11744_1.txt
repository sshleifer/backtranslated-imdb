After finally seeing this movie as a whole, I was completely amazed at the worship it received by critics and online users. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I won't say it. But "the last great American Western", a phrase I have applied more than once to it? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A movie that tries to tell such a story has credible characters who speak credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this movie is one of the most hacked and clich√© I have ever seen. The movie can be measured in groans per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no man would say in real life? There are so many cases of this being distracting. Cheese-like lines come to you in waves; predictable, inexplicable, and often. <br /> <br /> If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, how about bad gunfights? Few Westerners can show you a firearm that is incredible, while you are urgently trying to make the action serious. It's okay if there is a comic strip for such armed struggle, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone, the filmed and very tight choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie out of the good western list. The final act loses the director at this point, but then I was so uninteresting in the movie that it was out of saving. <br /> <br /> Unlike the mistakes, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's good shot and the settings look good. The acting is negotiable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. But if you are looking for the last big American Western, do yourself a favor - rather, rent unforgiving. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
