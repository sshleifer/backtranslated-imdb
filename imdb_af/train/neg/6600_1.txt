Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can see and feel this movie, you are a better person than me! This movie, while a beautiful effort to "mimic" Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls short of honoring them, or even a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L + H movies and planted unrealistically. The plot is astounded by the useless characterization of the other unnecessary co-stars. Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, he also tried hard to get the wonderful mix that Mr. Hardy was to create. Where was a (good) musical number? The editing is messy, the acting is stiff, the lines are cruel, physics -explainable- (though maybe they are trying to give the feeling of cheap sets?) And overall, it's a terrible thing to witness. It is even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made their last movie in the 1950s writings and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as many of the original Laurel and Hardy movies as you can, and learn how things were. You know what a MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not always answer semi-moronic quips. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for anyone who thinks it was a decent update / honor for the boys. Where was the classic theme song?!? Why ruin 'Here's another good mess'? Why is it brighter? Why was there a useless bunch of co-stars? WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OR OZ ???? WHY IS LARRY HARMON IN THIS? WHY BOZO! And did the CHANNEL help to fund the thing? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fresh jokes, for the sake of God. <br /> <br /> SPEED JOKES.
