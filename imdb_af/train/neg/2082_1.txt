What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it might be funny. WRONG! This movie is about 90 minutes long. The actors are trapped in a poorly written writing and cannot come out. The jokes are weak and tired and can't even see Wilson's naked backs. The special effects ..... are not. I expected half to see the armor and wires that Uma holds in her flying scenes. And when the effects could not master the superhero's faster-than-a-speed bullet or airplanes, they covered everything with a swirling vortex of faded screen - which hid the terrible effects. Wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office co-worker. The sex scenes were not sexy and the funny scenes were not funny. I think I expected too many of these actors. None of the characters was really sympathetic, so I didn't care about flying figs for any of them. The only memorable performances were the children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had chemistry. Overall, a super stink movie - I wouldn't even recommend it as a rental - it will still be a waste of money!
