"Flight of Fury" is a shockingly disturbed but worst of all boring Action Film - I don't expect much from a Seagal movie. All I expect is to have a sensible action for 90 minutes. Unfortunately, it does not work The action screens are small and far apart, the plot (which is completely irrelevant in these movies) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with large plot holes throughout. The acting is really uncomfortable - embarrassing Seagal and his whispered one-expression performance is best under the pity of the 3rd riders. I find it hard to believe that anything close to $ 12 million was spent on this tremendous debris, unless $ 11M was out of that 12 Seagal's Salary. The one moment of any interest in Straight guys or gay girls is that nothing gets out of sight, are two hot chicks in a lesbian sex scene of all kinds displayed on the screen. These are mediocre things that are not very different from many of the Michael Dudikoff B movies I endured <br /> 1/10
