Economist that dr. Seuss's fable emphasizes the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch's curse comes from an early childhood at Christmas and that the Whos themselves are caught in the materialism of the season, except for Cindy Lou Who (very well played by Taylor Momsen). This film makes an inventive, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss's story, but the end result is a movie that never packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones' animated version. Jim Carrey is remarkable in his actions as the devilish Grinch, but whether it is the dialogue, the pacing or the strange stories, has grown on the initial plot, but the transformation of bitter misery into a lasting benefactor is not convincingly lit. There are some wonderful visual arts and the makeup work is great, but beyond the technical triumphs, there is an element or two that is missing. <br /> <br /> Success? <br /> <br /> Soul? <Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones initially missed the initial adaptation of his 25-minute cartoon Howard in a three-hour movie. Howard, Carey and crew are all highly skilled and talented, but what a winning combination looks like is just poor and plummet in its final product. If you want to see the version of the feature length, rent it on video with Jones's animated version and you can see the bigger and glittering isn't always better. I give this movie three cans of Who-Hash out of five.
