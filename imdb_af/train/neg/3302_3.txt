Swedish action movies have evolved over the past few years into something that mimics American hardened action movies such as "Heat", but with a low budget. This movie follows the same prescription as "Noll Tolerances" and "Lifeguards". However, it is clear that they are trying too hard to make a cool and difficult movie. <br /> <br /> The story was seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor, especially from the main actress. The film tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military robbers, without any remorse and a female investigator who has completely lost it with past problems, but at the same time acts completely rationally. It doesn't work very well. <br /> <br /> The blue-cast photo style doesn't look fresh anymore, and it's not even well done in this photo. Only a few screens actually look good. The sound is also quite strange and it seems that much of the actual dialogue is recorded afterwards. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, but does not make a convincing portrait of a SWAT team. leader, has some very funny lines. Also, the music is pretty good.
