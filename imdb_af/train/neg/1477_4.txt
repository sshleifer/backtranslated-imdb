I saw Dolemite and Disco Godfather, two other good works of the blowing guns of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2), always holds a special place in my heart. For mere goofiness, lack of skill in film production, and absolute enthusiasm (honestly a bit too much), the Human Tornado cannot be locked. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old pal Dolemite is dressing up with a white woman when some racist local police attacked the house for no good reason and didn't know it! The woman in bed with ol Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. Her cry when she saw him: "He made me do it!" Dolemite's cry: "& $ * @ $ are you really ???" Subtle was never his strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The comedy of a very young Ernie Hudson (of Ghostbusters boasting), the continuity errors (characters aside in one shot, and the other in the next, Dolemite's pack-changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act) and Queen Bee's demonic eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore herself. Did the man really think he was cool in this movie? I definitely don't know why, but you must admire the sheer enthusiasm he has. Whether it's leaping completely out of a cliff, or barking orders to his gang in rhyme (eg: Quick! In the cave! I have a plan to drop the mother! * * (% & Dig his own grave! ) The man surely he will go overboard, never more than any time he does Kung Fu.The climate battle is filmed with high speed, but slows down occassionaly, so Rudy puts his teeth and grills. as they have played the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was so fast anyway, "The Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, much like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent movie of enormous dimensions, but at least it is fun, and certainly you have to give these people the hassle, just not so much, enjoy with my cordial recommendations.
