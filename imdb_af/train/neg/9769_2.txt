I read the Thornton Wilder game last year in the eighth grade. I was also forced to put on the screen through this poor translation. Let me tell you, this is not a great game, it is easily surpassed, but man deserves a much better shot. The play was really lacking, the scenery-honest to God - looked like it was designed from cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality was uncomfortable. There is this ingenious 'buzz' when an actor speaks ... and I can't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is non-existent. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which will be fine, but it will make it even more cheesiness. Anyway, I think if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which I don't really recommend, don't set your hope too high. The play, like solid, is probably better.
