I looked at this hope to find out what I didn't know about modern history's most notorious man and couldn't help thinking that history was rewritten in HITLER: THE EVIL OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessive with his cousin that he threatened to have one of her admirers' lap. Hitler arrived with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking but did the writers Adolph Hitler confuse with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? It's bad enough, but what really insulted me was that there are a lot of bits of historical context missing from this mini-series. Germany lost the first world war and the Allied forces that made Germany pay a heavy price to do so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - someone - to restore their pride and that is why they changed to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s that allied forces appear to be completely missing, so there is no way HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document and I have not even mentioned that Himmler and Goering is not conspicuous. by their absence <br /> <br /> There is one positive point about the mini series and that is Robert Carlyle in the title role. Well, some of his ways are wrong and his voice is too loud. (Archive records show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he can communicate Hitler's own character on the screen. Commenting in the British press that Carlyle looks like Sparks' sense player more than Adolph Hitler is unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I love the show by Robert Carlyle, but I hated everything about this mini-series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place. There is nothing to recommend it to serious history supporters
