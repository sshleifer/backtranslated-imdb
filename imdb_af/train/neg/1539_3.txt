I'm a big fan of the Western, but this one .... what's a stinker! I think what just turned me off from the bat was the inward dialogue. I think I could have written better dialogue than that when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Given this terrible dialogue, none of them looked and nothing but ridiculous. Really, I'm not joking. Some of this is a little better than what you would get in an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the "big" star in this movie. If you call it a B-Western, you will have praise for it. This is what might be called a B-minus Western. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents at other times. For him to appear in a vehicle, this arm must be something he tries to play for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One annoying thing about this movie is that all the men look like they haven't shaved a week and their faces are all greasy. I know in the old West, guys weren't always well cared for, but for a man it's a movie that just makes you want to go "EWWWW!" Really, it's a crummy Western. Denver Pyle also had to survive this one, especially after appearances in so much Western. Bad, bad movie.
