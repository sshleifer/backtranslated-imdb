The movie starts slowly when we get to the theater, we thought it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we were all bored from our thoughts and wondering what kind of movie we came to see, I didn't like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone. The best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home. It must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen bored to us all, and most people in the theater were actually out of doors at the end, as it was so dirty. I am surprised no one has walked earlier than this. If you're going to look, make sure you're doing something to keep you busy, better still. Don't see it at all.
