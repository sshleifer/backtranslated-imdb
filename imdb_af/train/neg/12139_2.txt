I remember when it came out, many children were about it. I think I was a bit too old to get excited and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and always found it a bit cheesy. <br /> <br /> In the early 90's, we were overwhelmed with programs like this making kids feel like they could be fighting and a powerhouse or equivalent to these kids on 3 Ninjas. Eventually, I think parents and filmmakers have got sick of it all because everything we actually had was a bit of the kids who were beating and beating everyone. <br /> <br /> Many children's movies have some great points to try. and it is nice to watch your children and get the message, this one has no message at all ... it uses only a million different things in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie has no great visual features, but will you expect it? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here. The short, thick, thought-out, old winds like a powerful ninja that was just hilaries. The kids acted too much and the latest Ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie has a plot that someone knows before reading the review. 3 Ninjas ... yes, you know they're going to fight a lot of bad guys and of course win. Must I say more. Sorry if I spoil it for anyone. <br /> <br /> With all that said, KIDS will love it. This movie is aimed at children and only children can enjoy it. If you don't mind seeing your kids movies about fighting children, it's a good movie to show them. If you don't mind allowing your kids to see complete rubbish that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or reality, then you've found a movie for your kids ... I say kids because I even think the girls will like it ... I remember all the girls have a loved one on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars, because I think you can make a movie for kids and make it even more fun for adults. This movie fails big time at that. It's cheesy and nothing original or unique and I won't let a child see me. Kung Fu's TV series is on DVD and there are tons of great Shaw Brothers movies out there. Why don't you show your kids what they really want to entertain and don't make them dumb along the way, maybe they even learn to move and not just how to kick a man like a grandfather on 3 Ninjas? No no no ... never kick a man between the legs ... never ... it's that way.
