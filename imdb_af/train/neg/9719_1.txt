Ummm, please forgive me but was not missing more than half of the characters? In the original novel, Valjean is a man who has been imprisoned for 19 years to steal a bread and then try to escape several times. He breaks the parole and is ruthlessly persecuted by police inspector, Javert. Along the way there are many characters that were not in this version. Worth is Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the movie and tried to see how it was in any way related to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
