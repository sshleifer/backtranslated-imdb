There was no single reasoning factor in this movie. The girl and I love action movies. Especially road screens (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were great), but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talk and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has fought and is therefore forced to run seriously at all times. The army disrupted its gut movements, in addition to its fighting technique. The music is also not good. They fight the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, because these guys are stupid. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise for low-budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B-style. The actors deliver their lines as if they were read from the cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and burned in a rotten Hollywood street. The film is called "Honor," but there was no honor to make this film. It was just a waste of money, and it is wise to spend. I consider it honorable. <br /> <br /> See Felon earlier. The battle scenes and situations are more real.
