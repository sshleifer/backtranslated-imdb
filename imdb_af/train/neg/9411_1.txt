Interestingly, anyone who (so far) looked like this movie had no expectations - I think it's the trick. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close the faces the camera was always, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director - it is always a clear sign of them, they think it is artificial or effective or intense about the camera holding about two inches away from the actors. However, the actors in this film only had one facial expression. <br /> <br /> If the near camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the movie killed it. The film looks completely filmed in the dark. So now we know that the filmmaker was also a rank amateur. "Ooh ooh, we're going to light the set with a flashlight! It'll all look intimate!" No, this made everything look invisible. <br /> <br /> Beyond the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the worst hint of an idea that had never been developed and nothing new about this kind of relationship was relieved. (Perhaps it's a new kind of movie for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie has won some film festival awards does not indicate the quality of the movie. film, but reflect the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this film will not win anything in the festival I saw it. In fact, twice in the movie it seemed to be over and people started to rise (this was one of the side effects of the filmmaker's "total darkness" technique). But when the film appeared, there were mules from the audience. And once the movie was finished, it was clear that it didn't matter if it ended on one of the two previous points. An earlier end would have saved the audience from even more monotonous scenes of household (fold sheets, cut vegetables, spread honey on bread). Yes, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring - but we've already found that one. <br /> <br /> I recommend that audiences miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated moviegoers.
