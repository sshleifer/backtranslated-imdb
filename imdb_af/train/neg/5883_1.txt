This movie has no humor for anyone living with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes have reminded me graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man's version of "Mama Dearest." It shows graphically and accurately the life that many children of a mentally ill parent go through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to be corrupted and acting as if it were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It's at its best sick humor. <br /> <br /> The movie is so intense and depressed that my son and I have to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe what our families actually do.
