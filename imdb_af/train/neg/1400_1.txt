Oh, my gosh ... I thought CBS primetime television shows were <br /> <br /> worst things Gerald McRaney appeared in ... <br /> <br /> Four people are being experimented by a madman mind control <br /> <br /> computer. That's it, don't rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw it under one of its many titles - "Gray Matter" - which is perhaps one of the worst movies of recent memory. The other <br /> <br /> reviews are right, it's terrible. Never settle so much <br /> <br /> Shots have appeared on the screen, never. The role is terrible, the direction <br /> <br /> is terrible, and the writing is awful. I can't stress how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as if you were having cups. <br /> <br /> It's rated (PG) for physical violence, gun violence, lights <br /> <br /> Gore, and some adult situations
