I was subject to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As figured out, it was nothing fascinating and nothing new. Although trying to be original by focusing on the teenage father rather than the mother, showing the problems the father would face. It had an interesting side to it, but it didn't just remain its originality, since nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character that the older sister likes in every other movie like this, something against him, we have the house at home, expecting too much and when he gives more, she feels offensive and leaves him in the dust, then we have the father who is always gone. Then the girls have us parents who want everything and expect them to be perfect on everything she does. On the story I said it was interesting, but the lack of stuff about the whole cast and the lack of good writing or storytelling. Everything about this happened in clich√©, the little nerd child in school started studying girl, they came together, had sex and then we had a little kid. Perhaps it would have been better if the writing had improved and the acting improved. I got more serious emotion from Leatherface and his chain saw than I did in any actor movie and it's pretty bad to see if the Leatherface movies are crazy and horridies acted. So far, the only interesting teenage pregnancy movie I've seen, Juno. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has become more visible while still giving the same message. As I said the idea was original, most of these films focus on the teenage mother, but this one chose not to post, but focused on the father's drama, but the originality did not save this movie from mediocrity again. . I really hope somebody decides to make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just another similar movie because this one has been wasted.
