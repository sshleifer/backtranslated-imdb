This movie stinks! You will want the two plus hours needed to get back. Sliding doors, w / Reverent Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, tried Melinda and Melinda to do much better. The movie was clever, spiritual and well done. I care about what happened to both Gwyenths - or rather the characters she played - and the performances by supporting role-playing were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are running, the dialogue was confronted and I could have cared less for any of these people - at least from all Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10am - and so melodramatic she's laughing and not in the comic sense. The 2nd Melinda is good but forgetful. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous ensemble movies worked, because I think he played time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this script in two months: you can tell it. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not enough to be a whole presence. The movie ends Chloe Sevigny and a lot of other people you know you have seen in other movies, but can't remember what. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
