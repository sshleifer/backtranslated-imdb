One of those thanks-I-not-live-there documentaries. This one tells of two warring factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, and the surrounding peoples of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Rifles, drugs and death run. The guys, not older than 22, who do not fight in the middle of a war are in jail. The girls ?? not women, girls ?? Always respond the same when one of them is killed, with tears and screams. You scratch your head; What did they really expect? I do not know what is more disturbing: the nocturnal shooting and civil unrest, or that everyone just accepts passive things as they are. Or, seeing the boy drinking, it's obviously not his first beer, because that's all, 10? If you were to take this one of these young men out of their situation and place them in a place where they had the opportunity to do more, be more, how much will choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
