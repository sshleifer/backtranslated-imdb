Don't bother. A little prosciutto can be a long way, but everything we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of those buffered episodes ... the vehicle jumps into another and everything changes direction again, until we just scratch our heads, wondering if there's ever a plot. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play against a mystified Dunaway game, Lady Macbeth, lost in the Marx's Broers's Duck Soup. Oh, the raven ... now there's an actor. And there is the family member who just lies and looks spiritually. Or Dr. Dread who is full of gloomy and no working remedies. I am one of those suckers just to see a movie to the end. Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
