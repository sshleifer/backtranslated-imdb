Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot, but is destroyed by the cheesy details of the movie. I am a younger teenager and do not enjoy much of this movie. I thought the effects were terrible, but they might be entertaining for younger children. The matrix moves destroy the action, you know it was absolutely fake. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who had temporary people and homemakers in which Wendy strives to win. It ends everything like a typical good movie as Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen Yen Lo (and destroys him forever) eventually defeated. So Wendy teaches a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
