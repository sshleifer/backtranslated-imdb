I saw 'Afkoms' at the Stockholm Film Festival last night and this was a big disappointment. Disappointment as the storyline was potentially powerful was the prospect of thrilling Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie. As a fan (I sound pervious, I'm not!) From the rape / revenge movie of the 70's, I was unnecessary to be curious to watch this movie out. My conclusion: Let's stick to the classic! Yes, the storyline has potential, but the windows are flat, the actors are convincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some will say that this is a real portrayal of the patchwork in the US, that the emptiness of the characters serves a purpose and all the jazz, but it just makes the whole movie insignificant. Just like the scene where Dawson is raped: it has a serious intensity! I didn't expect anything from an 'irreversible' style, but we shouldn't feel compassion for her? I didn't. Not for a moment, she was so lame ;-) And I read that photography was impressive. Well, it's good, but nothing else. I have to admit that the show at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the movie I couldn't help thinking. "I would like to see Argento's" Inferno "again lol. near the American Canadian border in Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me ... ... the rough red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general voluptuous / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just couldn't in this movie don't come.
