Facts about National Lampoon Go to the Movies, viz. National Lampoon's Movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is poor, even according to Lampoon's typical standards. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one is going to see a movie. <br /> <br /> When I first looked at it, I began to wonder why on earth it made much less 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies' and why it was ever invented. It would be like Austin Powers 'American Guy Goes to the Movies.' How lame. He's not American, and he doesn't go to movies. None of the characters in Lampoon's so-called "satire" is funny, and no one is going to watch movies, which is a bit of a problem. I was hoping it would be something in the theater spot of Theater 3000, but it's not. <br /> <br /> It was National Lampoon's first movie to Animal House, although you couldn't tell it about the quality. of the movie. Poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it causes headaches ?? Not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that looks double the length. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed? and this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles - most likely to help it to promote to people who are too stupid to remember how badly a panning received it from home video critics in 1982/83. 'Hmm, movie madness ?? I have never heard of this movie! Let's rent it! "And then, realizing," Hey, wait a minute, it's just National Lampoon going to the movies! " <br /> <br /> It was released by MGM / UA, never released in theaters or DVDs; It sometimes appears on television several times a decade, which is just the only place you can find. <br /> <br /> It's divided into three stories ?? a parody of self-enlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality / cop-buddy movies (I think). The first segment dies Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated man who separates his wife and does other things. I'm not sure, because because it was so boring, my mind began to drift. Until the sex scene appeared. <br /> <br /> Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter (don't ask) who decides to become queen of the margarine, so she is supplying dairy products. Ouch! It contains the only funny line in the movie: "Only I can love my son!" If you think that doesn't sound funny, are you right? it is not. And just think ?? This is the highlight of this movie! Part III is about a policeman pursuing a series of killers (Christopher Lloyd) just to lose his nerve and shoot the man. It contains a funny scene, but it is extremely exaggerated? only Lloyd really shows humor, plays his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal. The part where he chokes his victim and stands the cunning cop by looking at it, at least deploys a rogue or two. <br /> <br /> It is a pity to see such a throw of semi-famous names day by day to low standards. The authors of each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and smart by spoofing so-called stereotypes ?? The mistake is that the movie becomes a big contradiction, which benefits the standard T&A instead of plot; raw humor instead of witty dialogue; Desperate appearances instead of inspired children. It's easy to see that none of the actors with the material was complicated, mumbled their lines, often so shy that they rarely make eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, as I said. for. I laughed once, just one line, and even then it was a half-hearted one. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies look like regular songs. <br /> <br /> I love National Lampoon's Vacation series (or at least three of four installments) and their classic Animal House, but they The recent death of direct-to-video bombs like Golf Punks (with great comic genius Tom Arnold) provides a good example of why their magazine was out of print more than a decade ago. It gets really old, really fast. <br /> <br /> Drying to see a new movie, called Gold Diggers, is released with their 'stamp of approval'. It was like a movie condemned before it even hit theaters? Maybe they shouldn't start advertising their name across the place. <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It gets the National Lampoon's stamp of approval. It will teach you not to make it so terrible next time. <br /> <br /> Forget about the death penalty. Just keep a lot of criminals in a room and look them over every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad I can't even explain his turbulent resentment. I give up.
