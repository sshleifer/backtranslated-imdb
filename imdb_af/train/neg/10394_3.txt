With Knight and O'Tool as leaders, this film had good potential, and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, might have a little tension. But they throw it all on foolish adventure and then later with maudlin war remnants. It was, of course, quite superficial, beautiful English land and sea or not. The number one mistake was so early in the movie, when she could easily play a few years older, rather than choosing someone ten years old. play the part. They missed all the chances of having a great deal of rivalry, and instead, they foolishly drew the easy and low-cost passion elements.
