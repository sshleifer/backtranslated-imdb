I only evaluate this movie as a 3-pity because it's worth it. I like to praise a good movie and I'm not biased towards "male" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent movie. Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a disorganized, poor, poorly written, unrealistic example of movie performance at its worst. By the end of the movie I didn't care who was lying or if something had been resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good story. This story is poor and never develops (just because the subject is deep, doesn't mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences an important character change, and is placed in the course of the movie for that change. In Georgia Rule, the character changes suddenly and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Taking a very good dynamic character is a difficult job and takes time (you only have a few hours in a movie). This means that too much effort on dynamic characters will pay little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story and the rubbish of poor dynamic characters, I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. It's good if you write American Beauty, but not when you try a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for a man (no I don't cut her slack because she was molested, miserable with everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions). The "Dudley Do Right" Mormon child had to have the thought of not harming his religion and commitments ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy left a 17-year-old girl who was molested just left , occasionally (unless he is an actor or politician). This movie is worth checking out if you want to remind yourself of what good movie making it is NOT!
