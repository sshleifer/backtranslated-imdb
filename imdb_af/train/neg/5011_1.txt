... And I never thought deserving a movie to be awarded 1! But this one is honestly the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the story since the DVD box looks pretty predictable. It's not a mystery or a youthful movie. It does not include sensuality, than what the title can remotely suggest to you. This is not a total no-no. Don't waste your time or money unless you feel like a lot of young people in such a great-gothic environment where a killer goes after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth looking at. Max Makowski makes the worst of Nick Stahl.
