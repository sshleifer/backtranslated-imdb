The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to hit your head against the wall, allow some internal bleeding of the brain, let a lot of your brain cells die and as soon as you are officially mentally handicapped, maybe * MAG * enjoy this movie <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the taxi driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they would eventually fall in love, it would have made a much nicer movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the reunion was just too much to digest. As an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have shot himself much before reaching even the airlift to confess his true love. :) But then the point of the film was to devise logic, gravity, physics. and throw an egg on the face of the * GENERAL * hearing. <br /> <br /> Look at your own danger. At least I know I have been afraid of life :(
