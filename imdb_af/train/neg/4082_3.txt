This movie was just painful to watch ... not in the good dramatic way that makes you with emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I did the last sentence as well as I did) but only in An absolute boring way for over two hours. Now, you may all think I'm just an ignorant judge who has no respect for Shakespeare or "artistic film-making". Well, you both have mistakes. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet. I watched many "arthouse" films like the surrealistic and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. .. but it was just over two hours of translated Shakespeare, WAY too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not in every other shot of a movie !!! This was unnecessary and served nothing for the story !!!), and basically just overseas movie-making. I had high expectations for this movie because it said it was "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but it was just an extreme fall. I just gave this movie a three because of the acting presence of Sir John Gielgud (who has overtaken all the names in this movie) and the combination of cinematography / set design as it made many screens, looks like moving paintings. However, much of this movie would have been better than just a painting with a scroll of the text below. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli gave the director the director would have been much better. But this is one of the audience's opinions, many others can enjoy it much more than I do. It's said, if you can't find it at any nearby video industry (it's not currently on DVD), try not to get too far from it to find it. It's not really worth it.
