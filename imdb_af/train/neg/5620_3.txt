In fact, there is no reason to investigate this much further because of some very scary and biased misleading statements. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (the author of The Book of Hebrews He claims) has no idea that Jesus is or was a human being. This allegation is also deliberately false because he accuses others or is ignorant of what the Bible says. <br /> <br /> First, we can investigate his deceptive claim on Hebrews 8.4; which he quotes: "If Jesus were on the earth, he would not be a priest," therefore he set up the ignorant and untrained viewer to accept his false premium. why? He does what most so-called Bible-believing people he accuses do the same. It's taking things out of context. <br /> <br /> verse from Hebrews 8; 1 .. "Now of the things we have spoken it is the sum: We have such a high priest set at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven. The context above is clear from a Jesus who was on earth following the alleged resurrection in heaven. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take her out of context. a foundation that Paul was not aware of a HUMAN JESUS ​​but only one in heaven follows <br /> <br /> <br /> we see if the filmmaker is honest Hebrews 7; 14 "For it is clear that our Lord has brought forth Judah; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priesthood. "<br /> <br /> Hey, did the filmmaker not only cite the writer of Hebrews trying to show the author of that book, no knowledge of a" Human Jesus "? This is probably not Paul Hebrews wrote, but I'm not going into this, but the filmmaker claims Paul did this and that is the point of departure given here. <br /> <br /> It's not like this movie maker does good points in some areas, but he does the same blind prejudice to the religion he bashes in. When he enters these tactics, he loses my credibility as a religion, he takes out, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, and a bias of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
