If you look at it now and hear all the language here, it's amazing it's PG, but it's the 1970s grading system for you. Peter Falk spits out the Name of the Lord in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet few people regard it as offensive, and certainly not the scumbags that make movies or the people they judge. <br /> <br /> The movie is a guide to how filthy this movie can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors not in the sound of music do not find. <br /> <br /> I like movie movies, and many movies by director William Friedkin, but this script doesn't deliver and it just feels too much of the "Sleazy 70s", visual and audible. For those who loved Falk in TV's "Columbo", it should come as a shock to hear that he uses as much curse as he did in films. This is far from the only case.
