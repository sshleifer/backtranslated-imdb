How can 4 out of 16 previous voters give this movie a 10? How can more than half of previous voters give it a 7 or higher? Who's voting here? I can only assume it is mostly children - very young children. The fact is that it is a bad movie in all respects. The story is stupid; the acting is hard to even think of as acting; the characters are characterless; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this one rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the unfortunate case of ever recasting, I suggest you read a book rather.
