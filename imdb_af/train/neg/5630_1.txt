The only reason I watched the movie to the end was the "hope" of seeing something interesting. The movie is really bad and the girl's performance is really really bad, honest, I'm not a film critic, but an expert, but you just need common sense to see that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The first thing that came to my mind when she started talking was: "She has a relationship with Willem Dafoe and he accepted her to help with the script and appear in her movie because she is the brilliant director. " .. Surprise, surprise, the next day after watching the movie, I found out on the internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Awful story and terrible achievement.
