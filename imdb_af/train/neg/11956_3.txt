This movie stinks. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has so much increased in shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the scene was slim. It could have been a good movie. I think it relied only on his grotesque footage. I can usually handle graphical scenes and human taboo, but it felt that Miike shot it to shoot it. Just a poorly executed movie. There is nothing to entertain by watching this movie unless you are fascinated by exercising yourself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-indulgence, parents and brothers and sisters, and faecal spread. I think I sold the movie to many of you, but I meant it when I said it stinks. He managed to play in other movies, but I think you'll be better off watching someone poop.
