I had to give this movie 1 because it's so bad, but don't think I didn't enjoy watching, because I laughed and laughed, and I even had a few questions. So half the time I laughed, half the time I said, "What's going on in hell?" or "why would anyone do this?" et cetera. I mostly enjoyed the horrific effects, the 80s style naive scene / battle / dialogue / nude scene, and the way the warriors hit swords in the wind as they ride their horses. And there are some crazy model effects (it's not supposed to be real trees, are they?) And I still don't understand this guy who gets them in the cave, what in hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I'd give it a try, and basically I liked the movie like people like Ed Wood movies. I have no real pleasure from what the film meant, I look at it in my own hilarious way. So don't distract it, if you really thought it was an action movie, that is, I just kept it for other reasons. It is much, much worse than the evil dead, so it can actually make you think of wasting your life by looking at it (which came to my mind a few times). I think the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks, have friends, and laugh at this movie. Maybe it's a little difficult, but I don't think so, rent it and you'll see. Yo.
