How did it become a clash? Dear God I don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much. The movie was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the actions of some characters. The movie was too bright, they had to do something about the lighting, eg. darkens the environment. Forming certain dead characters has made this movie look like a 1970s horror. This is 2006! People are not afraid of other people wearing heavy creeps. Most of the horror scenes we take from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total rounding! That's why I don't watch tagalog movies. The only reason so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is due to conformity. How many times should we copy scenes from The Ring and improvise that it comes from the TV instead of the girl, is it coming out of the window next to it? No matter how you sit, it's another discount. If you want a good horror movie, check out the 50 best horror movie listed on this site.
