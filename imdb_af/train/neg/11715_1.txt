haha! you just have to smile and smile if you really made it through the movie. It says something about myself, I think. The movie itself was created. I think as a kind of psychological test, or like some kind of drug, to bring you to a place you've never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece, the tractacus (sp?) Said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, it will take you to a new level, such as a doctrine, and then you can throw work away and see things with clarity and true understanding. This movie is the same I think. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in such a unique way. First of all, these are snipes. I loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies. and I suffered from some weak. Although you know the movie can suck, you will never think it can be as bad as it actually was. what's the fun of it. I mean it's snipes. You know it can be good, but it'll be fine, right? smile. <br /> <br /> So this thing at every level is pure boredom, pure unoriginal. The reference to the professionals is both dead and obvious, yet bad to be comic. there is not one character in this movie that is at least interesting. and to make the whole thing more surreal, they have a soundtrack that sounds like parts of different Bourne identity types movies, just not quite right. In fact, although it looks close to active movie background music, it just happens that it is done in a way that will look great. <br /> <br /> then all the scenes are in total pitch black, where frankly as the characters are so flat, you don't really care about what is going to happen, but no matter after it happens and someone is killed, You just tell yourself, should I see it? what else? How about spectacular lightnings, trivial strobe-light torches, for too long to carry. let's throw it. But how are you? When you can't handle tension and your eyes no longer, some of these die in the dark when you really don't see what happened. And besides, let's see the face you don't mind. you were bored far from the start. <br /> <br /> I drove in and out a few times, but I almost caught this movie. And it becomes something you can see, without anything that enters your mind at any level. So it becomes something that you can effectively zoned and start thinking about your life, where it goes, where it is, what we are people. <br /> <br /> And that ... this is the real magic of this movie.
