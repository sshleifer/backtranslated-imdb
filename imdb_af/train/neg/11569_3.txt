Even if you subscribe to the knee-jerk anti-free trade policy of this movie, it's just the same tired note, which is played again and again. Sounds sound. Even if you can accept a minister with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles, Reverend Billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure. The clownish reverberation is the kind that wakes up every morning without any aspiration more ethereal than seeing its own face on TV before going to bed overnight. He has a beautiful woman, I must admit, but it will take more than that to save this arid mess of a movie. The interminable bus rides are the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - through a colored line moving over a map. Oh, you guess. Oh yes, it has the virtue to be short. Is this the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yeah, so scared.
