The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three big movies and really started making a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studio had to experiment to see how the public liked it most. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another short, interesting movie that keeps people's attention and keeps their minds off the depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful movies. <br /> <br /> Despite this, none of the above has been achieved, despite Gary Cooper's and Carole Lombard's star conditions and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts here that just get boring, and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To get it off, you didn't get the normal feeling-good end that the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
