There are probably more people who are afraid of the dentist than of, we say, little monsters or scary puppets. It makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for many years, but if he cheats his wife with the pool on him, he understands and brings his anger and frustration to his work. Well, give a crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what happens next. <br /> <br /> As I said, it has a brilliant idea, but not as good as it did. In particular, the end is a major departure. Last Comment: Look for Mark Ruffalo (You can look at my eternal sunshine ...) in this one. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
