One has to wonder if at any stage in the production of this movie there was a <br /> <br /> script that made sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours <br /> <br /> long and was it cut off in the incoherent mess that survives? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone fund this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a nice young man and he does what he can <br /> <br /> with the dialogue and dramatic situations he has given. But <br /> <br /> characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity does not exist, and acting, cinematography and direction are (up to <br /> <br /> courtesy) amateuristies. Not one sleep is an unfortunate <br /> <br /> choice of title, as it will probably be untrue if someone actually tries to watch this movie.
