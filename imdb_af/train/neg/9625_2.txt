This movie offers absolutely no imagination in the premise or in its execution, but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so-called comedy that has no energy to speak. The story is about nit-picky about the analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), who thinks his new wife, Lisa (Debra Messing), arrived with him after just one day on their honeymoon with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria). Upon returning home, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) went to a party and ran to Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) who had been to school with them for years. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER Alert ***** Polly is forgetful and messy and lives carefree. This is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person, but they start to date and Reuben is starting to change as a person when he starts trying out new things like salsa dance. and eat spicy foods. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to marry Reuben, but he really doesn't want to, but Polly decides to leave because she doesn't believe in marriage. <br /> <br /> This film is the second director of John Hamburg who wrote two generally unfair screens in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but these two movies look like classic compared to this steel piece of drift. It's very easy to say that something is not funny, but I think with this movie it's even easier to find out why. This movie is completely and completely predictable from start to finish with every scene that seems to be just happening because of the ridicule of writing. Hamburg, who also wrote the script, wrote it without thinking that it was anything else and sometimes he seemed to be trying to generate the same energy as "There is something about Mary", but the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny? If you do, it's easy! A few times during the film, characters inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything, but everything they achieve is the obvious one. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he should work less and wait for the better scripts to get away, because this film doesn't work as a comedy or as a romance.
