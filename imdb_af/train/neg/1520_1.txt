Why did I waste my time with this movie? There wasn't a single funny joke or line throughout. The slapstick wasn't even funny. I mean, really, an out-of-control vacuum cleaner pipe? Why is the National Lampoon's name attached to this movie? Even Christmas holiday was better than that (I actually thought the movie was very funny). <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
