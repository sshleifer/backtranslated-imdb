"Sleepwalkers" is the first film that Stephen King wrote in writing. Given this, and the excellent Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie, you would expect a strange and ultimately viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you will get. The thing is, they probably made it a good movie. The beginning is intriguing with the small town's haunting atmosphere. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the movie. The movie becomes funny for no apparent reason! From that moment on, the whole atmosphere of "sleepwalkers" is destroyed. For those who have seen it, who can ever forget good old Johnny who has "COP CAB! After you put the pencil in one's head?!? I just rented it again to see if Mabye was wrong for the first time, given how originally the plot sounded, but I was right. & Johnny got song, I gave it a 2.
