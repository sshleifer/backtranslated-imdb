This movie reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", another artwork film with a violent and radical approach to human nature. I didn't like the movie, but I can't say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also remind myself of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a lot of low class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters who do not fit together. I also thought of the books of French writer Emile Zola, who was a writer of the style of naturalism. I didn't like the movie and I don't like the people in it either. They all look so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One can ask the question why they live, they seem to be a big farce member on this planet forced to live against their will. Or you could say hell is on this world.
