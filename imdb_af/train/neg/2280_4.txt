This is the nature of businesses trying to capitalize on the success of others. Here is a movie that contains elements of the earlier 'Dracula' (1931) and 'Frankenstein' (1931). In a Germanic town, village leaders believe that vampires (in the form of bats) are the cause of the recent death of bloodless victims. Although shot at Universal (and at the Bronson caves!), It is a poverty driving feature; It is not fair to compare it to the earlier, more affordable and better movies. <br /> <br /> From the well-known and exciting, different music of the main titles (which should have been by Mischa Bakalienikoff), through the talky but well-done opening sequence, we expect the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good 30-year-old movie. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen. This is the disappointment. <br /> <br /> We get a little more than the formal elements of such movies, but with a low rate, low budget, not enough of Dwight Frye, the exaggerated presence of Maude Eburne (Auntie Gussie) and the premier for Lionel Atwill (Dr von Niemann) to demand human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazier), never became clear. <br /> <br /> Don't look at the technique column. X '(1932) - who also dies Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, but as father and daughter - before I see it as I did; It's an Oscar winner in comparison. So first look at this one. Structurally, 'The Vampire Bat' is still not that good. It comes with too much talk or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing strongly on the vampire villain. <br /> <br /> Except 'Dr. X 'and' Mystery of the Wax Museum '(both 1932 and co-starring Fay Wray), Lionel Atwill's best-known appearance is the one armed bandage in' Son of Frankenstein '(1939) and as Moriarity in Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon (1943). Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in 'Dracula' (1931). As the "young lovers," Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene, but it's about it. He can be seen in 'The Old Dark House' (1932), and Fay is dragged by Joel McCrea in 'The Most Dangerous Game' (1930). Then there is her 1933 classic 'screamer'. Worse more time, money and rewriting were not available for this movie to better display the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, this dramatic disappointing movie only gets 4.
