Umm .. I was rather surprised that someone actually gave this movie high marks. <br /> <br /> We see it ... Tori Spelling is not a big actress. And this movie just proves the scale of her talent. "The movie's plot was weak. I'm sure the thirst that came up with this concept was some twisted peeping tom. If there's a good thing about this movie, I would say it's Tommy Chong's daughter just because she's his daughter ... and then there is soap opera-ish male head who looks decent, makes him somewhat attractive, but stops helping his dramatic abilities * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many ways can you simply say, "This movie sucks"?
