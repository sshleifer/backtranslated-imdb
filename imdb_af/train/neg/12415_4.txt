I don't remember, "Barnaby Jones" is no more than a mere, standard detective show in which, according to any Quinn Martin show, I was the murder. Law II was the main character found in the murder. Law III was the plot turn (another character murdered), Law IV was the decision and the Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) and her father-in-law, Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen), asked how he figured out the crime and someone who did something funny at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the excellent theme song of the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Oddly enough, the opening credit sequence showed me how the show was over and for the seven seasons the show was on the air. I would also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role to Jed Clampett, despite Ebsen's poor miscarriage. I just wished that the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I interviewed composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of the American Television Channel. Let's just say I was more than Goldsmith about the show "Barnaby Jones."
