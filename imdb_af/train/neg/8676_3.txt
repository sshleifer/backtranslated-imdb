Avoid the US version. It's with more American footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard from New York's amateurs. The dubbing is so bad that it looks like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy from the Bronx has Chiba's voice. I couldn't watch the whole movie, it was so bad. Instead of this American version, see Chiba's other greetings like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
