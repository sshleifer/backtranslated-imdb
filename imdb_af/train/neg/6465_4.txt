This Charles outing is decent, but it's a very low key performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland forgetting to develop and it hurts the movie a bit. I'm still trying to find out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with 'Charles' was pretty bad.
