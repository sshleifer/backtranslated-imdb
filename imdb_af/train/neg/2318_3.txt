Bokkie, found as a baby in the garbage and educated at a martial arts academy, has a talent for sinking. With the help of the man who got him, he came to college and was promoted to the championship while looking for his real parents. Infinitely better in action comedy is a real mess as a whole. It seems like it's a hooker basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is scatter shot. The focus is more than a Chihuahua with ADD on a quadruple espresso. I still asked what "I look". I watched it from start to finish and still don't know what the hell happened. It's a pity because there are some good action scenes, some funny jokes and the opportunity, but nothing, nothing ever comes together, I'll make a pass.
