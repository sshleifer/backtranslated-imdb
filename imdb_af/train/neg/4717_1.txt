And how it made it into production, amazed me. The main character is an unpleasant performance that is not the least funny. I can't wear the character at all. He's a stupid one with nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> It's the worst cartoon on the surface for the past 10 years, no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as those on Disney's Sweet Life by Zack and Cody. I couldn't bear this show anymore, it's terrible and needs to be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse. <br /> <br /> It is as if this show was written by some 15-year-olds who based the character on themselves and think they are hot when they are really just arrogant and lacking. creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go away and fast!
