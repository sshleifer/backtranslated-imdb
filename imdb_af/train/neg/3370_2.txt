Just a stupid old movie. First Stanwyck's son gets his foot caught in a very stupid way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another very stupid way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck unfortunately gets back, and comes across an escaped offender. She has the chance to kill him but fails in a very stupid way. In the end, her husband is being saved, and Stanwyck tells us what the silly message of the movie is. Everyone is good, but ends up stupid. <br /> <br /> I could never find out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it a leading lady in Hollywood's glamorous Golden Age; that nose is so beautiful ?? So photogenic ?? The movie is gracious and runs a little over an hour. It's as if the director felt that he was making, so he thought it was best to keep the shit short.
