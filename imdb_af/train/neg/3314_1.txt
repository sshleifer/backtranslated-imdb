Reading all these positive reviews, I find myself amazed. How did it enjoy so much that I consider to be a terribly bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the movie, already mentioned in some reviews; Put simply, this is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess of opening credits to the killing end. <br /> <br /> While many characters mis-cast and not Ewan McGregor or Toni Collette put in a performance that's worthy of them, the worst is far Paltrow. I enjoyed much of her performance in some roles, but here's his horror - she is self-conscious, nose, slouching and completely disconnected from her characters and those around her. A very disappointing effort - although even a perfect Emma couldn't save this movie.
