This is exactly why many people remain homeless. . . because dumb producers pay their money to make such horrible movies instead of donating if they can bother! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white chicks! Little Man has a pain apology for the appearance of a character lunch as a baby. Story is terrible as it is written by six people. However, the idea would not be bad, if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode. It has funny moments, but some of them are over and some are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. So was the director. Anyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. It is racist and very offensive to midgets. I mean, instead of having sympathy with them, the filmmakers make their fun! It really makes me do what they do. They see that midgets are just like babies. And for a character who is a little kid, as if it were an abandoned baby, just to get a diamond from a certain family. This is his excuse to show such a thing. It just wasn't worth it. Don't see this movie. This is a great waste of time and money.
