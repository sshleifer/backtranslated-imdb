Worst movie on earth. I don't even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing them with this movie. When it comes to acting and relief, this movie is similar to a bad porn without sex. The actors are the worst I have ever seen, and could not have been worse, even if they are trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. The movie should be a record that has the lowest budget, which I am sure, wasted almost exclusively on the film's cover. This movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage films. I want to point out that no other movie is even being compared. I personally feel responsible for the suggestion of a friend and I look at this movie and am surprised that she still sees me a friend after the pain I have put through us. Don't see this movie!
