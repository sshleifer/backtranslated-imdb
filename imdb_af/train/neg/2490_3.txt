Whatever a sad face this TV stable warts makes, the watch runs out on their careers that bump over a little rustle of a ship boat, perhaps more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and loose, and it's not helped by a "big name" star who can barely spit out the few lines he credibly gave. <br /> <br /> supporting cast above the material; they clearly look at the clock here. Exit the screens, get the pay check, go home, and try to forget about it. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly badly written or filmed; There are no real clogs, it is just totally anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small rope of extras. The pacing is a bit bizarre; An embarrassing preliminary romantic subplot only begins after the main action begins, making it feel irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage scored a few points to be properly scored and to be a fun game of "mocking the Kiwi bit parties"; Most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The worst thing about this production is that this movie is probably their big break.
