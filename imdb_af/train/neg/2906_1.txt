-There can be spoiled ... but believe me, this movie spoils him from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I went with this high expectation in this movie. It was my own fault. I've had too much stock in Steve Carell's record to date. 40-year-old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The office. And I made the mistake of going to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. It has always been a very good predictor in the past, but something has definitely been going on lately. The last time I had embarrassed it and in so much pain in a kiosk, I looked at Blue Steel in 1990. <br /> <br /> This movie whispered from start to finish. The script was good material. Awful writes everywhere. "Killer of Love"? "Love is an ability"? Anyone who wrote this crap suffered from the same misery the American Beauty writer got ... tried waaaaayyyyyy too hard. The whole movie was praised by Three's Company'ish moments like the horrible and confronted crash scene. Or the useless / confusing aerobics scene. Or the terrible washroom scene. Right if you think something serious and / or really is going to happen, throw them in one of these terrible moments. And it happens over and over and over. <br /> <br /> And what is Carell's character? The man meets a little break at a bookstore and is suddenly in love with heels on the head? Let's look at it. Their conversation sucked. They both had to say their farewell after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune to watch this movie .... Carell's character tries to say something that is absolutely random and unavailable (I think the exact line was "this time I was a kid"). .. this is it serious, but both laugh so hard that coffee is emitting their noses. The actors themselves seemed to be in pain and wondered why they were directed to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Back to the IMDb thing ... you need to find a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. I know this is impossible, but it is painfully obvious that the first 20 or so ratings / reviews were also posted by 12-year-olds, or by flunkies hired by the studio. Look at The Family Stone's rating ... if it's a middle of 5, then it should be absolutely a 2 ... and it pushes it.
