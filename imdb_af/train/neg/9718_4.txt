An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a one-night stand with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). She looks at a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) who is attacked outside, but she cannot call the police because it will blow her marriage to Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). So, Guttenberg, an honest citizen he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed just half an hour later, comes forward and claims to have seen the first attack. He just wanted to surrender the information Huppert had given him. Never carry a false witness against your neighbor as they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police to a killer is quickly turned. When he meets the first near-victim, McGovern, she immediately cuts what has happened, but agrees to remain silent for the moment. But then Guttenberg finds himself in court, to identify the heavy (Greenquist) and through cross-examination he discovers that he is close and cannot identify objects remotely, let alone faces. (Not that it matters, because he never saw the crawl in the first place.) The plot is almost labyrinthine. Guttenberg blows up the main suspect when Huppert is also murdered. <br /> <br /> He almost shoots arrest and goes with the now-sympathetic McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern hatch a plan to capture the killer. She will serve as bait. They'll follow the flag-like creep in one of his tough ghost and McGovern will act like the doxy that the killer is attracted to just trying to kill her. But everything will be fine, see, because not only will Guttenberg watch her. Not only will he wake up the police for a few minutes after entering the dive, but she will keep a can. case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, the warning builder, unfold this scenario as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has a very interesting bone structure. She sometimes looks all the male and small mouths, but she is alive. Steve Guttenberg has hair on his brawn and it's about it. Otherwise, he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can act, it's not clear in this movie. The killer is so shaped and so cared that he looks like he is wearing one of those malformations in the Twilight Zone episode of greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Didn't the director, Curtis Hanson, continue to make "LA Confidential"? It was a nice piece of work. Here everything looks clumsy and confronted, to the small pieces. Just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniform police officer is set to delay McGovern's rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen shared a bit as a late shopper. He is a neat old and always reliable. Paul Shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that looks like the stage and he also does a good job. <br /> <br /> The lukewarm joint where McGovern draws the attention of the killer, where his pool plays with a few hairy monkeys is shot at a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where I didn't live. The way in which the interior is erected is clear that it is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive. Actually, it looks rather more elegant on the screen than in reality. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the Hitchcock area and it causes tears to think what he did with this story.
