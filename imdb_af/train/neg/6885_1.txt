... in an otherwise horrible, wrong, unpredictable comedy. <br /> <br /> I was the only victim at a 7:20 screen tonight (3 days after the film opened), so there is some satisfaction knowing that movie warnings have been heard. <br /> <br /> The bloom is from Jon Heder's rose. The rising double chin is not his fault; but his geeky child kicks into another bad wig, but does not work. It would be another crime if it were Eli Wallach's last screen appearance. Diane Keaton will probably survive to take this pay card - basically because so few have seen the worst vehicle in recent weeks. <br /> <br /> Tonight I came alone in the theater. I became alive. (laughed even) when Daniels was given latitude to render the film's only three-dimensional character. He is really one of our best actors. <br /> <br /> In summary, even Jeff Daniels's work cannot solve this picture.
