I was lying on my bed, with a very bad cold or flu or whatever. I think maybe, I'll kill a little to watch some horror movies my mom bought me for a while. I wish I never chose this movie! After watching it, I felt even more sick and wanted to throw. Afterwords (when of course I got better) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis was nothing like the rights in the movie. I hope no one will ever watch this movie, but if they ever do, eat, or you will feel the way I felt after I first watched it. I think you will have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least the movie had better reviews on this site.
