It's really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story that combines all sorts of things that don't make sense. It just looks like a wrong experiment. Secondly, the actors cannot play realistically. They can't even talk if an actor has to. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with it now?
