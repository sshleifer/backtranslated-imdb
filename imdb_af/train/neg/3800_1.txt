The name of the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in film history is not an easy task, candidates are so abundant, but Nemesis 2 was my personal favorite since I saw it. It was so funny that we had to rent again the next day, and again I laughed so hard that I was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty Python's Scott from Antarctica.) <br /> <br /> In the whole movie, the viewer gets stuck. I'm completely ashamed that this awkward home video ever made it into production. It's supposed to be a successor, but doesn't have a clear connection to the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time, "Alex" is female, although it took us halfway into the movie to stop guessing, wearing all the muscles and the barbarian-nomad outfit! <br /> <br /> There's not a plot at all, it's just a long chase, but it's so slow and pointless to call it a chase, it makes it much more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which takes into account its quality as well, and then suddenly suddenly comes to a blatant action scene with many petrol explosions, without ever really explaining what it is all about. Fortunately, it never gets boring, because there is something stupid and fake at all times! <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually just boring, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect blend of excessive and utterly unintended wackiness that it is truly entertaining. Rent this movie or even buy it, you won't be disappointed!
