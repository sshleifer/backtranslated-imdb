Standard procedure for Swedish movies today seems to start throwing plausibility out of the window and stopping the road for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a movie that makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are robbed of a highly effective "military style" gang of robbers. Two police officers begin investigating the case that will soon become more complicated than it would have been. <br /> <br /> As usual in the Swedish movie, the cast is mostly from the same people you have seen over and over. Mikael Persbrandt must have been in every Swedish movie for the past few years! But that's good, I think since Persbrandt is one of the few that performs well here (as he usually does). The problems with this movie mostly revolve around the story itself. First, the robberies usually feel like background. It is rather a movie about a young police officer fighting to prove herself in a masculine world (as it was not made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). There is also an incredible plot turn around near the end that looks like alien landing. But still I thought it was a very nice touch, as I was about half asleep. It crawled a bit (and actually saved the score from another step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the biggest problem is the same as with most other Swedish films of this kind. Simply, the action and the tension do not meet the standards we are accustomed to other films of this nature (mostly Hollywood). It feels cheap and rather poor in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget to try to make Hollywood action light as they do now. Because this is another unforgettable effort by the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
