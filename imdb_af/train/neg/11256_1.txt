What a waste of time! I tried about 6 times to sit through Sky Captain and every time, within about 3 minutes, I started doing something else. Anything else! It's a straight-boring movie, the acting is awful, and of course a director for the first time, because it's stiff. And I wanted it. I love sci-fi, the old stone hangers, and I can appreciate the effort to nod to Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God, a waste of money. I worked for Paramount Pictures, and I wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen testing. She told me they never had any interest or need to do it. This piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993, but had to forget her own advice when she grew this dog. Blue screen shot an effect, but not a whole movie. We should not forget that Jude or Jolie are also great actors (but easy on the eye). Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - it can work, but only under a skilled director. The funny thing is, the captain's director will still get work even after this drink. It's trade, not art!
