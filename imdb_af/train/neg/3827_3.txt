Stereotype, derived, inexorable and boring Western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) give both performances far from their best and justify it; they both have superficial roles and characteristics, mainly through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "looked the world better than it used to be" and Coburn is a ban that "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt". In addition, Heston is so old that he struggles to ride a horse and Coburn is mean and difficult, but not like a killer who is cold-blooded like some of the minor villains. Apparently, the filmmakers can't even come up with ONE original idea about how to distinguish this movie at all. (* 1/2)
