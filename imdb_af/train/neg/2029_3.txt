I don't see enough TV games to understand the attraction of SHOW ME THE GONE, but I think it appeals to unbeatable audiences. Actually a quiz show, it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions. However, the quiz elements only play a small role in the proceedings, which I find complicated. For example, before answering a question, a participant selects the question to be asked by choosing between the random "A," "B" or "C" choices. Does it work for any purpose other than delaying the game? It would be much faster to just "A." to start. Participants can submit questions, but must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the participant is asked to include the answer - another delay tactic. The competitor's next task is to mention which woman of about a dozen go-go dancers is in a cage to reveal a map indicating how much the question is worth. A correct answer adds the card's dollar figure to the participant's current total. An incorrect answer subtracts the same sum. This time-consuming step actually has some entertainment value, as it allows the audience to take a look at the slenderly dressed and uniformly beautiful dancers. Meanwhile, the contestant is reminded that an unfortunate choice of "murder card" will immediately end the game. It obviously sweats the participant and causes further delays, as the nerve participant is considering the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the appeal's main hearing. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the whole process is even more delayed by a very empty rogue between host William Shatner and the contestant, along with occasional routines by the cast dancers. All these delays burn so much time that it's possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute JEOPARDY episode often gets as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM I watched have only received six questions (many of which relate to other TV shows). No one in his good mind will look at this show, as it is nice to play together by answering the questions at home. It leaves three possible reasons to watch the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a participant responds to be about to win as much as one million dollars, you just have to lose in one shot. <br /> <br /> B. Looking at beautiful young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. Enjoying William Shatner's brilliant banter. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but the women are not long enough to justify the suffering by an hour of this show.
