This movie was banned in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others have done much worse and continued since ... <br /> <br /> this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70's or early 80's horror movie . beautiful girls (who can't act to save their lives), a terrible lightning storm with a gigantic precipitation, a rogue, a crazy brother wandering around the head of the family and actually a nice damn turn . but banned? seriously. when the English parliament banned this movie, the Italians probably laughed at their joint asses, how backward and careful the British were. <br /> <br /> There were maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore that was very much underneath. There was nudity, but no sex, though generations were made after sex, of course. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. As it stands, the movie is entertaining, but the lack of image and sound quality goes away from the end result. <br /> <br /> Banned ... what a joke ...
