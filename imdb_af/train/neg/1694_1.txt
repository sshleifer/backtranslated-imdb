This movie may look like ads, but the real movie was a reason to vomit. It is a below-average (even lower than that) and has no plot. I mean, every home can scare you and sure, a dead Japanese woman will scare you, but what? Make a movie that will appeal to viewers and not just show pictures of scared people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say: A horrible rip-off from Samara (The Ring)? Don't start me with the "dead child". Not even so scary! Approximately? He has a cat and he can imitate it, great freaking deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be harmed by the Grudge! 10/01! Bah! >. <
