Now, it would be a kind of clich√© if I started with the bit about the title, so I'm waiting for it. First, this movie made me wonder why children do dumb things like walking around in labs and breaking bottles. Then I realized this, it's a movie with a message, the message is beating kids and things like this won't happen. Things like you ask? Things like a giant insect sample grow up and cause a bit of chaos before they die in the typical "kill the monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has nothing Blue in it or any Simian of any kind. Now it looks like I'm cheated or anything. The picture on the cover had a huge bug / scratch / idiot / thing in front that followed some screaming nurses. That kind of happened, but I wanted monkeys! I only enjoyed a few nights before most EXTREME PRIMATE (half drunk on Cask and Creame's brandy spirit). I was in the mood for more monkey hijackings 80's style. Not so much. If you like monkeys or blue stuff, this movie is not for you. If you like insects and good reasons to hit children, rent it.
