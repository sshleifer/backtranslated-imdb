It reminds me when I was a born-again believer who would be a minister. I never actually thought I'd be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive. I will run away to Heaven before it ever happens. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a lot of junk. I am now an atheist, and it just proves that the "once saved, always saved" doctor who tells Christians to us is no more than elves. If that was true, why did I leave many years ago to be a believer's born again believer? Yes, I'm really saved. I prayed the foolish sinners with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians had to read their Bible, they would find that they think God is rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities, he says. They may be surprised to learn that no where the word "rapture" is called.
