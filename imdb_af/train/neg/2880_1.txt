I've never watched such a movie. The only rescue was the fast forward feature on the DVD unit. It was like watching a poorly crafted CBC movie. There was, of course, no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, screenwriters, editors, actors. Oh, there was absolutely no story! I have to write ten lines of comment ... Bad, terrible, horrible, miserable, frightening, boring, sly, uncomfortable, sick, despair, disgusting, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, smelly, smelly -tumbs-down, and I don't know if I can continue to complete all ten lines just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was!
