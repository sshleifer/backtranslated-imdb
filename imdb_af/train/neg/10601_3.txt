This is the official successor to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was revived under several dead Vietnam war vehicles to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, it is about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter over that age. Now he works with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisol 2500, for some reason, the latest Unisol 2500. As usual, something goes wrong: the super-computer on the site (called Seth - like the snake in King Cobra the same year), orders the Unisols, and even loads the computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We look at the next step in evolution, people! Most of Van Damme's fights are with a very common Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps coming: let him leave a building - not good; run him off with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forget it! Much of the humor is tracked over how Van Damme is now outdated and outdated (he even goes gray around the sides). But even though he takes a lickin, he keeps on kicking! Most successors of this kind are a bit lame - pale imitations of the original, and while this one is certainly not a brilliant blow, it is consistently driving entertaining, especially if you are a pro-struggling fan.
