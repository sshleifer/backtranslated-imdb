This movie is so horrible, it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> Initially, the story is so ridiculous. A smalm man can write a better plot! The actors are boring and undoubtedly, perhaps they are obliged to play in this cheese film. <br /> <br /> The camera entertainment of the National Forest is the only good thing in this whole movie. I have to feel ashame because I paid for this lousy Picture. <br /> <br /> Hopefully no one makes a successor or makes a similar movie with such a worse story :-)
