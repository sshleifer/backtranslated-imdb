I love Columbo and have seen almost all the episodes, but this one is undoubtedly the worst of the lot. A surprisingly boring, useless, confused pile of irreconcilable drift that wastes the viewer's time and the acting talents of an extremely bored Peter Falk. The plot, as it is, seems to agree with the movie, not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with. Part of the proceedings that I found extremely mysterious (or possibly annoying) was that Peter Falk's character was introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the producers insisted on keeping Columbo's name a secret, why couldn't they have completely omitted this line because it sounds ridiculous? As I said, it's the wells and all true Columbo fans will do well to avoid it like the pest.
