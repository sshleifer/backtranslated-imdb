Thanks, I looked at a friend's place and didn't pay it. The plot is terribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show. If you are familiar with computers or electronics, watch out. You will feel that the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Also, actress has a lot of music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst acting I've ever seen, except porn. She is fortunate that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He's the one wearing the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate wasting nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a pity they call it a successor, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
