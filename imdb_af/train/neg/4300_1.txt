Buford's Beach Bunnies gives B-grade T&A movies a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was terrified of trying to exploit the young actress talents. I refer specifically to the clear lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What is the next generation of sad teenage boys watching it on late-night TV supposed to think?
