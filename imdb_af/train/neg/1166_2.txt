Having seen Versus before, I had high expectations for Alive. The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Live didn't deliver. VERY slow development. Lots of potential with the throw and the cool footage. The point of departure was intriguing, but the payout did not compensate for the build-up. Could have done so much more at the end. Most of the movie is just "sitting around". To put it plainly, three of us were officially going to sit down and watched this movie and with the 50-minute point we struggled to close it to the end. It really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for Ichi's Killer or Versus type battles, then save yourself $ and a lot of disappointment.
