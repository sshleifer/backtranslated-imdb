"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students coming over Dracula's body. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal his blood for the auction, it is an offer they can Dracula II: Ascension "is a bit of entertaining horror movie that has many errors The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is pretty average, some good gore effects like a very cool double-deck scene, but there is not enough violence for my taste, and the movie gets boring and forgetful and there is absolutely no strain, so if you like modern vampire flashes, give it a look, I prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from the 60's and early 70's such as "Lips of Blood", "The Brides of Dracula" or "Lemora: A Child 's supernatural languages ​​"to name only a few.4 out of 10.
