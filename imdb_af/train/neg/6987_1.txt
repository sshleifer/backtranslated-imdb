I'm all for the idea of ​​a great epic of the American Revolutionary War. It is not so. (And neither was the Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I split.) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie just before it at the public MGM Studios (now Sony) out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the acclaimed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE FAME). All Pacino was the lead. <br /> <br /> But it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats, whispering remarkable comments on Pacino's horrible misconduct - he had to be an American borderman of Scottish descent (!) - and that by Nastassja Kinski, who was allegedly recently emigrated to England (!!). Then the story started and it all retired quickly. <br /> <br /> Motivations were stunned, dialogue was atrocious, events had no historical or political context. What happened to a plot came on an absurd coincidence; By the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into one another, it became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland has a unhinged performance as a British officer / pederast. His accent was also on the map. I suspect there were no English actors available. <br /> <br /> Many people remained. Those who stayed tried to pinch giggles, then poured openly. I got it stuck - I thought the scenes could be at least good. I was wrong. Hudson chose it inexplicably to film them with handcuffs, not even Steadicam, who had a misplaced news rule "authenticity" that destroyed the scale. <br /> <br /> There was a semi-famous TV judge in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could say he was harassed by the behavior of the rest of us. And surely, on his television segment the next day, he gave the movie a '10' on his infamous Franklin scale of 1 to 10, while noticing the louts that disrupted the performance the previous night. I know art when they see it. What a buffoon. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino hasn't stared in another movie for nearly 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career has never recovered. You can't say I didn't warn you.
