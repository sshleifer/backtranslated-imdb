I looked at my mom and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We didn't find it at all. I may be wrong, but a chair has something to do with the death of the woman's father. The movie was terrible! It's not a movie for those who love a good movie. Bad suspense movies! * shake reed at film * I never see it again. And I'm also a big fan of lifetime movies! They just have to stop making movies out of books. It makes me crazy! <br /> <br /> And Whit was ugly, and yet she loved him more than Hugh, who looks a little bit TINY. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
