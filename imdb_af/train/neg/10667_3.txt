Don't be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified extras. Their scenes are probably filmed one day or so. Whatever their motives for this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, make better use of him. For me, this is a sign of bad direction through and through. The plot itself wasn't that bad. And the acting of most actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr, however, was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since it's meant to be a serious movie that can't be a good thing. The action scenes weren't bad, but they didn't have that special punch to make it more exciting. Again better direction was needed. Also, the pacing was wrong for a movie like this. It took nearly half an hour to get into action. For an action thriller of just 90 minutes too far. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. She does her best to make it work. Too bad the director hung her up. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a good director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to pull it off. And for a caliber action / stunt coordinator you would expect at least more exciting action scenes. Don't waste your time with this one. Avoid!
