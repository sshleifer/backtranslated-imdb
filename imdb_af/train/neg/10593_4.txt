The infamous Ed Wood "classic" Plan 9 Outside space has an indignant alien calling mankind, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid!" I must say exhibit A in that trial is likely to be this movie, a ridiculous silly sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Falling action star Jean Claude Van Damme returns to a hit role for him from the original film, Luke, a former Universal Soldier who is now really making good universal soldiers. While Van Damme was too big to repeat the role in the first two pursuers, he was too small to do anything by the time the fourth movie in the Universal Soldier series started. So, probably, under his breath, cries, kicks and grunts and shouts through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. You will find many mindless violence, but I advise you to get a mind control for your brain at the door when you look at this thing. Otherwise, you are responsible for forgetting where you left it by the time it was over. <br /> <br /> Luke is being called into action against more Universal Soldiers to a very really VERY evil computer called Seth (making HAL like Gandhi) turning all other universal soldiers into evil, inexorable killers. Of course, these things are programmed to do, but in this case they kill their creators, not the enemy, so that's a problem. <br /> <br /> I love the silly logic of this movie. Logic that believes a supercomputer would create a body for itself that is considered as shy of Michael Jai White, is in this movie. Logic that dictates the creator of Seth to be a blue-haired cyber-stereotype geek that more often emits the cliches than Old Faithful, does steam. Logic that has a climatic karate struggle contains two characters that kick each other, although ten separate panes of shattering glass are in three-minute screen time. <br /> <br /> The film also features a daughter in danger character, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a Universal Soldier, and a romance so approached, I think the writers who thought about romance, was actually a good thing. And when this movie ends, it ends. Not a minute after a gigantic everlasting blast is the credits going on. No epilogue, no where are they now, no final kiss, just blast, hug, ear. Even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> While not a Plan 9, US: TR is a dull little thing about an action movie that will be fun at parties full of rough Van Damme fans who like to keep their hero see, really reaches new depths. Not seen on a serious stomach.
