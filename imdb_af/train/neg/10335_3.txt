Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo means it's pretty bad by normal standards, but is relieved by its solid build-up and a few finer touches such as a neat time-lapse on vision and clarity issues. <br /> <br /> The well-known weaknesses of the genre are in full gear: banal dialogue, woodworking, illogical plot points. And the final is going to be far too long, while the denial is a little lame or will I say: a slack thing. <br /> <br /> However, Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing. Yellow clues wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 limping killers
