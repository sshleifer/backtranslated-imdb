Oh, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. These infamous Italian are the most <br /> <br /> famous for "Zombie" and the absolutely incompatible "The Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby." Well, add it to the unavailable <br /> <br /> list. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, relates to a necklace woman wearing a gold <br /> <br /> mask and a G-string. She wants the power of a young baptized <br /> <br /> stud that has a set of magical arrows and a bow. They are magic <br /> <br /> because they are glowing. Arrow joins a guy in a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and they spend most of the movie saving each other from flat <br /> <br /> action ranges. Eventually, the neck chick was defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before turning off the mask and reminding me why I inflated my <br /> <br /> girl. <br /> <br /> Fulci baths every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with <br /> <br /> smoking. Nothing like a smoky orange action series to make you <br /> <br /> looking for Sunny Delight and a cigarette. The special effects are <br /> <br /> ridiculous. In one order our ambiguous gay duo is <br /> <br /> attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously specks on <br /> <br /> the movie itself. The majority of the effect budget had to be <br /> <br /> on the Fulci-licious gore, which consist entirely of squirting <br/> <br /> wounds. Hey, we can all use a good spray wound once in a <br /> <br />, but if you get into the speed wound origin, it gets boring. <br /> <br /> I continued to play with <br /> <br /> The brightness setting on my TV, <br /> <br /> just to see how the slope happens. <br /> <br /> There are lots of talks about fulfilling omens and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> do a little look at the future ... if you get this movie and watch, <br /> <br /> you'll regret it. The scene on the video box (by Media) does not appear <br /> <br /> in any role in the movie. "Conquest" is a good <br /> <br /> work. What MST3K could do with it! <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gore, female <br /> <br /> nudity, short male nudity and light sexual content. <br /> <br />
