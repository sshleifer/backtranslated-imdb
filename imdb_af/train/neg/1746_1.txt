Probably the worst Bollywood movie I saw. <br /> <br /> No plot line. Very small character developments. <br /> <br /> Full of stupidity and senseless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and pointless. There was no proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> The same story is shuffled over and over until you say "please, continue with it !!" Even the song and dance were senseless and choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot fines around the world ... but then most Bollywood movies have it today. <br /> <br /> VAT I'm not from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
