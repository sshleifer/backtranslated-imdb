I got this movie as a gift, I got the DVD cover, this movie is going to be bad. After I hadn't watched it for more than a year, I finally looked at it. what is a pathetic movie ??. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't watch this bad movie, but writing a review would be unfair without watching the full movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie sucks." I'm really shocked that a bad movie maker woke up, even funded to make this pathetic movie. But it couldn't cost more than $ 20,000 to make this movie. All you need is a cheap camcorder or cell phone camera. About 15 people without acting, a script written by some drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter (Tara Woodley) is assuming to be drunk man to report on a hurried village. He is completely unscathed. They went to leave home, but fortunately it was almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the doorstep seems to be there. Just for the supposed to be drunk, but everything is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> Then the alleged drunk man Tara ghost / zombies starts telling stories. <br /> <br /> The fist of his stupid Lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> his story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper lets one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion (I think that's what happens). After the poor soldier left private Wilson, he dug him a grave and then collapsed the soldier, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> buried him in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper is in for a great surprise. his wife / girlfriend knows about this and she and her lover kill Sgt. Ben Draper to take revenge on private Wilson. (Along the tomb of the soldier he is killed). The soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of a zombie and kills them to take revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> The turning end was so lame. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, you shouldn't see this movie.
