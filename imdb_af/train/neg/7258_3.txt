This grainy film followed a cult and one of the mouth-to-mouth features you just had to see. Maybe it's hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southern Arkansas, Fouke, who knows the legend is true. This story is told in the documentary style told by Vern Stierman and filmed in the real places talk to real people involved. The legend changed with the story, but in the late 60's and most of the 70's, the surrounding area of ​​Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature traveling along Boggy Creek. With a long limit with three toes and standing over 7 feet high, this hirsute creature regularly caused damage and frightened the 'bejeebers' from most of the community. Personally, I crossed the small Boggy Creek Bridge in 1974, and yes, the hair on my neck rose. Of course it was about 1 hour in the rain. By the time I arrived in Shreveport, I laughed.
