After finding the first one, you think the Wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Although I don't think so. If the first one wasn't bad enough, this one is just as bad, it hurts to look. With all the actors they had in this movie, you think they can do something with a bit smarter. Although they could not, they all had to take the same, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow sit in the movie. Although the thing is, I didn't laugh at it for the first time. They tried to make these movies parody even though they failed on every level. Most of the time it's just randomly joking, which is so disgusting and noisy that it's hard to see and enjoy it. When they tried to make plays that were movie parodies, they only ended with a 20 minute relaxation of the scene with perhaps one joke in the whole scene. Also for people who say it's not for the older and actual young audience, well, I fit in the age group it is funny to. While people say that different people have different ideas about what is funny or not, if you find it funny, you're probably not one of the more mature or intelligent people. It doesn't take as much skill to write the kind of script, but if you want a smarter and funnier movie, watch the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's actually done well and well and it doesn't have to use disgusting and racial jokes to make it funny too.
