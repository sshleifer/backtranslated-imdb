I saw this movie in my theater class. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. I opened it and was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the role play was interesting. I just never connected to this movie. The acting was great, the movie was interesting, but the storyline, or rather lacking it, was a problem. There was no central theme for the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it western? Kind, but no. I'm all for dots in movies, I recently saw "Brick" and loved it, but the place where this movie goes was just out there. It was so strange, and if I didn't have to put the whole movie, I'd have gone out. The writing was not terrible, but it was just around the place. By the time this movie ended, I was just terribly confused and wanted to finish it earlier. There was just something about this movie that didn't resonate, I understand more offbeat movies like "Fight Club" but I just didn't care about the characters.
