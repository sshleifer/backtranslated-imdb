I encourage my films to fill out topic gaps in world cinema. When I looked at the trailer for the "Water Lilies", I expected to keep this movie, because I thought I had stumbled upon something unique: a movie that lesbian love honestly portrays - sort of a female version of "Beautiful Thing. " <br /> <br /> The main characters are young French women 15 years old. Marie is slim, reticent and beautiful in a tomboyish way; Floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always smothered in this movie, if not on the surface, then just below it. <br /> <br /> "Water lilies" are not about the uncovering of lesbian love on two teenagers; It's about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens who work at cross-targets and - in at least two cases - joyful, mechanical sex. It also proves that writers and filmmakers mark their own creations when they become manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the extra features on the DVD of the Lord of the Fly, director Peter Brook says: "French cynicism begins with the excitement of sex," which the French regard as children as angels, while their adolescents and adults with pervasive cynicism. Part of the downfall of this film is film producer Celine Sciamma experienced a mighty dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where's the joy?" I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, the first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-satisfying way. These positive aspects are missing from this movie; There is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this movie wants to be a pleasant celebration of the first love. But Sciamma is impressed with her own cynicism and cunning and destroys the film. First, what is the point of just showing the naked girl? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teenage nudity in the European film, as evidenced by films such as The Slingshot, The Rascals, The Devil, Probably The Little Thief, The Heart Of The Heart, Friends, Beau Pere and Europe, Europe " but this case is a small authoritative burglary: "See, I can make a movie where I just show the unattractive person naked." No nakedness or evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to go. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie dance, what follows is not just Floriane who manipulates Marie significantly; This is the movie maker Sciamma who synthesizes her audience synthetically. /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty occurs when Floriane warns Marie, she is going to ask something that is not normal Marie asks understandably, "Who cares to be normal?" Then Sciamma plays fake with her hearing and the quick momentum of the movie Floriane's request is a false, derivative and replacement question - not the authentic, sincere question that the film, Marie's character and the viewers who invested their time deserve. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that are fake on the viewer's nerves: 1) Since when did the French - from all the people - bathe bathing suits and with a turtle to boot? 2) Which teenager - of any nationality - will be put on an apple core thrown in the garbage to get a taste of the beloved's mouth? <br /> <br /> The three major actresses are promising, and if they find better vehicles for their talents, excellent actors can become. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and can have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) can become a leading lady, or a bombing, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has an intensity and magnetism that is unmistakable. In the future, she can play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysterious sensual seducer for a reluctant politician who adds a meteoric increase in praise. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Water Lilies" were very disappointing. Will an honest movie maker please make an authentic movie about two young women who fall in love! No - not necessarily for the sake of the middle-aged guy - but such young lesbian girls can have something of quality that they can see and identify. And yes, to fill a subject matter in world cinema.
