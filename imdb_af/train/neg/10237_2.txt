The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a surviving survivor, part of Mengele's twin experiments, mainly from her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of twin experiments. Of course the movie had good reviews. This is one of those topics that no one dares to talk about. <br /> <br /> I also sucked a great deal of the movie into the emotion that the film so obviously wanted the viewer to focus on. One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (of course nothing critical to say about the issue at a public forum) can only find the nicest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews with Kor argued in a Jewish center, the meaning of the word" forgiven "is even debated, but the isolated and vast Kor holds its own" But by this time the juicy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire lost enough that I could see again clearly. After the "strong will" Eva Kor has forgiven her "Nazi captors," the movie begins in what is forgiveness, at least from the point of view of Cor. The movie is about her, beyond her public statement forgiven by the Nazis and new territory. For me it was the meat of the film, surrounded by inedible fat from her "act of forgiveness". It was clear that it was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test her forgiveness theory, to heal past wounds, she makes her way to the "Promised Land" to meet some Arabs to talk to them about the issues that they face and to see if the dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and that it is strongly interrelated with debates and talks with Jews in the USA about her act of forgiveness of the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago. From then on, someone who is not so rude, that they cannot see the screen, can find it difficult to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements. <br /> <br /> First, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and reluctant to listen in a room full of Arabic scholars and teachers. Her comments on how she feared they could kidnap her show how much time, effort, and money the whole act was. A little annoyed dr. Sami Advan (professor of education at Bethlehem University) just gets it right when he tells Kor a statement she makes about how to sleep in her flat. <br /> <br /> Finally, debating at the Jewish Center in Chicago, where she is "grilled" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those who continue to suffer from the trauma of the deeds. <br /> <br /> I'll cut to the chase. By the end of the movie I was hoping I didn't choose to watch the movie. The film is bad because it was not deeper into something about Auschwitz, except the pure trivial, just enough to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewer memory and a barrier to tears. It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary, could not participate in a fair discussion. Her discussion ability was limited to her attitude on forgiveness (at best) to a complete reluctance to listen or participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, everyone is so delayed today that they cannot see the difference between making peace and forgiving? Another IMDb user is requested: "I don't see her forgiveness as bad. On the contrary, she wanted to lighten her grip from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go. "That would be the perfect layman's definition of PEACE. <br /> <br /> I think in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question people who have gone through more than man. mind can result. "<br /> <br /> PS The dictionary should definitely go into all the books-to-buy lists that keep everyone up.
