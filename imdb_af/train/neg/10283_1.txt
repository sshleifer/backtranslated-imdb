I hate to sound like an 'old man', but frankly, I didn't see too many movies that I liked after 1960. Generally speaking, it looks as if movies are getting worse and worse (although I enjoy the Scott Baio rather than the "The Bread, My Sweet" vehicle, except for the "the rich" sex scene that didn't add any value to the movie. film lets the mother, a former Las Vegas choir girl, not be able to survive on her own, although she is clearly in her 50's (although in her 40's) I did not buy it. 57 and love all the women I know in their 50's and 40's, more than I can survive myself. (As I did since graduating from high school on 13, I legally emancipated and sat down on my own life travel.) <br /> <br /> The girl is not credible in her job role, she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve (a good opportunity) and also drops the ball, but as another female employee arrives on the board and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her as an "opportunist" when she does just what any professional person would do - take advantage of a wide open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her colleague, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of honoring her promises (to her boss, in this case). <br /> <br /> The girl allows her to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but treats her mother (the woman who gave her life and raised her to "maturity") like a pariah . Apparently, the authors of a threesome do not understand that it is "the general thing" for PARENTS to act like children and then be treated as children of their children. It's just more of the common "baloney" that Hollywood is still trying to force our throat as if we, their public, were stupid to entertain through their creative offerings. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie with a stupid end. If the young male restaurateur was real and not a two-dimensional 'TV character', he would have stayed with the MOT, which wasn't as much older than he was and was very attractive. But in the end he falls to the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that youthfulness, but in a plain, dull way. (The 'opportunistic' young woman who worked with this girl was physically much more attractive.) <br /> <br /> No credible reason was given to the audience why the restaurateur preferred the daughter (what a sincere, selfish, self-centered b * tch who treated her mother with incredible contempt) to the mother - a kind-hearted woman, sweet-hearted, humorous, and a jie de vivre who couldn't even understand the daughter. Of course, the mother had her own defects. She responded to her husband's downfall by drinking her a year or two afterwards. It probably created the gulf between her and her scurrying daughter. <br /> <br /> No matter how the characters were or were not developed, it is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable show time, unless you really like baloney. (Where is that mustard?)
