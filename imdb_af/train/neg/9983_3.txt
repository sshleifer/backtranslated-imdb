This movie is a massive Yawn that proves that Americans don't have the fate of farce. Even when it's already written for them! The original movie "Hodet Over Water" is a fiery comedy of errors I would rate 8/10. It's not just about a linguistic translation, but some absurd chains of events are completely skipped, robbing the film of its original clever, obscure nature, and this in a cheap "oops there goes my pants" style of the farce.
