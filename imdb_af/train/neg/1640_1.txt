This movie stayed ... everything: story, acting, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes in, I stared at the screen and said, "How can all these guys get together and consider their friends (even without the girl)?" Another quarter of an hour, I pray for as much Amanda Peet as possible. When a bad movie is silent, it is ugly head, eye candy is a good comfort. But there wasn't much of it! Cheating on all fronts!
