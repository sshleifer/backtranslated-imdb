I know, I know, "Plan 9 of outer space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Manos, the hands of fate." But I can't work on that sock-monkey movie. From * course * they are bad. How can they be good? But if you're talking about movies with respectable production values ​​and bankable talent, the T. rex of all turkeys should be "Yentl". All the treacly phoniness, all self-absorbed infinity, which has made everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reached its peak in this movie. From his lonely top of fear, "Yentl" looks back to "A Star is Born" and forward to "The Mirror Has Two Faces." There is nothing else like that. What emotional oppression Streisand has pulled out to make this movie I would rather not speculate, and which audience she played so that I can't imagine, although I bet there is a nine in ten chance of you not do not participate. /> <br /> Nobel laureate and holy guardian of the Yiddish literature, Isaac Bashevis Singer, was so furious about what Streisand did to his story that he made her public. It is a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only committed suicide, but also made more horrible films.
