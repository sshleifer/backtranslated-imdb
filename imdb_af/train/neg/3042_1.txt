I may write 1000 words on this movie, but one word suffices: bizarre. Sir and I didn't laugh as much as I watched on this really horrible movie. We looked at each other with our best "What the ...?" expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes were funny, but it's just sick. What kind of thoughts do images produce like this and then put them on film for others to watch? What kind of thoughts do innocent children include in this strange, strange movie and then pack it as if it is suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, shouldn't see him / her this movie. Preteens can see it - probably with "What the ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to bring this movie to others, you might want to spit their eggshell. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever made.
