I'm a big fan of karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after seeing Fiza, which was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad, and there are movies that are cr * p. but this movie just takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> We were so bad we were bothered to pay our money for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, don't even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
