You must admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm in filmmaking. From 1985 to 2000 he made 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to do, it's probably all the crap (and a quick glance at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my embezzlement.) Part 3 sees a group of offensive students being detained, is a bit more advanced than usual after being attacked by hordes of the living dead, escaping from a top secret army base located right under their school. Director Sheets, based on a terrific script by Brian Eklund, is working on a horrible script. Sheets is another frightening amateur, with some ingenious terrible performances of his talent-free cast, horrific visual effects. and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard spacecraft and its trademarked creepy gore (handful of trash pulled from underneath its victims' clothes). Finally, what looks like an eternity that is annoyingly looks like characters running for their lives and unappealing walking people who are dear, Zombie Armageddon has finished a time series / paradox-twist end that allows viewers to see a few more will see turbulent minutes from the start of the movie. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets? What did we do to earn it again?
