When Rome is a definite improvement on it. To get there, I found myself too predictable, confronted and slow, and to this day I still see it as the Olsen twin's worst. But while Rome is not a horrible movie, it's not a great thing either. If I had to sum it up in one word, I would say that it is acceptable. It's fun for teenagers, but I think adults don't find much to continue. <br /> <br /> When In Rome does have its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually very decent actresses, certainly also very nice. I will admit when I was 10, I really loved them, and generally I still look like them. And I enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minutes. Back on the target, both girls do not work so badly, in fact, they are very attractive. Plus their outfits are to die, and the beauty of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is also not half bad. <br /> <br /> But where the movie is being brought down, it's in the plot and the writing. The writing is mostly clicked and has tips from deja vu. The plot, like most of the Mary Kate and Ashley movies, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any of the Olsen twins' work will find some of its original elements. Most characters are cardboard thin, and you don't learn many of them, and sometimes the tempo is uneven. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery is spoiled by a dull camera work. It always rushed. <br /> <br /> All in all, she has good points, and certainly viewable. For my taste, however, it is harmless and predictable teenage flu. 4/10 Bethany Cox
