An actor's first film is usually something that one can afford to miss. It's often the first job where the lack of movie experience is really being displayed by everyone involved. This movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that, even in 1982 standards are so bad, it's hysterically funny. On a clear little budget, filmed entirely in the Chicago area, most of the plays of the entire role-player are stiff, timber and cartoon. It is a cross between a high school game and a bad community theater. Noise from nearby traffic often drowns the dialogue, and dialogue is really bad, very explanatory in a way that is forced as compulsory and advisable rather than natural and organic. Scenes are confronted and limp, and although the characters move over a period of years, children or adults do not get older. <br /> <br /> I believe it is possible to make a Christian film that belongs to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on "The Message" or in this case , their own autobiographical ties with the project that set good film production values ​​apart. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor.) <br /> <br /> Luckily, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and credible - to watch in his subsequent films. Careers like she are definitely not on movies like this building.
