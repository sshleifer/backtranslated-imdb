I'm always amazed at how different all people are and how almost every movie gets you both. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata won't be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's there. First of all the sound. The producers spend more time on the soundtrack than editing. It was as loud as the soundtrack played and no one was talking and when Patrica spoke in her monotonous voice, she could almost be heard. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica basically had 3 emotions. Quiet, in great pain, or really angry, she has stigmata. The first was the dominant one, the second was screaming pain, the third was to increase her voice. It was hardness that disturbed the three and not emotion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the horrible filming and MTV like style. If you watch a 3-minute video, you need quick cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2-hour movie, it's nauseous. I don't see the meaning of her to see that women are all over the sky and drop a child. And no Pittsburg rains it so often! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story, with something that can be said, but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and rent the gorgous apartment that's me. Arquett lived in what ended up with the man shooting the story.
