This, the Tremors Series direct-to-video steal, contains sixty inspired seconds (saw blade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedium and stuff than you can shake a stick. Of course, Tremors 4 was shot at a crippling low budget. That means they only had enough special effects for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, tops. The intrepid, click-casting cast and chopped writing ensures that the remaining hours and a half of the Tremors 4 experience feel at least fifteen thousand years. Only hardcore Tremors fans will be able to go through, much less enjoy this movie. If you're not among them, don't bother.
