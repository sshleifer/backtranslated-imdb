I give this movie it is props that made it very good and performed fairly well. BUt I couldn't get past the impeccability of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> First, a game built around the idea of ​​"Russian Roulette" that has to fill in hours. The big problem is that if you do a "live" show, you have the possibility that your first competitor is the one who is unlucky enough to draw the "real" bullet. What are you doing then? You have 50 minutes of play to fill and nothing to show. The result is that Okay, you come to the end and the first five participants survive, which means number six has the bullet and may not be able to get the payout. He won't shoot himself at that stage, so it's kind of anti-climate. <br /> <br /> Second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People are going to be flashing, panicking, their underwear ground and doing things that won't otherwise make very good television. Too much arbitrariness. That's why the "real" Reality television has actually been carefully written and even edited. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is the "performance artist" ranting on female offerings, which was hardly ever historically predictable, as she went through without shooting. <br /> <br /> We is led to believe that performance ratings will increase while at 1am in the morning (unlikely) with the token Asian girl announcing every boost in ratings. <br /> <br /> a point about race and Big Surprisingly, the movies surprise two minorities (one gay) and two female participants are the ones who survive, so we are with the two white men, and of course, the slightly less pleasant ones are the ones who buy it. such a show is that it is random, but the guy who is the least is the man who dies. <br /> <br /> The Climax is that after two hours committed suicide, the Eva Mendes character (Mendes produced and died in this thing, so she has no one but to blame, but actually a conscience grows to somebody dies. What did she think would happen? She was quickly shot by a bystander over the whole thing (motives never explained) and the show became a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> The problem with media satire is that it must also be in reality, or it must be over the top to be ridiculous (like Network). Nor is it.
