Compared to American Graffiti is inevitable, so save your money and time by renting the timeless classic. Speaking of timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed to find the most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie from some of the songs and some of the clothes were wrong. There was crap like "they placed paradise to put up a parking lot." The filmmakers were hoping to raise a few smiles from us, but basically made me sound. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially healthy for teens. Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forty when they wrote the darn movie. Very little of what the characters said was credible. Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just failed. Although, there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams raised things like the future flower child and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. It shows a breaking character that will fully boil in its ultimate appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
