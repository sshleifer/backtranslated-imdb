I don't think a movie of Van Damme's will ever hit universal soldier, but you never know. This movie was good, but not as good as 1st. VD returns a Luc and has to fight again. He's trying 2 b jokes here, but it might be worth a visit. VD this time has a child of Ally W. Well, it showed a picture of them. 2. Goldberg was cool, he did his famous move-forget that she called because I didn't suck. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. It was the end like the 1st but not so good. VD moves his best in his career, as always - the HELICOPTER KICK. Even if the final end had to be longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it will never be the original top.
