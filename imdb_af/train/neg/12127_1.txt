Sorry Fulci fans, but I couldn't get through this one. The soundtrack was about as annoying as they were, the play was puerile, the story was done and done, and the direction didn't exist. <br /> <br /> Massacre honestly looked like a children's movie project. But I saw some of them, and they actually look better than that! They seem to have been so experienced they couldn't afford ... ANYONE! Not a DoP, not a director, no one who has even left, had an idea that acted. It was a very poor movie experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> It was about the worst goblet I saw, next to Terror Toons, which is the only one for outer space killer Klowns. I have nothing else to say about it. <br /> <br /> It counts 0.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
