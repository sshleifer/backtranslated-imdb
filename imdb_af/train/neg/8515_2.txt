I was so disappointed by this show. After hearing and reading the hoopla, how it was a "groundbreaking performance" and all kinds of wild promises like quality, I tried to see it. <br /> <br /> What a reduction !! The acting was very forced and exaggerated. The story made very little sense. As for a hint of the esteemed "look at teenagers' lives", I could just see a spicy effort that had so much reality for it as a reality program. <br /> <br /> Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason for this is that it is not so good to beat the drums over quality on this show, but to pay attention to how poor it is.
