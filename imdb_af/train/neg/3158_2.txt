It was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks terribly terribly through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The cover of the DVD doesn't even come close to what the movie actually is. Really, very boring. I had to move forward a few because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how on earth anyone can think it is good? Hhaha literally just like talking and saying "yes" and there is no passion whatsoever. I couldn't tell they were in love. I'm sorry, but it was the sad excuse for a movie I think I've ever seen.
