I couldn't go through the whole movie. Do such families say somewhere? There are many comments that this family describes as similar to LLBean models, and so I think it's a good description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> More absurdly amazing writing takes place when we meet a character referring to High School as "pigface" which has naturally grown into a lethal, wonderful 20-year-old Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but do well in the world - not for the money) and his beds Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I stop watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your unbelief for two hours, you might enjoy this sentimental, self-paced waste of time.
