Jungle Fever is too high styled, stereotyped, and comes across as essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong for the head and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although there is enough talent in this movie, it is mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Also, instead of simply racism for the ugly and stupid thing, it is, Spike Lee chooses to move it like a flag in a very winding and annoying way. I made it most of the movie, but I couldn't do it, and it seldom happens to me.
