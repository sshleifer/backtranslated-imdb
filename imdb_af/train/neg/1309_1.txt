This movie was extremely boring. It should be at least 15 minutes. The images of child and animal killed were a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> Usually I don't write comments, but this one was so bad with so much good and excellent comment. I think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title. <br /> <br /> What more can I say? I fall asleep 3 times in this movie. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from 8 hours sleep. I think this is the point itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep, don't try to rewind and catch up as you fall asleep again.
