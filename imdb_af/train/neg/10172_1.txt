When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit, I was eager to see the movie. And I have to say, the first fifteen minutes or so was nostalgic in a way. Then it went completely hill. I didn't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo. They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story. I was appalled that Noah was involved in anything of the kind, especially his role. No one with a fully functional brain would actually accept that crap over the Vietnam War. If someone really wants to know how communism was, read a book about it. And not one that is pricey or through it, just the cold hard facts. <br /> <br /> I just watched some scenes here because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interests me. . Everything else about this movie irritated me.
