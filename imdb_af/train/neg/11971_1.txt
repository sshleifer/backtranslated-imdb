Although a movie with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you better save this one. I watched this one on television, so I didn't need cash for that. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so is reasonably credible, it becomes more and more incredible at the end. It is highly questionable, as a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters direct commands would obey. And even if he wanted to, than the rest of his platoon would. They know that he puts them at risk, and they know they will surely die if they follow him, but what is hell, he is our Lt. Let's do what he says (remembering the direct commands). <br /> <br /> However, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They save a village, where the total population is murdered by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers or so, the rest are already dead. The strange part of it was that they took the trucks left by the rebels. Rather, they go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for that. Anyway. I think that was what made the movie the one point I gave it. <br /> <br /> What made this movie an insult to the brain and therefore totally unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being injured or killed. Only near the end do they lose some comrades. And that's just because they have to fight an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fight from an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and lose just a few of themselves. And they have laps and ammunition. Never run out. Grenades and Claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get these things? Carry it around or what? They even have a laptop that shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that goes on for days. Really? Who thinks this crap. <br /> <br /> If you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a lot of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.
