Absolute garbage, worse combat scenes than a 20-year-old dam dam or American ninja. <br /> <br /> Really scary, not a skill in sight throughout the movie is like a cast of wooden images. /> <br /> Just look at how really bad this movie is. It might have been acceptable in the 80's, but it's a 2006 movie. I don't have much love for this movie, because it wasn't born in the book. 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real fight movies, watch tony yawns in the box and the protector, these are proper martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Keep a laugh and watch it today. You can see the unintentional humor how scary it is.
