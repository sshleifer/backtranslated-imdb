One of the worst movies I've seen is a camel camera work, a crappy filter used, the movie is gritty, the writing was terrible, I mean, how predictable was the big battle in the end. . <br /> <br /> Some of the fighting scenes were okay I think .... <br /> <br /> Some scenes were so bad, it was comical ... like Sorbo riding the horse and at the end ... LOL, I mean really .. a horse? Oh, can't forget how the bad killers in the same vehicle roll through the whole movie. One would think they would have to be traced to the killing of key witnesses and federal agents. ENC, ETC, actually, does not bother. .
