Bashki must be congratulated for trying to turn one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then slapped for this effort. The animation was poor, the characters became ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the movie was a ramshackle blitz by the first book and a half by Tolkien's masterpiece. I can still remember my great disappointment and dislike for the movie when I first saw it. Now, I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie fails in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is just pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
