I don't know where to start. The film is full of people who have never done anything before. Debralee Scott is listed on cover box, but does not appear in the movie at all. The writing is pretty bad, even for college movies. It is, of course, very low budget, with one scene at the master's house with extremely cunning editing. <br /> <br /> The characters are pretty typical for college movies - sly old, nerd, suave black man, tough guys, man with mustache. , attractive girl, little village girl, etc. The foremost teacher is about what you would expect ... middle-aged, hard-hit guy who easily touches the pavement. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a college Flick, stay away from this one. It's so bad, it's not funny.
