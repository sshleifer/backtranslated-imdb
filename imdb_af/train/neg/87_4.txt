I have read all the Love Bowl soft books. Please note that movies may not use all aspects of the book, but generally have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. The only thing they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's dad comes to visit (although both parents come in the book). This is all. The story line was so distorted and hurried and yes, sad, out of the book, I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book, it was too sad. I know Pioneer's life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is to have the same family orientation of the movie that makes them big.
