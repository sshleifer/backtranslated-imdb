Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in California, so we could have had scenes in the desert. It would have been more true in the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with many pine trees where it looks cold. It doesn't feel much Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they are running to fight aliens in a Canadian forest. And it's so nice, on other planets, the fall is also good. You can see leaves on the ground in the bushes that all look like bushes outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He's not Kurt Russel. Certainly, he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russel's performance a bit, but he's just not as cool as Russel. And not as good as an actor like Russel. And Russell's way of playing O Neill, he was much more cynical. Otherwise, O Neil, is too much too soft. I liked that Russell's version just didn't give a *** and had no trouble blasting the bomb to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a very good job, however, as Jackson takes over from James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a very annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former pathetic Ra character guard, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c talks and acts like a robot. I saw better because of Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie can suddenly speak English is also incredible. dumb. What made the strangers so much in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were true monsters. <br /> <br /> As far as special effects are concerned, they're really good at the pilot. But the very rare effects in the real show are badly done and look cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they are walking around on a soundtrack with a poor paint in the background. It is an insult to our viewers that they make it look so cheap. Especially when they could make it before a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The X files had better effects when they broadcast their first episodes in 1993. It was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they didn't have the apparent budget of two million dollars per episode, which SG-1 had suspected. They have to spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and useless performance, which could have been good if they shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
