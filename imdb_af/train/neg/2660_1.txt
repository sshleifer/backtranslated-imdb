The subject, in spite of that, is an amateur, expressionist movie - or an attempt in one - that is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of doom "poetry". To be sure, it will disturb viewers who are disturbed by disturbance, but success will be attributed to themselves, not to the director. To really come under someone's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as an eye and ear. The film contains a moody image, which is used as a silence (and also on the video case), but with no development leading or escaping. If the director had an eye on it, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - it's a movie.
