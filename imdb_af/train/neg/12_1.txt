All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade demolition. Many have talked about its quality, how is this film such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral in a standalone state of unfortunate events. However, the techniques used (as already mentioned) are over-exploited and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it was unclear, unattractive, indefensible and twisted. You can read most other reports on this movie and they will pretty much say the same as I would. <br /> <br /> Allowed some of the actors and actresses are attractive, but when faced with such boring action ... it just seems to be a movie so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gun at the end. Nothing really to write about the house. <br /> <br /> Like others said, "BAD" movies are great to watch for the reason they are bad. However, this film is a void. This is nothing. <br /> <br /> Also, if one really needs an educational movie to keep people away from drug use, then I would seriously recommend that there be a number of other movies out there that have such problems in a lot of more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Although there are also some more light films on the same subject such as 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked' should be watched. <br /> <br /> On a final note, the one that may be a redeeming line in This movie, produced by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that big movie is contaminated by 'Loaded' is dirty. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly suggest that you save money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.
