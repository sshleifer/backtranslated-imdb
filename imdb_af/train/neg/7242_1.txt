The Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that only partially does not work with the pouring of Gwyneth Paltrow (July). Gwyneth Paltrow walks through the entire movie with a confused look on her face and it's hard to tell what David Schwimmer even sees in her. <br /> <br /> But the Pallbearer is sometimes funny, especially the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh, but that's basically it. Watch the Pallbearer for the screens and the rest fast forward. Trust me not to miss much.
