This movie seems to have been made by someone with some good ideas, but who has never made a movie, or thought that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and mistakenly believe it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot on mind control and so many flat, unpredictable moments. And to fix that, Candy delivered some of the cruel lines I've ever heard. So, despite a potentially funny movie and story idea, we're left with an amateur and rugged movie that is likely to be stupid for the average adult, although teens will probably find some laughs. It's really a shame - it could have been so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it should have been wonderful.
