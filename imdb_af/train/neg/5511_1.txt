I have to agree with the very first remark: this movie sucks very, very hard. Despite a huge B list, the cover of this movie (for those who don't watch it on Comedy Central, on a weekday is probably the only exposure this movie will ever get). In fact, it's just a salary for every 80's comedy comedy. Randy Quaid? Cheque. Ed Begley, Jr. Cheque. The voice of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only horrible movie: double check. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this movie is that it is so lazy written with already mentioned jokes. Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. It is better to dry paint. It's definitely live-to-video-scraping-the-under-the-kegs that still believe in the old video adage: throw an old star on the front page and you'll get some money back from the rent. . Considering the days of video rental change, consider this one of the last examples to run garbage. <br /> <br /> The only use this movie has if you struggle to fall asleep. It'll get you there.
