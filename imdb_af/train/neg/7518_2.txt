Horror movies can be fun with low budgets, bad acting, and a bit of panache. I think the movie just becomes panache, because the one deadly dull scene after another makes people untrue innocent claw handles in the air. If it wasn't so boring, it might be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can pass with a tired concept like "college kids in a haunted house," in the same way as the Evil Dead movies have had fun with a similar standard plot. Hallow's End, unfortunately, doesn't go a long way. Actually, it's not going anywhere. It spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters that look like endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development, not even in a horror movie, but it's strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha male, the milquetoast, the ... um ... throw away characters that mostly exist for sex scenes.) Spending forty plus bloodless, droning minutes with them was more terrible than when bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, implied bloodshed anyway. When the college kids change to what they dressed as for their haunted house (one is a vampire, one wears O.R. scrubs and a white pancake), they look as good as in their amateur haunted costumes; The Dead Hate The Living, with a similar theme, is a masterpiece in comparison. There is really no way to talk about it, nor is it really scary. <br /> <br /> I thought of this one of almost every approach. If it were supposed to be a tough, exciting horror movie (which would explain why things are moving so slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and cheap samples would invalidate it. If it was supposed to be a real blood and guts horror movie (which would explain the shock) ... where is the blood and gut? And the anticlimax is one of the inconspicuous ends to a movie I've ever seen. This is the kind of movie that, although not a narrator by the film, is surrendered by books because all the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> It was a hard one ... from there I wonder if I just sat by a Christian horror movie. Maybe the "I know hell exists" of the opening is not so meant, but there are some tips (or misdirection - I don't know what). For all the curse in the movie, a line like 'gosh-darnit' comes from a bit absurd, so worshiping most crucifixes, godly and satan-dreading, especially after some lecherous T&A sexes (one heterosexual , a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian company (Highland Myst's logo even has a bit of crucifixion), this role weighs heavily on the atheist camp. An almighty being cannot be such a filmmaker. <br /> <br />
