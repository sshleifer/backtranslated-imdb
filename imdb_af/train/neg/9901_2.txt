It had to have been a one star, but there were so many clich√©s, predictable twists, all seen before the author movie parallels that I actually give it an extra star for the fact that it made me laugh ... though It never is the director's intention. <br /> <br /> I don't often write comments about movies, they must be sensational, or in this case, very bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it, I knew it was going to be poor because he had a unique nose to take out the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the farce of it all made me see all the way through, possibly for the hilarious voice of MR T (don't reload Mr. T, but you'll know what I mean If you bother it.) If you look at it, make sure you don't pay to see it. . It may have been if they put real comedy in it, but I'm sure you'll find the strange laugh here and there at the side of it all ...
