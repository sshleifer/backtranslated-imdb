Nothing to say, but Wow! Did anyone actually sleep on them on an open field? Well, it happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly the directors' favorite scare tactics). In one of the opening styles, the smooth talk / hot shot producer should drive in the back seat so that the camera can sit in front of the film. Shortly after arriving at the field, the 5 participants appear and although it is clear the last two in the afternoon, they are all convinced that the sun will take place any moment. After about 30 minutes of unashamed trash, we are fortunate to have a backlash from the clown's history in which we see his previous victims. Watching this movie looks at the ladies' coffin. Her ribs went completely to her neck, it was flattened. Most horror movies take place during the night, but without a night vision camera, the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots made in the film seem to have been stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the director's backyard. The movie finally delivered itself when there was a matrix that looked like the shoulder that swung us back and watched him laugh hysterically. <br /> <br /> Definitely THIS MOVIE RENTS YOU WILL ALSO BE CLOSED. ON PUBLIC AREA. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, THE ANSWER
