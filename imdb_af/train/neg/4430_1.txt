Thanks to a dull, dimensionless script by Neil Simon, and a lack of direction by Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a shrewd showcase for Marsha Mason who received her third of four Oscar buttons for Chapter Two, which has the same performance in her Cinnderella gave Liberty. 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), just this time she doesn't have a child to drag around. Chapter Two is the third and final feature film for Moore who previously directed Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder By Death (76). Caan is overlooked, the characters are monodimensional, the dialogue is too analytical, and there is virtually no increasing detail. The first half is less than fascinating, meets cute, concise romance between a shiny Caan and a Mason tipper, and the brave second half makes you long in the first half. The NYC locations as well as Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper, are irrelevant, but at least they offer a welcome distraction. And the last and least, there was a terrible song played during the credits.
