This is a film that tries to give back Thai history to the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in the line of many Thai movies I watched and enjoyed, one that Thai actors speak Thai and martial arts madness. Well, that's nothing of it. This film was shot entirely in English, is full of Anglo actors and has production values ​​so horrible, it is laughably bad .... but not funny! Who can blame us for this garbage? The acting dialogue, and most of the sets were very bad. Some of the battle scenes seemed to be choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap screen animation animations, which had a particularly chaotic effect. It has a great, extraordinary battle scene, where a few thousand extras can run over a field in costume, but if we see the two armies clash in battle - HA! What a joke! The film contains some beauty. What a pity they didn't show a little more skin. That would have been at least something for the guys to appreciate. Don't bother.
