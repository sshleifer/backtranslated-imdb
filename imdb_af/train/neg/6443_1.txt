I was one of the few non-liberals to see Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... in the film entertainment and boredom of propaganda. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the movie might be a real documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it seems to be another liberal, slash-and-burn attempt to relax conservatives and the local religious community. It seems to be a filmmaker doing self-service to make a documentary that only reflects his issues on issues. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising is seeing all the 10 voices posted by his family. Did they even watch the video? Golly gives Batman, this must rank with All The President's Men! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, like stacking the votes at IMDb, it will help a lame movie. Maybe my voice will help balance it.
