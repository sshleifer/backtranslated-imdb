I understand what this movie is trying to portray. How the guy is often ignored and treated like a bit, which means they feel untouched and their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I don't have a problem with this message, but I just feel it could be overhauled in a way that isn't so painful to watch. I enjoy a good art film, but if a movie becomes too self-conscious (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Including shots of a person who slows down taking 5 minutes, trying to make a point, but just ends up hearing. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very poor and you just end up telling them pull it together. It's a movie you feel you should enjoy or highly rated and definitely has its earnings, but I was just too frustrated to see if it was ever recommended to anyone else. It may have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies (for example, "Notting Hill"), but it was at least a movie to enjoy watching.
