I don't understand why remake has become the trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible, and that's no exception. If someone from Ben Jones saw the quote, it's a "messy" trash, he's right. Why they never missed an amazing television program, which I loved, would have had an episode and had their own seasons 1-4 on DVD and would ruin it, I will never know. The television program was a family program, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted or even addressed in the show, except the outfits. A family show was put in a dirty piece, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also very cute. The new Bo and Lukas are not even cute. It was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. At least they could have gotten a daisy for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is also a qualified Boss Hogg. Every other role he ever played is totally against this role. The only role they justify halfway is Willie Nelson as uncle Jesse, but it's still no comparison. Denver Pyle is already his own actor, and it made him perfect for the role. I think the game is terrible, the story is terrible and has ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, horrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to see it. I just saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. Don't pay to watch this movie.
