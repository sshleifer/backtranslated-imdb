I remembered this show when I was a kid. I couldn't remember too much, just a few little things about the characters. For some reason I remember it being very intense. Also this was really really early in the morning in PA. I finally found an episode after watching the web for a long time. the first episode no less. Criminey! This show was so terrible. Of course, it's just made to show kids what lazer tag is playing and having a good time. the show starts with bhodi li tells his mother "my names not christopher, i am bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" we are then obliged to see children playing lazer-tag for the song "foot loose". and not just a quick bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain just hurts to think about it. Oh, and as if I can't get worse, you can't see the laser beams from their guns. It's like they just run around to the whole "foot loose" song. Later, after Bhodi goes into space or where they ever have a Crappy Laser Gun battle after the Phil Collins song "su-su-sudio". Ah, trust me, you don't want to know the rest. what can i say ...... THE LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
