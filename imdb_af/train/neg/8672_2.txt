Most action films are harsh from the Hindi theater, especially from Sunny and his family. <br /> <br /> The movie is typical. Sunny type with bashes, large dialogues and melodramas. <br /> <br /> The movie also has typical Rajiv Rai ingredients from many henchmen and a strange villain <br /> <br /> The start is okay and then the move to Kenya is good, but then the movie on and off <br /> <br /> The sequence of events is moving at a slow pace and nothing big happens <br /> <br /> They are very stupid scenes like the Kenya policemen like wilds, especially Sharat, shown <br /> <br /> The climax is also extended <br /> <Rajiv Rai does a good job Music is ok, just one song works and this is the last TOOFAN camera work is good. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as usual, Chunky acts like a monkey while he is serious. Scenes are playable, Naser is good, heroines are pure wood. Amrish Puri is not even as scary as he was in TRIDEV. The rest is good.
