I knew this movie wouldn't be great, but I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought it had potential. Unfortunately, much of the film's dialogue was very fake and cheesy. I think Aquafresh gave money for the production of the movie because they dropped all the tips seriously. There is a shot where the Aquafresh sign comes to you, which you can't help but see. Perhaps they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times we can drop Aquafresh products into the movie without people being seriously annoyed. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I didn't spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
