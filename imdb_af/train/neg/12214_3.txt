Well, what I can say about this movie is that it is wonderful to see so many Asian faces. What I didn't like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do. The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to surprise, surprised the white man in Asian culture and decided to leave his white world behind for the yellow and the "proper" black taxi driver. Plus all the Coke, Shanghai Tang and Dunkin Donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. The story plot itself was fun, but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel. Then again when you look at romantic comedies, you can't expect much, but then I would just be surprised again. The parents are the best part of the movie.
