There aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough 'coming out' movies. Each one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the movie looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) REAL looks good in a few teams), it's a bad one. It's a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) a life that looks 40 years behind the west. In a way, we see our own history; that would have been possible for gays in the 40's and 50's here (it often reminded me of "Last Exit to Brooklyn: the book isn't the movie"). But it is incessantly depressed and SLOW in a confronted way sending an old SCTV up from Ingmar Bergman. It has been edited so untidily. I wonder if the director did not go randomly. Yes, it is a wonder that it was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, life behind the `curtain 'was difficult for gay people. A good director could have proven it all without disturbing the audience. A good director would have shown me to be one of the great upcoming movies and not one of the misses.
