It's a choice from the dialogue delivered by the evil female female assistant of a famous scientist to her prim virgin, before she attracts three incredible stupid college girls to a behavior modification experimental home. Meanwhile, drinking and dancing at the local pub 80 songs. A biker punk slaughtered a cyclist on a pinball table in front of a crowd and then raped the scientist's virgin daughter, Jessica (Debra Hunter), who fell in love with another cyclist (Dale Midkiff, of PET SEMATORY). , which in turn is in cohorts with the assistant! Back home, the girl, bimbos, swims, changes clothes and enjoys sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies in the mouth of the victims and turns them into the cold, killer zombies! <br /> <br /> If it's not enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic puppet (!?) who warns "DANGER! DANGER!" just like the RELEASE IN SPACE robot and recommends keeping up as one of the best ways to pick up men! <br /> <br /> This filmed-in-Florida mess is so indignant that various views are recommended to do so all week. And, isn't it that NYPD Blue's detective Jill Kirkendall CNN writer Andrea Thompson turned to one of the latest bimbos? Sure is! It was presumably started in 1982 and new material was later added to the video release in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (and that means it in a good way!)
