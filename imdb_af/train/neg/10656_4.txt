What can I say. A Kamal Hassan movie is horrible. He does very well, but it's a terrible story, along with a horrible direction. In my opinion, the director should instruct Gautham Menon. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. In addition, one just can't believe how true these terrible crimes were. There was no practical application in the movie. Gautham is just out of stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika are doing really well. The villains seem too ugly, although their performance was not bad. I don't think it's a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa you can see with the family. You won't get sleep to see this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a good job again and therefore I gave this movie 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is soulful and soothing. In addition, there is great cinematography. Overall, it's just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, had to reject this movie.
