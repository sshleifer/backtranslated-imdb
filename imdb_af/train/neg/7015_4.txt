"54" is a movie based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 1970s - the hangout for social elite and party clubs. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on a real Studio employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The movie's problem is that it's all shimmering and style and no dust. It tries to be a very bad and so-called satire like Boogie Nights, but eventually arrives as an inferior wannabe. Mike Myers has the ungrateful job of playing the owner of cocaine snoring club Steve Rubell. It's just a slight comic role and if it was Myers best efforts to move into drama like Lemmon and other comic actors in their time, it's a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" could have been informative and interesting, but it's just another dumb teenage movie that's not entertaining or even remote. Look at your own risk.
