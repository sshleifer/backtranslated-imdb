The question, when one sees a movie so badly, is not necessarily: "How did a movie make this bad?" or even, "Why did I see this terribly in the first place?" but, "What have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of horror movies have been cataloged and satirized over the past 10 years doesn't mean anyone will continue to make a movie don't use ALL of them, without a bit of humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie is to be unplugged ** based on the video game, you have scripting issues. <br /> <br /> - The black character will not always die, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you might be proud of the way you "budget" the "Matrix" effect, it doesn't necessarily mean you should abuse it over and over again. <br /> <br /> - To ensure Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee choice roles. <br /> <br /> - When a scene does not change together, use only some footage from the video game, no one will notice <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap-metal band can write your movie's theme for free, courteously drop it. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not a by-people They are about killing zombies, preferably in the most horrific way, making them SCARY. <br /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1,600 to earn a rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know, anything else you will find on your own two lines after someone asked, "What was it?" or, "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Bare breasts is not horror movie panacea. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter boom shot and a licensing agreement with Sega transforms your movie into a "student movie" movie after "big studio release". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name three live dead movies, you don't mind George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but just because I've seen Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.
