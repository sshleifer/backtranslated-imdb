This movie was terrible. I first read the plot summary and it looks good, so I watched it. The acting was terrible. It was as if the actor was almost ashamed of camera. everything looks fake. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago. I watched it at least 20 times. <br /> <br /> The plot was also a crap. the writers were probably deprived of sleep when they came with the lines. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much the worst can get, so you can tell others later how you couldn't believe how horrible the movie was. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should watch it, so we can appreciate other REAL movies.
