I saw this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to insult ... everyone!" said the trailer. Well, it offended me because this movie really sucks. It's almost a comedy, as I laughed in the whole movie in two seconds. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I have no problem with those who are, but what is the point of adding so many gay scenes to a so-called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I think the director is a gay man in denial or something. <br /> <br /> So my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, rent a good comedy you've already seen millions of times, you'll be better off than this Mother of All the Great Comedy to watch. It's actually total crap.
