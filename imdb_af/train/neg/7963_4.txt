I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and since I was middle-aged, I'm a movie made before 1970. Most are made in the 1920s to 1960s. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception to Creepshow 1, which I thought was wonderful. I can recall the stories there, but I really enjoyed the monster in the boxing story with Hal Holbrook, and the one about the really clean man was a good ending. However, all the stories were good. So why did I like so many of them? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, the horror was elevated with a proximity to a terrified face and the funny pieces were really funny! This successor is either missing many of these elements or they are completely absent! I just write this because I partially watched it because the movie was a total waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing movies on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get the best bill, tell you ..... 4 of 10. Also, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they had to tell him to write it down to a PG standard. I don't know what it's appreciated, but it seems to me PG, and it's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else. This is shown on the Encore cable channel if you die (yuck yuck) to see it.
