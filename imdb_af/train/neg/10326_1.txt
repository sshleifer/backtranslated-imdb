The Canadian TV is out again and creates another show that will be reversed after the premiere episode. <br /> <br /> The last time I remembered sitcoms was supposed to trigger a response we call in the business. How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people and think that all Muslims are terrorists? OK, maybe, one joke, just to keep it to the masses. But not 30 minutes. It is called a dead horse. Even SNL will know to give up after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> Let us also have some conflict in these scriptures. Will she or she not serve cucumber sandwiches to break fast on Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhh, this is Emmy's winning stuff here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! Which characters?! They are all cardboard cuttings, without anything interesting to let us follow from one situation to the next. This is the point of the situation comedy. We need strong, interesting, dynamic characters so we are constantly drawn to the TV series every week. We need to care about these characters to worry about what problems they will face next week. If I never see these characters, it will be too soon. Fortunately, I can't remember any of their names (note to CBC - it's not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so dirty. This is more of a problem in casting than in the actors. None of these people actually represent the characters they play. They just seem to be working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - let's fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character they portray. Look at any American sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. Part of the problem is that the actors look like this is a platform for bigger and better things, rather than being a great character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years. Shows the level of interest in the characters and the project. To be honest, considering the lame concept and the terrible writing, there is not much for the actors to do, but to say their lines and not to bump into furniture. Like another article, it looks like a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And directing or lacking it! What can I say, Canada has so much talent, look at what the Comedy Channel does with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Watch the Trailer Park Boys (not the movie because it's the big helium dog bitter). Look at any American show to see the potential of our talent, because that's where many of our stars are going to find decent work. <br /> <br /> Credit to the CBC, they really know how to build publicity for a non-event. Remember "The One"? No, do not first learn one of the characters' names in this display, as this is probably the path of the dodo. <br /> <br /> Let's hope for a full ACTRA strike so nothing like this comes from the Ceeb for a long time.
