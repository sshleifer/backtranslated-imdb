When I saw it at a store, I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek, Texas meets chain killings, and I think it costs only three quid (about $ 6). To be honest, I don't think it was even worth it. <br /> <br /> It looked like the directors - the "butcher's brothers" couldn't decide if they wanted to do an art or similar horror or a gory slasher. It ended up with a clich√©-ridden, sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters one-dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them, but trying to care the audience for the characters they eventually a useless monologue added. and the beginning of the perfectly honest movie was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good part was really the middle / end - I won't ruin it for you. But it was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> Overall a useless watch. It felt like a two-hour movie, but was just 75 minutes. If you want an art film, don't bother. If you want a slasher movie, don't bother. The film moves so slowly with nothing that ever happens.
