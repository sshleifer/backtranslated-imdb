I like to watch Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this poor excuse that a gentle porn movie is unnecessarily offensive has nothing on white, and only serves as a vehicle of self-promotion for Springer. Even though it does take a quick 90 minutes, the film carries crooks, and I had to have the common sense to walk out. Simply horrible.
