Where to start. The movie started well, but after the 30-minute point I caught myself watching the watch. The horror at the start of the film was good, but then the story kicked. It just became thinner and stupid than the time looked. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this movie, but I was a bit bored by Vinny Jones's constant scowling in the movie. <br /> <br /> As the movie dragged and caught my word for it, it dragged on. It just got more and more far-fetched. <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, after the crowd crowded when the skeleton looked up Just to eat the dead that didn't make sense at all. It was a kind of meat eating cult and the good guys died at the end. The end just made me laugh at how bad it was. As soon as Vinny Jones starred, he became the new killer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie makes Creep look like the best horror movie ever made. I gave it 1 star because the female head did a good job, but even she couldn't save this train wreck from a movie!
