When I think of the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" comes to movies, I am reminded of the last years "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> An underlined but completely realistic depiction of the small town. The title is the reason for consideration. Perhaps, we, the audience is the one in the "Bubble" as we do not get any runs in the film slim 90 minutes. Hearing reactions were often obnoxious and judgmental, which clearly indicates how detached people can be to see any thread of humanity in characters so strange to themselves. These characters are the ones people refer to as those who put George W. back in office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It is sober to consider how reality television spoiled our awareness of reality when we jumped to an audience. their feet for the exit as soon as the credits roll. This film has its merits and is worthy of consideration for the things it does not say straight.
