The only redeeming features of this movie are the fairly original deaths. Otherwise, this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the beleaguered housewife, slowing down the local mall for the first 30 minutes. of the movie, which didn't add anything. Then the movie takes a bit, because she has a confrontation with 4 punks that picked up 2 parking bays on this busy Christmas month. They began to pursue her after they set fire to the local security guard trying to help her. From there, this movie gets worse, much worse. I know she is just a movie and you have to go with the flow, but she has about 5 minutes. head start and she can't hide or find someone to help her. Instead, she drives to a half-built subdivision along a forest. She typically does everything she can to make her followers understand. But now she turns into a hard mofie. You get the point. Under no circumstances should you buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you like this type. It is so illogical that you question every scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as consumers.
