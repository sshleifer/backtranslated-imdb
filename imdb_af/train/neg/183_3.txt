It's an action West. James Steart leads an all star cast in the picturesque North West, filmed in great glory. The scenery and costumes are wonderful. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich cleman who is crooked in the east of Ndweste. <br /> <br /> The biggest drawback is the stereotypical sync that Hollywood has always made in a hero. Even when this film was made, the synika was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart imagery really has very little savings. He is friendly to his two partners, giving him an extra dimension of credibility and equality. <br /> <br /> However, he is so beautiful to everyone, it's hard to really care for him, or to accept him He is much like the one-dimensional spaghetti Western characters (don't cut that badly). <br /> <br /> Still, the little characters are pretty nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make it worth watching.
