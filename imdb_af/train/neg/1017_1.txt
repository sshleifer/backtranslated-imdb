Oh dear god. It was terrible. There is bad, then it was. This movie doesn't make sense at all. It runs completely over the map and is not clear about what she says. The music seemed to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not a real city is a must. Since living in Vancouver, this movie has seen and recognized all these places, making it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only writing that was decent was "Tilman" in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and was not at the top of the camp. It was actually a disgrace to see John Heard playing such a bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie is a blast. Sorry. Hopefully someone will see it more important, and at least give credit to John Heard where credit is owed, and hire him as a leader bad man again, that's where he should be. on the list.
