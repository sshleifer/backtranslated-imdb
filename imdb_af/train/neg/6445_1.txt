When evaluating documentary documents that focus a relatively small group of Ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the US, consider the following. The United States of America, with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold Human Rights, has its failures and disadvantage. Of course, extreme right-wing and ultra-conservative groups are expected to be in large numbers, but relative to their population size, they are very small and isolated. On a per capita basis, Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right-wing groups, actually per capita, the actual size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States. It is for the above reasons that it is unfair to despise and deceive the American people and their level of debate in American education by representing these ultra-right-wing many psychopaths as deceptive and misleading as representing the American Society. In doing so, Greenstreet has deliberately selected small and isolated groups on the opposite side of the spectrum to create an image of America that is a far-reaching and deliberate sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to quote and obscure the Americans and lifestyle in the hands of the fashionable and clich√© idealistic left ideology of people who hate this subconscious and morbid. This film was made for profit not to promote the truth about American society and human condition. Greenstreet can create documentaries that focus on ultra-right conspiracies, the Military Industrial Complex, but fail to offer an intelligent and balanced factual debate, and allow alternative solutions to the failures of a vibrant democracy. Movie Show is exposed as Anti American by its support for this trash. SENSATIONALISM at its worst anti-USA garbage scandal.
