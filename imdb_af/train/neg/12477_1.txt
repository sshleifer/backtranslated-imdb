It is one of those movies you and a lot of friends put to drink beer, eat pizza and laugh. Unfortunately I found myself watching this one alone. My friends and I hired a big block of movies and never came around to see this one. It was back and I thought it was a waste not to see it. So I did, and I was impressed by how absolutely horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Now, I like bad movies a lot, and I would probably have been this one if the "hero" wasn't. so horrible. The whole movie I hoped he would put that dumb sword down and kill someone! He does many little heroic things in the movie. He is a greasy, disgusting, stupid thing. He has less redeeming qualities than the villains do. And what was it with all the naked chicks? I mean, I like naked chicks just as much as the next guy, but this movie has a little overboard in that department. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can be a disgusting hero "then I'm sure you'll keep this shock from a movie.
