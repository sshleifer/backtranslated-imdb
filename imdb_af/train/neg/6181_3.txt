If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie can be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I didn't even know about this movie's existence until the day before its release, when the advertising-driven music series made panic and cover with dozens of kites and billboards. In any case, it was barely two weeks in theaters. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a movie. To start, the names are a bit much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's awkward slow delivery of lines makes you wonder what the production assistant has held, and keeps the cue cards off the camera. Angel's character quickly changes from her city-like ways to a cowgirl, slipping on the farm in the southern snake after two days. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's. In the final scene, their outfits are identical, and it is a wonder if the wardrobe assistant gets sick. <br /> <br /> The sound is contradictory - Perhaps the most notable example is when Toby decides to swim and his voice sounds like he is screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development to suffice on the screen. Persecution, surprise, grimace and state of mind describe the description of the actors and the direction of the terrible text. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after eating some alcoholic drinks and in the company of your whimsical friends. But it doesn't say much.
