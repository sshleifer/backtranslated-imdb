As the cover says, "The village of our time, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to various aspects of the play, including sexuality; a very very homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) it was a very good version of Hamlet, but can't be compared to Branagh's full version. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found the video at my local video store. Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if anything like that. If someone knows one, please tell me.
