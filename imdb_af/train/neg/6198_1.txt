This cowardly and offensive movie had my plot to start. The characters are the well-known, often-known, young males and are seen bored in a seaside village. Robert is an outsider, but he has his music that could be his soul. Instead, Clay Robert makes a freak that begins a journey to cannabis and ecstasy and enters the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert ends the film as a murderous rapist. One wonders how much real life experience this young director has. Nobody can save Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. A very unreliable link is made to the Iraqi rebels; during the unnecessary graphic rape we are exposed to explosions and images of war. The film shows the male peer group extremism pushed by it. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful portrayal of the modern man. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves to causing terrible acts of violence. It is a wonder that the British film industry is allowing money to be invested in films that advocate such divisions of propaganda, when we continue to participate in the recent attacks in London. It's Clay's first movie, I'll be happy if it's his last.
