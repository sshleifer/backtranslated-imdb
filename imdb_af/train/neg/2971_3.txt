Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, in a word, is birthday. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mysterious female vigilante ("Batwoman") enters Batman's turf, and while Batman is trying to fight a Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne trio, he tries out to find who is the mysterious Batwoman. <br /> <br /> There's nothing noticeable about it, but there's nothing really special about it <br /> <br /> Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce's long lost love surface and messed with his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was an important event in the life of Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Even the Batman Beyond movie turns off, Return of the Joker, dug deeply with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman has some small subplots, a lot of formula put on a boat through a mediocre setpiece. Honestly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, without the punch and bite the Animated Series had in its first.
