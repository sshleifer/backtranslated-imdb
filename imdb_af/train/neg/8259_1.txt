I saw this movie back when it was premiered. <br /> <br /> It was based on the idea that autistic children with spoken messages can communicate with someone else who just helps them and leads their hands. <br /> <Then suddenly these kids, many of whom didn't even hear the keyboard or screen when the messages were typed (they could sometimes look up the ceiling), but their moderators were glued eyes on the keyboard, started typing messages of abuse of their parents and other persons, sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy, left and right. <br /> <br /> This whole thing proved to be a mistake when a third person opened a guide, opened it to the child, and said "type the picture you see" and as the presenter the guide to the moderator will fall and fold a different picture. <br /> <br /> So while the kid might have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time, every flower time typed the name of the picture that the moderator observed, never what the child showed. <br /> <br /> So what did the typing do? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This movie also had a disastrous turn, as the Australian poster said, the person who molested the child in the movie, in the situation trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert never put her son in place, he wouldn't be molested, that's what the movie says. He was better under her supervision. <br /> <br /> If I transfer my child to your organization for help and he is molested instead, do you think I'd be eager to listen to anything you should say afterwards? Not likely! I think it's a safe bet that all these accused messages that make up these kids, on which this movie is based, never accused anyone of it as it happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remembered that the movie gave Gilbert a very good performance as the autistic mother, but otherwise, the movie didn't really do much. <br /> <br /> The worst was by far the kid typing at the end of Patty Duke, and we heard the mechanical voice reading what he typed. . . . . "we won!" This child was molested. If you cut off my leg and bring you to court and you are found guilty of harm to me, assault, whatever, then it is justice, but it doesn't bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> At best, in my state, I'll see it as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> The chances of this child having what is normally seen with autism are further damaged by molestation. <br /> <A 'normal' child has enough to fight with such an experience. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you have to look at any situation and "win" if that person is found guilty. in court. <br /> <br /> Just dealing with a situation and circumstances completely here.
