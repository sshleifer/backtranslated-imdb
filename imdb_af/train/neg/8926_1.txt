I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it only came out in 1970. At that time I was a healthy 20-year-old who had movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. In addition, I read the Gore Vidal novel on which it was based and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie at a local driveway and about halfway through. I was very tempted to turn the car off my car so I might die of monoxide poisoning and not see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. . It wasn't "smart" or "trendy", it was rough and messy. All the actors were deaf and the director did not have the slightest idea he did. Mae West's decisive decision was one of the worst decisive choices in film history. As one reviewer has said, her role has nothing to do with the film or book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten by the young stud, who never for the legendary Me. West will not. Oh no, the plot has changed so she is sexually beaten, very credible by a 77-year-old woman who looks at her age every day. I can go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
