The dudes at MST3K should see this dog from a movie. It's basically a dull Hollywood hack actor who can't land acting. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this dumb actor do? He colored his hair blonde and started acting like a L.A. surfer dude in the naive hope, it will get him role players. You will cover your head with so much of this movie's unintentional funny scenes. Like when the actor's girlfriend's friend is sad and sighs and lines like "How can you do this for me?" And why is she crying? Cos has painted his hair blonde and has become a surfer man who has performed acting. This movie doesn't make sense! The actor who played the governor at Benson is also here and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with a very dumb funny dialogue. This movie will run you out, trust me. Are you talking to me ?!
