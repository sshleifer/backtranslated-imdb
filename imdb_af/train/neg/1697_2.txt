I'm a big fan of David Lynch and have everything he made on DVD, except for Hotel Room and the 2 hour Twin Peaks movie. When I found out, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what is it? It is a bunch of roughly drawn black and white cartoons that are hard and dirty and mighty. Maybe I don't know what is good, but maybe it's just a bunch of shit that is sung under the name David Lynch to make a few bucks. Let me make it clear that I don't share the dirty language, but had to adjust the sound because my neighbors might have. All in all, it's a very disappointing release, and may just be left in the deluxe boxing as a curiosity. I recommend not spending your money on this. 2 out of 10.
