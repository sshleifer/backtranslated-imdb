As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone has actually been paid to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors for the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" to the series has been terrible! The original series is based on historical facts about a man who was a good strategist, leader and fighter. A man who played a major role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> However, the plot of this movie is nothing but a writer who whispered it from the bottom of the bar during the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, which saves distorted slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile? <br /> <br /> I was expecting blonde, busty women to be out of nowhere and running across the screen in their little red bathing suits, for no apparent reason. Not that it would have been more bizarre than the fantastic plot line that probably dreamed after 10 pint of beer at a party party, where someone's fun dress inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next one.
