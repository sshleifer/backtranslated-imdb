There seem to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an IMDb review before or since. Given the very low average rating given by other people to the film, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie. I will admit, I thought the concept was cute, and I was pleased to see that the actresses Eva and Harmony played on Angel's work, but it didn't take long for the horror of this movie to itself Not known. <br /> <br /> Acting: The leaders were capable enough but everyone else? Terror. <br /> <br /> Plot: Beat full holes big enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: Non-existence. <br /> <br /> Humor: Did They Really Think People Laugh? O boy. <br /> <br /> Eyecup: OK. there were some very nice women in this movie. Not just the three main female characters, but across the board. It was as if the producers were hoping that the view would be so impressed that they would not see how terrible everything was. If so, they failed failed. <br /> <br /> In the right hands it could have been cute, but dark funny camp classic. It wasn't even close.
