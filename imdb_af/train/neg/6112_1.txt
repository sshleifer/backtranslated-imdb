I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16 times in Germany, I entered the movie as a relapse. It was so boring. Then I realized that it was just a little where a man exhibited his wife. I mean today you do it via the internet and you pay for instant access. It's been over 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I'm wasting my time with this movie. This is a soft porn for schoolgirls. Defrost Bo Derek and paint hair with color - nice. But then they must call the movie Undressing Bo and her painter.
