The Christmas secret was a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the movie when it was over, which made me think the producers were very proud of this project. As a screen actor myself, I felt most of the performances, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not resume this movie otherwise. It was an embarrassment. I was a fan since his Waltons days, but I found myself unable to look at any of his subsequent work, so this offer was poor. <br /> <br /> In defense of the actors, directing was stilted, mechanically, and thoroughly amateurish. <br /> <br /> I hope it's not considered a disappointing review and negative assumption about my critics qualifications. I started the movie because it played a good role and I was prepared to enjoy the movie. However, I would challenge anyone out there to watch this movie and not want their money back, even if it was on T.V.
