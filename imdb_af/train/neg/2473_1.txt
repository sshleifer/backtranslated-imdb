If my grandmother made movies, they would probably do much better than this one ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (the mother, father and son) are OK. Special is the mother, she is a nice actress and the child, also a nice one on the scene where he is frightening. But the director knows the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. The writing does not have a developing atmosphere to become an exciting thing. If you like to be chased by trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise you just stay home and sleep. oh ... actually there was something funny: the movie is from 2001 but we couldn't realize it, as the picture is so bad (like on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70s and 80s).
