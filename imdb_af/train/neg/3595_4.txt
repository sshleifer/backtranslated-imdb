I was not so happy as some of the other comments made on this movie: I've never seen anything else ... we'll say ... a wonderful thought from Sarno. I agree with many: some actresses who do a lot of time topless and dance are not really that attractive. I like Fraulein Crank (?). She was so at home, she was cute! The acting was pretty presumptuous, but although delivering lines in a second language might account for much of that problem. To follow the plot was an important task: was there one, really? I agree warmly with another comment: for a vampire movie there is not much blood. Yes, if you want a GOOD blood sugar, look at such Hammer classics as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Dracula's Brides". <br /> <br /> The most (unintentional) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats ... you never see! ... the bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Good as a time warmer if you get it going Cable here in the Great White, but don't rent it for heaven's sake!
