Tromaville High has become an amoral desert, due to the disadvantage of the nearby nuclear power plant's accidental release of toxic waste. <br /> <br /> Unrestrained chaos packed with absurd violence and gross behavior. Rather terribly, obviously meant to be, messing up a movie with the filmmakers who detach the reins, so that the undisputed curiosity can be at hand. Craft was far from Troma's list of goals for this gory sleaest. The honorary association is punks with fearless face painting and wacky outfits. The German teacher who joins, through a "poisonous kiss" becomes the stripes on one side of her face that really gave me the creeps. The poisonous monster, which sent the ANNOYING punks to the end, is quite cool. br /> <br /> Kind of physical connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly.
