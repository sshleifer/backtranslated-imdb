Scotty (Grant Cramer, who will die in the big B movie "Killer Klowns from Outer Space") agrees to help three parents learn how to "dialogue" the ladies in the bad 80's comedy. Not bad as in the 80's lingo, which means good. Bad as in bad. With no beloved characters, including but not limited to a child who has been a girl since Friday the 13th, who is the best men, a girl training men and then hissing when they want to touch her and the sign fat slob because after all that would be an '80s sex comedy without a fat slob ?? Well, this one has two. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the 80's sex comedies. And then the successor began to deepen such a proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: too much to count, you even see the freaky looking kid who is thought of with boobs. think of "Bachlor Party", but not so funny, and VERY disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
