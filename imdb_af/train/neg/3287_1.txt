If this movie is to be renamed, it must be "The Jackasses or Hazzard". To sum it up, this movie is just 88 minutes from two immature puppies that drove the famous Dodge Charger around the town and in the country in 1968, pursued the girls and evacuated the law. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of the "Dukes" and what upset the movie is the characters outside the key. The over-capacity of profanity, sexual references and drug use made the good name of the "Dukes" in trailer waste. <br /> <br /> From the comparison to the television program, the play was terrible. The only actor who managed it was the famous Dodge Charger called General Lee. The other has exaggerated the character's role that the movie has ignored. <br /> <br /> The "Dukes" was another accident of the 21st century Hollywood drama big screen transition. Skip this movie and just buy the TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
