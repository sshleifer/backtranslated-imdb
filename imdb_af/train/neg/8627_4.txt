Although it is generally a cheesy jungle adventure movie, it does have some highlights: the settings are pretty nice and the rhythm of the adventure is good. You won't be bored to watch it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as quick as possible to play the unified head, an unashamed drunken jungle guide that guided Shanghai in the guided rich boy Van Hoffman and his beautiful wife Douche on a hunting expedition into cannibal land . He never takes things seriously. Shower is there as decoration and Keith makes great use of her - she doesn't have to do much. She is not the only female to show her body and the exciting aspects of the film make it about half way on a T / A photo. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that will pay particular attention to or away from it. Produced to succeed, it succeeds without too much fuss. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
