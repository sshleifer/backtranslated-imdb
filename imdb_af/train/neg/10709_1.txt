I can't think much about this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie ... I can't even tell you what made me decide to see it. It had so few redeeming qualities that I didn't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot moved from undeniable to straight absurd. My whole body was tense for the duration of the movie because I couldn't wait for the terrible thing to be. By the end of the movie I relieved myself. <br /> <br /> Editing was poor, the acting was substandard, and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson was thrown as a native American, although she doesn't even look like someone from native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie is going to be this idiot, it should be pretty stupid - at least. It wasn't. It was just pathetic.
