We all knew even before it was broadcast, the Ron Moore mini series is no Battlestar Galactica. It is good. It just means it has to stand on its own. It can't lean on Battlestar Galactica. If it's good, it's good on its own merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If reports are true, that's what Moore wanted. However, if he has his mini-series of rocks, he has shamed all the excellent actors on the screen, not the multiple off-screen staff. And that's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini series is no remake. I won't even mention it. It's a new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not occur in the Galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. It does not tell of the Galactica's quest for the thirteenth tribe. It also doesn't rely on the legends and mysteries that Galactica supported. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space opera, action movie with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, "just another" space opera, action movie. Because as plots go, he has little original or even interesting. I could surrender the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. But I won't put it to you. I'll just hit the main point. Ready now? Here it is: Just look at the trailer. It will tell you everything in the story. <br /> <br /> Yes, man's creations turn and try to destroy man. (I think they have forgotten Azimov's rules again.) They look like people, so there's the whole stranger under our thing. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore of Galactica, that ceremonial note, came from more carnival than respect. I mean, can't he even think of his own? <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes I wanted to look something else. I don't care about Moore's characters, as I couldn't identify with any of them. This fact struck me when the Cylons started their attack. Armageddon on a planet hall, and I didn't give a damn. How depressed. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes, when faced with an insurmountable stumbling block, instead of conquering it, save a decent tailtail and their own stumps. It was the only way to save mankind, yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe way out rather than risking their own lives to defend others. At least the horror is not apathy. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, the Ron Moore mini series was just a goal-less activity, a movie on a treadmill. And I just wanted it to be over. And by the time it was over, my life force sucked from me. For my own sake, I was becoming a senseless, sultry zombie, probably of the type this mini-series would appeal to. I had to supplement myself. I had to - and I swear it's true - I had to look at an episode of Babylon. 5. Two episodes, and I felt much better. And happier.
