Years ago, a movie went, and I went to see a horror movie we thought would be good, because it played John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, writer and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated three times for Oscars. He has written and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself. Until we saw the Incubus, we didn't understand that John Cassavetes's income was made from any movie he offered. If we knew what the movie was about, before we saw it, we could have completely avoided it. But we didn't go out. At that time, my friend and I said it was the worst movie ever made. Now, honestly, that's not true. On Friday night I watched very bad movies at Cinemax (I just said it out loud) that was worse than the Incubus. Almost any movie with Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus conquered the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus. However, since then I have consistently used the Incubus as a threshold within which I do not want to fall. If I talk to this friend about a movie I might have seen, I'll always notice it's better (or worse) than the Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
