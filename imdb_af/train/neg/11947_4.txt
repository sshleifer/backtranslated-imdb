An interesting change from the first one. There was more mystery for this movie than the first. Even when it ends, you ask yourself what happened to who was the killer. There are a few good parts in the movie, the first half starts slowly and then in the last half the pace is up. All the movie is enjoyable. The story is 22 years after the events that took place in the first movie. Norman Bates is from an asylum and back to the Bates motel, but as a woman seems to be his real mother, things are going wrong. Perkins is playing an elderly Norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent, he swam heavily.
