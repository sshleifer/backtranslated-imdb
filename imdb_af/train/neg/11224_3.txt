... and even then, even they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this movie (if anyone is meant to name it) is only important for bondage freaks. Bettie Page supporters will learn nothing new (and I mean * nothing *), and they will not enjoy the hot fuzzies of being known, loved or cherished. <br /> <br /> Never be the careless script, the wood, the less-than-community acting, the total absence of direction, the crappy lighting, or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values. It's definitely "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" movie-up of the lowest order. I think I can be grateful that at least they knew how to run the camera. No, it's a pity to say that nothing of it is why this thing is so right. * Wrong. <br /> <br /> It's wrong because the young lady plays Bettie Page, a somewhat cute girl whose only deal for the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the brand bang, and that means nothing but the willingness to be tied and cut. This is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this miserable remnant, but not for the miserable remains herself, consisting mainly of a number of lovingly reassessed B & D pieces that are between terribly horrible faux-biographical scenes is delimited. Me. . Page's fall of grace (to speak). There is actually more information, per se, about the page's life in the openings and closing requirements than the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. This is not a worthy companion movie to the "Notorious Bettie Page." It's not a worthy movie at all. It is a fetish piece that does the allure of one of the greatest game-ups of all time, and does it without class, without style, and without any real understanding of the character of Bettie Page whatsoever. No real Bettie Page fan will find it a disappointment, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. As free, remember that time is also money. Yours may not be worth much, but I bet it's worth it to be sorry, you have time with this one mess. That's it, I'm done, you're warned.
