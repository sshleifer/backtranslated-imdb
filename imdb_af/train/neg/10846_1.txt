Not since Caligula did I consider turning the movie halfway through ... but then with this one I was only 15 minutes when I considered it. Unfortunately, I went through it all the time. Make sure you don't. <br /> <br /> It is not the cradle of fear, is shocking or stingy or scary or scary or sexual. That's that it's not one of those things, but desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it is boring, thin, ordinary, predictable and unintentionally poorly executed (shot at video, special special effects from high school, no sense for even basic visual narration, dialogue barely audible ... not that worth it is not). /> <br /> This movie proves the argument that even the straight-to-video distributors have to pull a line somewhere in the sand.
