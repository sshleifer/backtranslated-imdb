Like others have noticed, this movie is a burden of pretentious fool for the senseless or masochist. <br /> <br /> We all know after seeing a sting and sour house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid home without a good dose of humor or eager realism movies like this work. And more importantly, without a decent script, a movie won't work and there's nothing new, inspirational or thoughtful about the movie for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie has won some Bafta shows, how bad is the British film industry right now. I thought the Aussie film industry was currently very bad, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad I won't even bother renting it from the weekly section. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide cab.
