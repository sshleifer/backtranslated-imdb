Visually tampering, plot less, incredibly indignant garbage. Not even near Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping split screen effects do nothing more than confuse, the movie is very dark for much of the time and the 'artistic' image of images is pretentious in the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; even the nudity is incredibly untrustworthy, as it fills a great deal of the film, it becomes boring quickly. <br /> <br /> Plus, how anyone can say that Ewen MacGregor's play is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more abilities in the Star Wars series, and it says something. <br /> <br /> I didn't have such a movie because I saw 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'!
