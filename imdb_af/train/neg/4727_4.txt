This film is really something of a curate's egg, good in parts. Unlike other reviewers, I found the biggest mistake with the inability to pull the viewer's interest in the characters and the plot. I sat there because I was interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands, but if I were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie, I would have to deliver it with a few examples: Jason Behr is good at joining John Livien, and pretty convincing as a rock singer; The story of his childhood drama is unclear, although we give tips in Livien's well-related relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre to the viewer (what it should not be). Yet the idea of ​​using a stage person to solve inner conflicts is interesting, even if it is not novel or complete as a theme in this movie. The remarks to John Lennon were annoying, but I admit I'm not a Beatles fan. Anyway, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that something was distracted from them. Another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it was opened with some interesting - though middle-bro and high school - philosophical mockery of the main character, but left the threads of his mind there, just to get them back in the middle of the movie very short, when Livien says, "before God, there was music" (ever seen the ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "Before that time there was Tia Maria"). It seems to be an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he has achieved it, but he is entitled to it. Fortunately, his bass guitar and friend, little played by Dominic Monaghan, acknowledged the mistake of thinking when he responded: "You don't know." <br /> <br /> In all the limited strengths of the direction and the plot, either future projects, useless banality, or an interesting and mature perspective.
