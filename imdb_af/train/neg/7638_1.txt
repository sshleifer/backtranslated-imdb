I couldn't even bring myself to see this movie. I can't comment on the story because I didn't watch the whole movie and the reason I couldn't see it was because of the 'actors'. First of all, they mostly looked tight and I'm sure their scripts were in their hands just outside the frame - but that's a small problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault. It's everyone who plays this role! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought people who played teens in the late twenties came out with new wave? I can't watch a movie where one of the first lines, of an adult man who is older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Don't become a victim of this movie, go for 90 minutes and you'll get much more than this movie ever could.
