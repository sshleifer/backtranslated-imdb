Dan Duryea, a perfectly decent B-movie actor who made many watchers in the 1940s, can't do much with this one: the young man is accused of killing an unlucky married singer; when he is sentenced to death, his wife decides to settle the case with the help of the death wife's husband. After a brilliant opening shot, flick quickly gets into the B movie formula. It certainly looks good, but the turning effect is colorless and the movie (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a little tight. Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel, and accessible to a single look. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
