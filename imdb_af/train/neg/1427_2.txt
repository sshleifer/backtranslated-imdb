The British claymation series has a "witty" conversation stuck with "average" people in the mouth of "cute" imaginative creatures, at least benefiting non-British viewers of apparent droll and the kind of raref cultured humor that you couldn't get it. American television. Someone made the mistake of placing it on American television. <br /> <br /> Similar to the unlucky American version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING who died in a month on NBC when the same basic scripts did not "translate" from British English to American English, which dropped in England and grown (and just a BIT sow), come in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as if just boring with dolls. There is no plot line, no characters and after watching one and a half episodes (of the three eventually broadcast), there is no reason to suffer more. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the gracious short run it had is that the clay is at least professionally done and comes as a set-up for the single worst show on the CBS schedule, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "how to be a terrible mother - or someone - in one tireless, unfinished lesson"), children who want to stay before their bedtime have rather walked rather than going through this show, and the adults can agree to 'two and a half men' (guilty pleasure) until 21:00 and "How do I meet your mother" (real quality writing) come on.
