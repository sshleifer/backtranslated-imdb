Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the strangest talented actors out there. But his choice of films, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not seem to realize how to use his talents. He would have been better off working with more Cubics of the film world than the people he did. Some of his later films have only impressed me with the "Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There". <br /> <br /> That said, the Boultings and Sellers made some movies before this time. It doesn't sound that bad - I still have "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" saw. - at least in the sense of using Sellers well. But, "There's a girl in my soup" is really a poor movie and a huge choice on Sellers' part in terms of character. In his films from 1955-64, you can usually expect some very inventive quarrels and always a mysterious belief in his roles. Here you tried Peter Sellers to play a typical romantic lead. It's almost Sellers who play a Niven caddy without the joviality. He certainly doesn't convince, try as he wants, or create an interesting character. He had to leave such parts to sovereign masters like Cary Grant, concentrating on the intriguing dramatic and comic roles he was famous for. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers really do not create real chemistry; It's not an easy, brilliant romance of the will that is perfect by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is very artificial, all the way through - I know it's part of Danvers' character that he is a dry attorney of ladies, but it doesn't really change in a way that convinces. Sellers also have a very red way to play "charm". This character really has no depth and really doesn't get the viewer's sympathy or interest. Vendors go through the movements in a way that one would not possibly imagine if he remembers the wonder of his different iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". There is really nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, so frankly they leave little or no impression. It's really one of the most anemic, smug, deceptive, and light-skinned movies I've ever seen. A nonentity of a "vehicle" for Sellers' undisputed talents. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
