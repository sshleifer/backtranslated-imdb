I had several problems with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) The screenplay - specifically Kim Basinger's voice on: Movies are not books; they should * show the action * rather than a voice over * tell * us what happens. Sometimes I find a movie with a voice about what works, but here it was more of a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it sounded like she was reading excerpts from the novel in her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I didn't feel any emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carter's acting was pretty bad. It is a significant failure for me to define Jessie and Thomas's characters - with no connection between them, it seemed to me that she just wanted a stud and it was an issue for him to be deprived of sex . If done properly, the relationship between them would have given more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With this book I understood Jessie's middle crisis. In the movie it looks more than just boredom. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I didn't think the movie was as bad as turning me off the TV. . . although that thought occurred to me.
