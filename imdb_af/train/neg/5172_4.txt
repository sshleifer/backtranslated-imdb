This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past weekend, The Gravedancers were the first. Grave dancers were better. I can only guess watching that production had to be fairly limited. I will admit that the story started out interesting, but eventually got fit for me. We didn't really give time to sympathize or understand any characters, which only made each of their erratic features even more annoying. I have to mention that a 12-year-old boy who acts as a Sheriff was also a bit disappointed. The only reason I sat all over the movie was to find out what the big secret was, which seems to be not that interesting. Even more background about the family would have helped, but they didn't look like a family at all. <br /> <br /> For me this movie is so amateur that I couldn't even see it on DVD. The four ratings are for the initial potential the story might have had. It was one to hit for horrorfest.
