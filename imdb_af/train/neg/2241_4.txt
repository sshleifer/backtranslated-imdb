I remember enjoying it for a few more years, but coming back to it, I wonder why. I think it always looks good and the girls do pretty well, but the men leave the side rather. Why, why in so many English movies about sex, should we have such indifferent men along the pretty girls? In addition, it starts predictably enough as a gender prisoner similar to the Confessions movies, but about a third of the way through (as we begin to enjoy the beautiful Me Me Lai), the film asks us to start it take seriously. Not only that, but the central rock club and cannabis order is very forced and just silent. In short, it is not as innocent as foolish or as intelligent as it seems to be. Richard O'Sullivan, as such a central figure, could have helped, but I think it's one of his worst performances. Just worth the ladies.
