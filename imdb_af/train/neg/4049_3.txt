I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80's. I tried again to see if my aversion to this movie in my 80s was in my movie, or was it 'Stripes' is just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" may be innovative comedy in the early 80's and can appeal to people who have been through basic training. or who are Bill Murray fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mostly because "Stripes" is supposed to be a comedy, but it's just not funny. There are a few laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable when you get used to more contemporary comedies such as "Anchorman" that strive for laughter in every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" continue to suffer from Bill Murray's and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this stage in his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough to act as the dramatic bow of the movie. Lastly, most of the comedies in "Stripes" revolve around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec male child character, so if you don't find that character funny (as I didn't), you're not going to find most of the little comedy that is also in Stripes. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is very much a movie of its era, it is not well-aged and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's "buddy" comedy, I'd recommend it to be a pair of glasses. Like 'Stripes', the humor in 'Stir Crazy' is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike 'Stripes' it played much better and as a result it is still visible.
