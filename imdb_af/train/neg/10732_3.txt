The Russian film, "4," follows the lives of three (not four) strangers meeting one night in a local bar. One is a musician, one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl. <br /> <br /> "4," I am collecting is meant to show the sadness and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have made stories to make their lives look more interesting than they really is, but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people can put it through. There is apparently a proposal running through the film, that the shadow Russian government stands on some shade behind the scenes - industry secret cloning facilities, selling decade-old frozen meat, etc. - But the movie is so unformatted and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone can find out what someone really is here. <br /> <br /> Despite decent acting and some spectacular plays, "4" is a two-hour endurance competition that should be avoided at all costs.
