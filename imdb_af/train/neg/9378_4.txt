This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was quite surprised that the company could take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as needed to reach the street scaffolding. The film is pretty and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute but overworked. Eileen Brennan surpassed even more. Good for small children, or for those who love fluff in large doses. A 4 out of the Miller Movies formula.
