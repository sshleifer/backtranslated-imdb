<br /> <br /> At the conclusion of my view of "Trance" or "The Eternal", or whatever the producers call this movie, I wondered: "From all the bad movies I could see, Couldn't I have seen at least one that was entertaining? "Even if a movie isn't made up in terms of acting, directing, writing or what you have, it can be fun, and therefore worth it. But not only is this film bad in artistic value, it's incredibly boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves extremely slowly, with little dramatic tension. At least, in a low-hint entertainment attempt, the deaths of the characters could have been cool and / or greedy, but the creators of this drink also failed in that department. <br /> <br /> What is this movie about? Like nothing, unless you get entertained to watch Christopher Walken, who is able to be brilliant, put so little effort into his play that he falls into the self-paced mode (WHY did he decide to do?). <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because God helps us, there is actually worse movies made before.
