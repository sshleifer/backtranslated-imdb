After reading the novel before I saw this movie, I was very disappointed with the woodworkers and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard for the plot. I feel that this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, rather giving the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensation of the film after a short 2 hours, the film lost many of the key functions that make the book understandable and progressive, thus resulting in a somewhat jumping plot with little foundation. There is no building on the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it seems rather sudden and unfounded, as the two characters have such an irregular interaction, you can't imagine their "love" is superficial. It is such an injustice for Bronte's novel, you get no impression of Jane's strange cheek and boldness that Rochester puts on her, and his arrogance that Jane lures for him. <br /> <br /> Despite poor writing, I think some characters were portrayed very spectacularly, namely Fairfax and Grace Poole, but production was generally poor. Given a better scripting, maybe the movie would be more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for outstanding production.
