Well, I think I should be the one who says, "The emperor has no clothes." When I listed this show for PBS last night, I was both hopeful and worried. I loved "Morse" (even as far as buying the full DVD set) and feeling it while I always like Kevin Whately's Sgt. Lewis character, the show was John Thaw, period! After looking at the new "Inspector Lewis", I'm even more convinced that I'm right. What is good, though he looks terrible (both very old and too fat), but he's simply not having the charisma to wear the show like Thaw. <br /> <br /> And for his "sidekick" Fox, well ... Perhaps the judges here from England will understand what he says, but I could mostly not. <br /> <br /> What Mrs. Innocent ... all I can say is miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say they must have left "Morse" resting in peace.
