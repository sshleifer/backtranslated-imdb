Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, strangers and the search for immortality. <br /> <br /> The women are beautiful and the photography is beautiful. That dialogue is empty. It's a ridiculous mess. Great to watch, but as a look at a horror movie or thriller, but just awful. I try to find out if we should be scared or not. At the same time, is it a plant or not? It's a weird mix of art movie and horror that never quite whine and while it's nice to watch, it never seems to mean anything and it's not scary at all, though occasionally shot or sequence. create a moment of frisson. pretentious twaddle. Something to give in the background as a living wallpaper for those who love naked women.
