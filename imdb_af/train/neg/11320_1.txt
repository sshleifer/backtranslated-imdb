someone needs to make a car payment ... it's really awful ... let jean Claude's cyborg look like the wind ... it's an hour i wish i could sue to get back. Fortunately, it caused serious somnolence ... from which I fell asleep. how can actors of this caliber create this dog? I'd rather spend the time watching how algae grow on the side of a fish tank as part of this utterly terrible merger of various genres. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at Walmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really have to, wait until they throw them out after they have been on the stock for years and are frustrated that they would not sell . <br /> Please for the love of God let this movie die of darkness.
