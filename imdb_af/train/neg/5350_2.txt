Yes, talk about bad successors. Rick Moranis stars in this terrible third sequel to the one-funny and entertaining "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the children being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. If you think it sounds interesting, think again. The movie is boring at best. This is the worst in embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the continuity of the series was completely flushed in the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors who play the kids have changed, those who play the neighbors have changed ... you call it. They are trying to make us believe it's the same family, but the results are riddling to say the least. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the story is a rehash of the first, with no part of originality. All the few jokes (and hardly any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, special effects. I'm sure it's done on a smaller budget, but they're pathetic, much worse than the rest of the series. You are supposed to surprise these little figures in the vast interior area, but you will probably take up most of the time. <br /> <br /> Fourth problem, finding the action inside the house is just boring. Only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not excited at all. The first movie was amusing because the kids handled nature, the grass and the insects living in it. In this one, the adults (who appear as boring compared to the children) deal with dust, cockroach and cockroach fall. It's hard. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the idea of ​​introducing such a solid successor to the already moribund series addressed Disney executives, except perhaps because they needed to bring in cash without spend five minutes on something new. I warn you: leave this tasteless cash in the garbage where it should stay: to get dust on the shelves of the store.
