I wanted this movie. It has a nice jail sentence, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a completely boring 80s touch. This is an attempt by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guess) a bad man. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wood and there is no nightmare / scary moment there. It just goes on and off, and then it must (logically) end. More tension and more daring visuals and his fate as a cult classic would have been sealed.
