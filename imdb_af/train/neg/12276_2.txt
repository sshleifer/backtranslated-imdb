The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately it came apart due to a poor / indescribable story line, miscasting and general lack of content / substance. One of the obvious shortcomings was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, didn't know how to declare his own Arabic name! It may seem a small mistake, but it indicates the apparent lack of effort to pay attention to details. The quality of acting was uniformly well below average. <br /> <br /> Film's lonely saving grace was the turn of the plot at the end; and a French song (I don't remember the title). Overall, it was a very bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly overlooked.
