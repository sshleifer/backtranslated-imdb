If you like to see animals shone alive, their heads shattered, the cats of the dogs bruised, my men pounded on them, then this one is for you! But if you are a bit normal and do not see real footage of animal cruelty, this one succeeds. This movie is trying to shock the viewer, and it does. With the animal sniffing at the beginning, and killing babies in the movie (at least fake), it was enough to make me turn. I saw movies like this show showing massacre (BTK film) and this kind of material should not be allowed into a horror movie. We look at gore and horror because we know its make-up and special effects so we don't have to sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, that's not what we rented the movie for. If there is something, there must be a great warning label on these types of garbage films so people have won it; it is not surprised. As a very hardcore horror fan, this one has changed my stomach. The whole movie and crew must check their heads.
