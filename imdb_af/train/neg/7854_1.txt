wow this is the worst movie ever. So the only reason I joined IMDb was to complain about this movie. I've never walked out of a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped this one (and I had to). but I looked at it all the way to just dropping off with an absolutely horrible end. Wow, if it's all that the craven can produce, its time is long. I have never seen the first one and will never look at it. It is terribly observing with a terrible plot. hey someone seems to pour a mirror from us can check it out. And the sad part is that when this movie comes to DVD, it's totally picked for eternity. so i feel bad for all the people who have seen this litter.
