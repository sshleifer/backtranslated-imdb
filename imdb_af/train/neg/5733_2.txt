I just watched it, my better half and I couldn't believe how terrible and bad it was. If someone else thinks it's good, then you should be easily satisfied. I actually stood out for an evening to see it, it was all done before. Internet Explorer. hostel has your mind, but at least it didn't hurt you with the bad acting and the lack of storyline, the same old things, repeatedly, i read so much about this movie, i even recommended it to my friends, my fault, someone said it was good! No more gory, horror or reeling back in dislike if your average scary movie should be said, please don't save with this movie. get mary poppins. now it's scary! I'm out now, go to the cinema and watch something scarier than that, maybe miss the sunshine
