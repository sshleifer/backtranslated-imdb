The second attempt by New York intellectuals in less than 10 years to make a Swedish movie - the first is Susan Sontag's Brother Carl (made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said best, referring to Dickens's "The Old Curiosity Shop": "One must have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at Little Nell's death." Much the same thing here. "Interiors" is a bunch of solemn, intimate cryers. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Look at the middle distance: "I don't like who I am getting.") The director quotes (to use a polite term of Bergman) are near parody. The incredibly self-reliant family remembers us how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("I read a poem from yours the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker." "Oh, it was an old poem. I processed it.") Far from caring about these people However, I found them hilarious. Much of the dialogue is exactly like the funny things about Allen's previous films - only he directed his actors to play the lines straight. After not putting him in the film, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt, copying all of his concoctions, intonations and neurotic habits, making her into an embarrassing story (like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quiet dominant mom - seems more or less of Bergman's "Winter Light" lifted, the basic family melodrama surfaced with many existential fears. It's all in the shop-printed visual / hearing stories: the deafening scraping of a pencil on paper, the wandering surf that people walk on the beach. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Allen's later "serious" movies are less embarrassing, but less entertaining. I will "Interiors." Woody rarely made a funny movie.
