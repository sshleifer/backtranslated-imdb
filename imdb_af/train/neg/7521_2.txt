I probably give it more credit than it deserves because it's Halloween, I was just at "Knott's Scary Farm" and I was in a mood to watch a very cute Halloween movie. Oh, and it just costs me one dollar. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would come out with a movie like this to get the good stuff, but I resisted the urge here and I'm not sure why. It was clear from the opening shots, it wasn't a "real" movie, not even a B-movie. It's more in the category of the DeCoteau horror movies such as "The Brotherhood" shot at movie-watching video for about 50 cents (I was actually scared, one of his beef colleagues boys would rub him in his underpants or something). There were no cutaway shots (too expensive to do more camera setup) and flat lighting, but ... it's hard to figure out. There is something refreshing to watch a director without money to pick up a half-decent movie. The fact that he does even a half decent job is commendable, and this movie has its share of merit. The play is not bad, photography is pretty good (if it is too scary to be scary), there are a few surprises, and the whole thing is kind of ... otherwise somehow. <br /> <br /> A lot of college kids are (for some unknown reason) stuck in the warehouse where they decorate the annual haunted house. A Greek old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally make up the powers of hell. As a result, the people bought are in the haunted house that they have created and cause a lot of chaos and human suffering. Along the way we are treated to a strangely complex and thoughtful lesbian subplot relationship - it is interesting that this couple is best finished in the movie. Yes, there is a sex scene, but it's not nice - or at least no more than you find in any legitimate lesbian movie that shows that they have sex. It's quite unusual for a horror movie to take the time and effort to do it without using cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> The other thing about my interest was how it clearly tried to meet the "stupid kids, have sex and killed" from the 80's. It's hard to accept it because there are so many of those movies already in existence, the genre has been killed. I don't know if it's good or bad that these filmmakers simply try to make another entry in that genre without irony, as if it were another living genre, but I appreciated the effort. <br /> <br /> Which is why I put it through it; Sometimes you just want to watch an incomprehensible, no budget, "A-for-effort" horror movie. There was really too much set-up, not enough gore, endless plots, dead and clich√©s, and the unfortunate overall feeling of a movie that simply didn't have enough money to be the movie the producers claimed ... but at least haunted houses were pretty cool. I will pay to go to that haunted house if it exists and don't mind paying a dollar to watch it on DVD, even if I will never see it again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** possible spoiler **, but there was a big, brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin: "I was once claustrophobic. But I changed." Ha ha, good one.
