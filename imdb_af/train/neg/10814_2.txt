As a Jane Eyre fan I was excited when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will make this book in a movie following the story actually written by the author." Wrong!!! If the deciding director intended to throw a "Jane" that was simple, he certainly succeeded. But surely he could have found that could act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the ghostly tension of the novel when the night's laughter seemed to have turned from nowhere? Where was the glitter of the child who flourished and danced like her mother? Finally, why did the plot end up changing? One wonders if the authors actually read the book. What a disappointment
