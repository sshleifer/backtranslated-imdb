I remember that show. I still remember the kick-ass song "America's Funniest People." Honestly it had to be called the American's lame or unfunny or straight disgusting people. Dave couldn't save this show, nor did Bob Saget or AFV's replacement hosts come later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes Dave could make good voyages that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos that people submitted. It also evolved as a bit of a variety show with lame guest stars, including the Olson Twins. Plus, AFV, was in the forefront before they chose the fun badly as sin babies than the winner. Did I say the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the theme song rocks!
