It's very sad that Lucian Pintilie doesn't stop making movies. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) are a depressing sting at the camera. It is unfortunate that some of the many films made annually in Romania are the worst of them being sent abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a plot, acting or text is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
