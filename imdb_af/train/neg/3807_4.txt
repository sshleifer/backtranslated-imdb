Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Woody's movies, of course his late 70's masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his 80's / early 90's dramas (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Men and women), I even liked some of its more recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks), but it was uncomfortable, although it might not be worse than last year's Match Point, but how wrong was. <br /> <br /> It's well plotted - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes being pulled out. Woody also seems to be on the way out and has most of his lines and the delivery of 'hilarious' slogans 'I mean it with all respect ...' over and over until its merging gets too bald. <br /> <br /> I know most actors are in the queue. to work with him, but first have to read the script. Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than that - and in the future, Woody should really be behind the role of the movie if he feels about 20 miles. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't compare so many good woody movies to it - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and to judge this effort, Woody should call a day before becoming a journalist. <br /> <br /> Outrageously bad
