Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I've experienced a movie that literally had no meat or potatoes in it. The whole movie felt that it was just the salad without a main course. The story line was illegible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, realism was out of the window and the animation was done by four-year-olds. Is this the case? I have never been embarrassed by a concept throughout my life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the other reviews I am not from the base. <br /> <br /> To begin, the story went too fast. For someone new to this character and situation, I needed more to create the reasons instead of finding the solution. I saw other Anime (if you can call this anime) who do good characters with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing set aside for Lady Death. In a few short plays we see her train with Cremator and it immediately becomes an aggressive animal of hell. It was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was introduced as this poor and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly she is immersed in hatred and can struggle with a existence that lasts for millions of years. This was absurd. The representation of Lady Death was poor, to say the least. I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the spirit. It just didn't work for me. She was nothing more than an eye for prepubescent boys who had to unleash the mass of skin she had suddenly grown on her chest during training with Cremator. Oh, I felt sick just to look at her. The same goes for Cremator's character. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than real development. It's a very sad day in hell when we leave characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature. <br /> <br /> Next was Lucifer himself. Let me just say I think I can make war with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was laughing and he not only suggested the image I had in my mind. It's as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him semi-PC. He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature Lucifer embodied. He was not the Ruler of Hell, but instead, only a pants that had a greater place to live. Talk about life or death, how can you die again in hell? It was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most characters were worried about dying when they didn't even think they were dead. That's how they came to hell. I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the movie for me. I didn't realize the idea that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but it can only be me ?? or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built, but preparation. <br /> <br /> The battle order was hysterically bad. The animation in this cartoon felt that it was made in the early 90's. There was nothing impressive about the way this movie was drawn. Why are we, America, so behind animation? It's big in Asia, and it's crawling in hardcore, because we keep making films like Lady Death that don't challenge or use any imagination. We're cheap, and this movie shows it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad. The animation along with the terrible voice work was cheap. I had a head somewhere that this movie, as in production for a long time, which is difficult to understand because I think I could have made this movie on my credit card. The production was terrible as well as the story. Nothing was developed, with huge gaping plot holes that almost all invaded. The strength of the characters was lacking, and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this one and want to warn others so when death comes you are not in my state and regret wasting 80 minutes on this garbage. <br /> <br /> Babble! <br /> <br /> Degree: * Off *****
