It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has any skill, but the writing is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear a serious dialogue that goes: "I love you more." "No, I prefer you." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. Her "southern girl charm" just doesn't work and is really very annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines as she reads the writing right next to the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before he agreed to do so, or did he promise Papa Joe's (Jessica's father and also the movie producer) great profits? Hopefully he now knows better than signing on another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor. I hate the painful appearance of his face as he suffers from the bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous commentator giving this movie is 8 out of 10. either involved in the movie or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would find this movie enchanting. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe buy some plays?
