I found Horrorvision almost uncompromising. While I was only 70 minutes long, I still got myself the fast forward button. The acting was of the "if I scream and say I'm very intense" school. And the story was at best a scenario that still had to be dropped. <br /> <br /> While I never go to the Full Moon for the big movie, I've never seen them produce such a mess.
