I bought this movie for $ 5 in a bargain at my local video store for just one reason, Chase Masterson, but I had to crumble the five, throw it in a toilet and flush it. The movie is about a bunch of twenty somethings that have reached high school and reunited on the commemoration of their idiot friends, who got drunk and wandered into the forest and died. There is the problem that a reptile monster is pursuing them one by one. The acting is uncomfortable, these worthless people apparently appeared on performances like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The directing was equivalent to a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. The people here who praised this film are, of course, friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this stack of garbage at ALL costs.
