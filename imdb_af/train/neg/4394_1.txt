The John Goodman program was pretty awful, but this thing just looks quiet. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who had memories of childhood rebellion, but has never gained adult perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world inhabited by these characters. Everyone is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable, but the show stretches from one inexplicable, unrelated scene to another in such a senseless way, it's not fun to watch it. Worst, no one in the production crew has ever seen snow!
