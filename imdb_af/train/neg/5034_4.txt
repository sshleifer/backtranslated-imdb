I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this movie and some of the reviews that should be positive. I saw the movie and was disappointed. I didn't find it very pleasant at all. It was slow and didn't have the entertainment value. Even the murder tones are dark, with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all. And the supposed big turning end is really not much, I saw it, and then the end was just cliche. This movie may not be called much, but by the little thing it gets it is overestimated. I would not recommend this movie.
