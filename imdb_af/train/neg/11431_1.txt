It is important not to be insulted by a lack of logic or common sense and those who have a gray matter will agree that this movie just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The problems lie in the direction, choices and lack of depth in the character building. The word comedy was very difficult to say when I expected to laugh when using these words. Let's look at the problems in direction / writing. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister, both in their mid 30's, look well-adjusted. They meet a stranger at a park and the character of Heather Graham walks to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half a healthy person would run the other way or at least shout for a police officer. He then walks awkwardly and makes dumb statements and falls to him. Then after ONE date, they all went out together, he fell in love with her and decided to get married in Vegas within a week? Hello does anyone feel stupid? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words we see on the screen and he wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it didn't make sense. Sure it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now, Heather also falls on her with hair and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very shallow character) kiss or more to the point, it was the saddest kiss ever that chemistry can be there. I found it to be irresponsible and unfunny and while many say Heather can't act I think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> It was Sue Kramer's debut director and for me it was just too much for her to chew. It will take a lot of craft to make this filmwork and IMHO can do it with better writers and casting and direction.
