One may wish that an idea that works as well as the "invisible man" will work better and be treated more carefully in the era of fantastic special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters and finally the entire 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a crazy scientific movie of the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the incredible special effects and the idea of ​​an invisible man bumping the streets. But unfortunately, we are soon back in the concise delivery of the underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the movie is not only predictable, but schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of parents movies or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But for every movie it becomes clear and clear that the idea of ​​oil classics under the nose of eager malicious people like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is very bad. Obviously the money here is the key issue: the time and energy put into writing is nowhere near enough, and as a result, "Hollow Man" is severely undermined by clichés, juicy characters, predictability and lack of any depth . <br /> <br /> But the one thing that really impressed me was the curse beside the special effects. When making these kind of films, modern producers are very eager to allow children to see them. That is why the language (and sometimes the violence and sex) is much tinted. When the whole world blows up, the good guys are going "Oh darn!" and "oh my god". "Hollow Man" devours that kind of hypocrisy and the characters have the freedom to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying the most natural response to something went wrong - but it makes it more credible if someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for this.
