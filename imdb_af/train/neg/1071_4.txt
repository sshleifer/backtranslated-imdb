A very poor movie, mainly due to a bad story, but also poor in the case of Robert Downey Jr. act, and irrational behavior by many characters. If you are someone who likes to eliminate your thoughts and just watch a movie for its creativity or acting criteria, then you may like this movie. Personally, I can't do it with a drama and found it too far-fetched. <br /> <br /> I am especially irritated as a main character, supposed to be an intelligent person, constantly as a complete work minded. In this movie, if the main character was the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> The first highly unlikely action is when the main character, a successful lawyer Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves a party and happens on a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, shouting that her car was stolen. They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm, forcing him to accept a riding house. <br /> <br /> She tells him of her strange dad who is a kind of strange sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at her dilapidated cabin in the poorer part of town, they see that her car is in the driveway. The house lights were also on and some objects in the house were broken. Things are very strange, she's weird (looks like a tramp, she pulls out in front of him until she's completely naked? Yes!). Also, the father's strange, the house is a wreck - everything had to be said to Magruder: "Hi, it's too strange for me, I'm out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by her story and sex, she takes the effort to make her father dedicated. Everything screams off! <br /> <br /> Then the top-flight lawyer is that he is, he arrives late at the office with the same shirt he had the previous night. (The fact that all women are in the office notice.) It is likely that a successful lawyer like a 16 Magruder has upset the police in some cases, and when he goes to the police, he claims the father is terrorizing them , the police ignore him. not at all! <br /> <br /> It's just too unlikely.
