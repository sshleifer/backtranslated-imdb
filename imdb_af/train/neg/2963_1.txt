Since I visited this site and chose for movies, I have never given a movie of 1. Even the disturbing "Dance! Workout with Barbie" has a 2. There is a reason for this. <br /> <Every time I see myself thinking a very bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the question: "Is this movie really as bad as the horrible soul-sucking animal that" Theodore Rex " is? "And I have never answered" yes ". <br /> <br /> I will give anything within the reason to know which cartilage said: "Hey! Let's remember" Blade Runner "with Barney in the Harrison Ford role!" And decided it was a good idea to actually spend time and money connecting it to film. Furthermore, I want to know what the hell kind of market they would sell to sell it if it wasn't stripped of video. This is the rare monster: a movie that is too violent for kids and foolish for adults. I will ask, "What did they think?" but in this case it can be superfluous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is to expose yourself to this monstrosity if you are one of five or six racial fans of "Howard the Duck" or if you are curious to to see the most Evil Insane movie of all time, or you really want to punish yourself.
