As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich I had to (finally) see this very, dull photo. This is Mrs. Dietrich's first color film, and the world's most beautiful blonde is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous drill, in which a subject that is self-inflicted, performs me rigorously: religious guilt. (Who needs this?). Maybe it's all of Dietrich's films (and I've seen the most, including "Pittsburgh"). This is the only one where even her performance is hardly worth watching. The color photography is OK (it's a very early Technicolor release), but no purpose. Ridiculous cast: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (said enough?). The only thing of any interest is John Carradine's alien caricature of action as "The Sand Diviner," which predicts everything to be predicted. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ones ever imagined. Another example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a very good movie? - except that one?) And for one last annoyance, the MGM DVD soundtrack is a mess, with volume levels seemingly random. Very untouched.
