My wife and I found this movie very unsatisfactory. While the plot is interested and busy just wondering what's going on, when you leave the theater, there are just too many loose points that don't make sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, very wealthy head of a NY bank, has a horrible hidden secret. Profit from World War II deals with the Nazis and hiding a prey stolen from Jews. He holds the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he never wants to reveal it, why didn't he burn and destroy the documents years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously he doesn't need it - why do they prefer to have them? How did the bank robbers get his secret? How did they know about this very safe # 232? Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records showing SD Boxes No's 231 and 233, but no # 232. Curious. He somehow found time to do an exhaustive search of bank records to discover this one odd fact. All the time with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatens to briefly start executing them. Wow! Talk about superpowers for a detective. <br /> <br /> The bankers loose millions of dollars in loose currency in the safe they opened. They only take the contents of SD Box # 232, apparently for the purpose of renouncing the bank president. It disregards any rational effort with a logical explanation for what the film portrays as a criminal master brain, or for its minors with less brain. <br /> <br /> Using her political ties with the Mayor of NYC, Jodie Foster gets permission to enter the bank under the control of the bank robberies while holding hostages. She offers the chief bank robber an agreement to buy back the documents he now has in hand, but he is not interested. My wife was insulted by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (Ace Detective) and Jodie Foster, having troubled problems. shoot for high-powered problems. <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster movie I saw, "Flight Plan," was also hit with holes that didn't make sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I would probably avoid her future movies. <br /> <br /> Now, my problem is that I rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies. I can't differ with this one ... "A WASTE OF MONEY AND A WASTE OF TIME." Be warned. A well-crafted film, fine actors, lousy script writing.
