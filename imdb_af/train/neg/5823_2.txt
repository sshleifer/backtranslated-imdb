"Drawing Restriction 9" is a kind of movie you love or hate; Fortunately or not, I left it with a strong sense of wasted time and being filled with the "killing of whales is bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the movie may be pleasurable, especially the first half, until it is clear that every poem portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whaling. Until then, it might be almost amusing to look at the daily tasks of Japanese workers, but later it becomes clear that anything appearing on the screen is a propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the movie basically uses the old morality game, where "good" and "bad" are not distracted in the course of action, but set in stone. It's probably just me, but I find such a kind of art level and preoccupied, even when it comes to the striving to protect the environment (no sarcasm here). According to me, it is a cardinal sin when a film material is stretched without justification for the sake of stretching. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could easily fit in 75 minutes, but has a bad length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there was not enough to leave 15 minutes of gaps of nothing without notice. The film has no standard scenario, and there is no evolution of characters, but it is not a documentary, rather a kind of conceptual installation. This is an unusual movie, but it can still be considered art, even if the concept is as simple and naive as it is here. OTOH I also believe that the director should be honest and not pretend that it can only be delivered in less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the music score looks mostly whale sounds. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
