I found it a good movie to pass your time, but not with any historical value. The portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The turn of the facts is ... funny! She gave birth while she fed her people!?!? Oh please ... A pregnant Queen of Egypt (especially this one) won't bother going from one room to another! They tried to make her look like a saint to God! And the way they tried to justify her to kill her own sister ... beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were anything but her feelings and morals. She did everything for just two reasons: Power and self-preservation! She was brought into a family where she had to survive, something she did very well. Anything that stood on her way was murdered (her brothers and sisters) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill and also ... gay to be seduced. So, he was her end ...
