There is no spoil in this review. There is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; Most track programs at least try to tie the cuts into the plot by a little stretch, but it didn't even do it. Tracks, three lines to guide to the next unlimited sequence of dull clips ... OK, so maybe they were short on production time, but they would have been better off completely beating this episode. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it really made it. Scrubs are usually much better at suppressing tropics, but somehow it has gone through .... <br /> <br /> Thanks for being in the next episode.
