Who wrote it? Some guy named John Cohen. I think it was the first script he'd ever worked on. Someone has to tell him to write a dialogue that looks like something someone can actually say. <br /> <br /> Who directed it? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut was falling far from the tree. Someone may have told you that you can actually shoot a scene in a taxi in New York, and it will really look like you won't have to do it with a blue screen. Maybe he wanted to let him know that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he learned that lesson. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she plays in this movie. Oh, wait, it's been produced by her dad. Okay, that's why she has the part. It's actually the only reason I can think. <br /> <br /> So should I be surprised that it's bad? No. Should I be surprised at how bad it is? I think many would have if they saw so much of it as I did. I mean you're expecting a movie with Jessica Simpson to be bad, but it's ... it's not just bad, it's the opposite of a classic movie. Think of a good Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as the movie is good. This is the Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it. I didn't watch ten minutes anymore, because I couldn't go on. No doubt I would have walked out of the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per scene actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The movie starts off badly, and then it is about to become so bad, it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first action ends, you realize it will only get worse, and that is when you have to leave or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film falls under the category of being so bad, it should be used in place of water board at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer to enter the water.
