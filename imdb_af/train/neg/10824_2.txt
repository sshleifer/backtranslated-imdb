This version is pretty unsatisfactory, I'm scared. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has since childhood, but William Hurt's tired, discarded play style is totally inappropriate for the brave passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, thriving teenager who's hurting dental tires! I also can't believe they have eliminated Edward's great end-of-book marriage proposal, one of the most moving moments in literature. I appreciate that they finally used such a young, simple woman to play Jane, a character supposed to be a secular 18. However, if you want to see a version approaching the personality and passions of the novel, please see the 70's version with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and beautiful to play Jane, but nobody touched Rochester's character as Scott did.
