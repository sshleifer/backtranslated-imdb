Rob Schneider is a well-known comedian cause of his movements, faces and performances of "not humans". This time he is the animal. Marvin is a loser trying to be a hero and someday, no one calls a man being attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the crime scene, he is stuck with his car and is really damaged. He does not remember what happens and on the next normal day his life is not the same as finding out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we had our wife that our main character is trying to reach, but his ordeal is useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character is the destination if I can use this metaphor. Marvin must find out how to become a normal person again. By the way, his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The movie is so unreal that it gets stupid in a few moments, but it is one of those movies, called senseless fun as I wrote above. So watch the monkey style Rob Schneider, but it's certainly not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best films that Schneider appears. He's a good comedian, but it's not his best movie.
