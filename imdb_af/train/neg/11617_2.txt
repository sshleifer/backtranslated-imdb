This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and straightforwardly useless. It actually makes me think there are people who would like to enjoy it. Without giving the story, it's about a young boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. During the whole of this movie, the viewer becomes subject to some of the most disturbing children's behavior imaginable. At the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruit of pure evil in the hands of a child no less, which provoked a whole group of dumb adults. There is no salvation, no righteousness, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on. Frankly, I didn't enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who enjoy horror movies, this movie may be too much. In spite of the fact that this movie performed well, the story itself is so disturbing that it seems to be equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist's waiting room in anticipation of a painful dental procedure.
