I wanted to keep this movie, but got bored and became incredible. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot that moves to a bomb and is, of course, shaky. But then, the rest of the movie remains in the shakycam mode, even at silent moments to the point of ridicule. Did the rental houses come from tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot at 16mm does not help, as the whole movie is grainy and shaky. <br /> <br /> For all the trouble Bigelow puts in accurate vehicles and equipment, there are plenty of bugs and inconsistencies that undermine the film's credibility. <br /> <br /> - A car will not burst into a single shot in flames, and once engulfed will not be eliminated by a small hand extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee will not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but will be backed by other vehicles in case of interruption or attack. - It will be extremely unlikely to hit a long-standing runner, where the bullet takes a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I believe bombs were brought to designated areas on or near a base, not a random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The oil tanker attack is said to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly safe area that has experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, but it is portrayed as a dangerous war of dark streets and mourning rebels. Strangely, James never gets into trouble for the ridiculous tactics of ordering his two companions to take each one a pavement, creating the kidnapping attempt. <br /> <br /> - What is the 3-man team always portrayed to clean buildings, uprisings, etc. on their own, even if there are clear soldiers right there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to go to a dead rebellious protruding window to find out that it doesn't expire? <br /> <br /> There were no solid shots around the viewer as to the size and layout of the base or where Baghdad was in proportion. I had no idea who the EOD team reported, and no other characters fell out. These are the things the characters will know, so we should. <br /> <br /> Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it goes without saying that the psychiatrist colonel will be in trouble with the Iraqis he is trying to move, that the choice of grain at home will be overwhelming and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. br /> <br /> Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the start has an upset relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. He is exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? <br /> <br /> If it is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war films, it is a pity. Just based on the half-hour I saw, I'd rather recommend Generation Kill on HBO.
