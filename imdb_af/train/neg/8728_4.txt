This one is bad. A very bad and boring crime film that has nothing out of the ordinary in it. A series of crimes, the killer that you don't see throughout the movie, the classic investigations. And also the classic story of a police spokesman finding out what's going on and not believed by anyone, so he must fight to reveal the truth himself. Not too much in this one. Vote: 4 out of 10.
