Who's joking about this? There was just too much in this movie that was difficult to digest. From when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unwittingly wants death on his father when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) in London to leave him minutes later. The only problem with that theory is that anyone who ever passed London Heathrow knows that such a fÃªte would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an Indian. But the movie problems don't end there, there is the issue of the two main leaders (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) who are about to reach their dreams as rock stars. I mean yes, we've seen success Boyle's success (a woman in the UK who reaches her dreams after the age of 50), but it was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my unbelief because I felt that throwing Salman and Ajay was just weak. They will never throw Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi the same roles, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men well in their 40s) trying to desperately try to keep their 20s? Let's not even talk about the most self-conscious actress on the screen today, Asin. It's her second movie (which I saw) and she's just hopeless as an actress, so aware of her that she's just worried about looking good for the camera, rather than giving a good acting. It's just hard to believe that she has turned all those other scrolls to die in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress, nothing to write about the house. And on top of that, the movie just dragged it annoyingly. There is nothing special about it, trust me that you will predict every click thing that will happen to it.
