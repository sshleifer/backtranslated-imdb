Oh me, where to start ... this movie was just awful. Writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it makes me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but definitely didn't get it! I thought it would be decent enough, since I'm not picky. I watched several bad horror movies. In fact, it's my goal to see all horror movies, no matter how terrible they are. At one point in the film I commented on the "corn syrup" and in the special features they actually acknowledged that it was Karo syrup (Maize Leaf Syrup ...). The movie has all the necessary things for a horror movie (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid moves), but it just didn't lack anything to make it really good. The author must also take classes or just give up!
