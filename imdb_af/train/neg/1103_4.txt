As a young black / latina woman, I always look for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie at the videobusiness, I thought I'd enjoy it; Unfortunately I didn't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story is simply not properly developed. The movie has just been dragged on and many of the characters appearing on the screen come without much to contribute to the overall movie. If the director did a better job connecting the screens, I might have enjoyed it a little more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" any day. I just wasn't too impressed.
