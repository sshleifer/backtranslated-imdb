This movie really, I mean REALLY, sucks. It has plot holes so big, and 30 feet of dragon can fit through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image ever on the film. I mean, if you see such a thing, you must think, "Wow, somebody actually made this movie. Then he released it. Whatever he is, be sure they are no longer working in the movie business. <Br / > <br /> When I rented this movie, it wasn't on DVD, so I (reluctantly) pulled it out on video, the first thing to appear was a Lord of the Rings trailer, for the Two Towers "It was a very clever move to put this trailer on the video. It justifies me (reluctantly) to give the movie 1 star, otherwise I would have given it zero stars. Perhaps the producers though Dean's star account Cain (I think that's how you play it) in the crowd (including the video store it is). <br /> <br /> Next they used split screen technique as in Hulk) to (suppose) compensate for what a horror this piece of crap is, and on the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon. rt, or isn't it? Anyway, the dragon in the movie looks like a rejection of Gremlins 2, and has the CGI of a Nintendo video villain from the early 90's (maybe worse). Nor the Dragons movement as it pursues its victims - she is the same monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg left, stupid, stupid, stupid DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! It just pisses me off. Perhaps the filmmakers thought it was exciting and would have the same effect of Jaws. Why not, then you shot a Dragon POV. Anyway, it was just funny, like a weebl show. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives a couple of confusing appearances during the film (perhaps he thinks this movie can end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was an add-on for a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it's so bad, my 5-year-old brother can come up better. those when he unwittingly tries to lie about why he breaks in my room while I wasn't there. Oh, and did I mention that I F @ # KING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS INDEPENDENT STUPIDE CROSS NEW MOVIE? !!!
