This film breaks the fine line between satire and silliness. While a bridge system that has no rules can promote marital justice, it certainly cannot promote a winning bridge, so the satire didn't work for me. But there were some nice things, especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It's handled like a championship boxing match. Not only has the arena been cut down for the game in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee floating between the contestants, and the radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns is delivering unceasing complaints about the events. At one point he even counted "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if a four-diamond bid was a knock-out opportunity. And people were all tied to them, a common championship boxing event. That spoof indeed worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy needed to maintain the intended satire. Paul Lukas does not have much flair for comedy and is displeased; beautiful Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh are not good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic twist as a forgetful blonde at the start of the movie, but she disappears almost afterwards. What a waste of talent!
