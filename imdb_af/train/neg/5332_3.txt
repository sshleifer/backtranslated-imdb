OK, portraying the stereotypical 'Indians' in this story is simply not wrong. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the movie. I thought, okay ... he was never so tan in real life. It's the obvious brown 'Indian' make-up I've ever seen. It's just as bad as the 'Indians' at 'F-Troop' and the old Hollywood westerners who were played by Jewish and Italian American actors and not true Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is ok but usually lam story and mediocre songs, like in all Elvis's later films. He just did them because Colonel Parker tied him to long-term movie deals to print as much money from Elvis as possible! I kept thinking "thank God" that Elvis stopped making movies forever after this movie came out. It's cool to see character actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, though. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's 'Indian' makeup is absolutely AWFUL. It's the worst of the bunch. What do the filmmakers think? Was Mr. Meredith this one just for the money or what? However, I like some Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even see his movie with future TV co-star Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change Of Habit' in which Elvis plays an inner doctor. <br /> <br /> At least, Elvis made some good movies, but the mediocre and bad overwhelmed the decent and good. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you very much, thank you!
