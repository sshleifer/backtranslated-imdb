The story is similar to ET: An outside race around the earth and trying to get back home. While staying on our planet, it will create friendly relationships with people. <br /> <br /> But unlike ET that radiates drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It is indeed a pure Dysney production: his core is heard children and the film is more in the visual than in the message. <br /> <br /> So, you'll find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the town, a "cosmic" lattice) and the castings being experimented with, with special reference to "Doc", which is rejuvenating. in a "Mac Fly" character, and Hurley, looking open for self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Ice Cream on the Cake: Danny Elfman, the capital letter, and like every other great composer, recognizes his "voice" before being even credited.
