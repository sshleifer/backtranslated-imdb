It can be one of the nicest movies ever if you don't take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it's so nice. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and the crabs are Japanese. It's incredibly bad. And the end, which has been engraved by the entire movie, is incredibly amazing. Predictable, but to see the final battle will roll you into your seat. Don't even give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is nice to look at and yes, she looks naked. Her daughter is not quite worth doing, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. It's a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7. Did I mention that there are huge crabs?
