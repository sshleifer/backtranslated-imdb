Wow ... speechless about making this movie, I can't say much. The box at the local video store had to say it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses getting lost on Scream's set and deciding to shoot a movie! <br /> <br /> Apparently, the play wasn't in the budget, but they could afford nudity and well-acted actors! Fabric style almost makes a point here, except that most of these acting class competitions do not forget that there is a plot to go somewhere when reading this script. After only 4 or 5 have been killed by the so-called masked killer and a confusing plot about a murder club who considers the dumbbell, a real club she can join (only if she can bump over a girl in her bump car ), you want your hands stuck with the closest sharp object to remind yourself never to get too excited by a possibly good movie like this. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought this movie and can't find anyone to get it out of their hands. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases, without keeping in mind. Throw it away if you bought it.
