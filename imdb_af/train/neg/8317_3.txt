For a movie about a killer, it is surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens and even when things happen, they don't generate real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> The play is good of the two leads, Cassetti delivers in particular a good performance combining the security and stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the team also do what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that Succo as a true story is not interesting is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> Movies of this kind usually try to generate tension or empathy or indignation and it generates nothing but a sense of regret that you are wasting your time to see it.
