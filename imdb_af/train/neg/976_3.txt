I am generally more willing to be open about rom coms than many, but it was simply not a very good effort. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - did not see, and I doubt. It has a lot to do with a winding plot, a lack of chemistry between clues and a divine performance / character of his alleged male lead (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon walks on the screen wearing the clothes and hairdresser of 15 years old and younger than that. He is supposed to be a teacher you see and of course it is well known that the school divides the world into love to hire individuals less adults than the children they pretend to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I doubt if any actor could make him enjoyable, but old reliable ones like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might shoot it. Not Fallon, who's not funny, nor an actor, but seems to think he's both. Not once in the whole movie do you believe Fallon in his role or believe there is any way these two people belong or will be together. By the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual, but couldn't carry this one alone - it's difficult to have a single romance), tells Fallon that she's over, too much happened, and she moved up. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you actively activate her. At last she did what she had to do months ago. But of course the plot mechanics will not allow it to end (an end that could actually make a statement out of this mess), and instead we see the rational career moving it all away to chase this childish idiot and encourage his fraud. It was, of course, meant to be good and satisfying, but it actually scared me more than anything else.
