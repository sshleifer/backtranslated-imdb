I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I meant to see how terrible it was, but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how terrible it was. I couldn't think of the scary attention this movie was doing. After I have seen it, I can understand it. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that this movie is not without some cool shots. There is a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters die in this movie is so cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, hell would have thrown Tara Reid straight, as she is so incredibly horrible in this movie, it is unthinkable. And of all the roles she plays a curator. Now if she's playing a stupid, empty head, maybe I can forgive her for treating her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, though he seemed to think that if she pulled her shirt down in the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize that she had made her in the middle of the movie at the wrong moment, but the movie was even more hilariously bad. And is it a Mexican song or something that happens during the dry humping scene? I couldn't tell. <br /> <br /> What brings me to my next complaint: Your Boll shows some of the worst government skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I give House of the Dead an F (and I only do it for very little movies), but HotD will at least get a B compared to this piece of junk. The movie starts with a very, very long story that causes immediate confusion (and read by a terrible narrator) and from there the cuts are really stupid. There is this one point where Slater and Reid look around a building that has been destroyed and obscure the screen. When it comes back, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly an entire army joined them. Huh? <br /> <br /> And someone didn't check the errors in this movie. At one point a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings link colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater's away from a dead comrade, you can see her getting up. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, I was really lost. Something about an old tribe that releases darkness and someone "opens the way" or something and all the evil monsters jump out. It's just an excuse to have many rifle styles (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to be recharged in this movie), which simply, USE. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie and hope to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
