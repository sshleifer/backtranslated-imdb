Why did I relax 1.5 hours of my life to watch it? Why was this movie even made? Why do I even say about this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said this movie took patience to watch and it wasn't for everyone. I can't figure out who this movie is. Perhaps, after a hit of acid has dried, some people can see and make sense. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's simple and simple rubbish. The movie doesn't follow any plot line whatsoever, just if you think you have something, well ..... you don't. <br /> <br /> I think the end has some finality to the movie (no pun intended), the viewer gets a glimpse of what might be going on. I don't think I'm putting a spoiler here, not that it matters. This movie is another must miss in the world of filmdom.
