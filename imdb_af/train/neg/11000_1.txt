Words cannot describe how completely abysmal this film is. It is a series of random, unfit tracks about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy who gets it with an old, deadly woman (REALLY disturbing). The only entertaining thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. Also, it is designated NC-17, avoiding the only people who can tolerate it.
