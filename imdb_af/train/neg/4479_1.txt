I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not then it's VERY close. Ever seen a bad teen soap opera. Well, it's like one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLE SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Everything we need is here. <br /> <br /> Girl: But I want to take myself somewhere else. br /> ou: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> To reach this line, they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the personality of the characters and events. In addition, they are just getting rid of things. The movie also ends before the book is finished. This is an AWFUL movie. So, if you didn't read the book, don't look. When you read the book, it burns (the movie). If you like stupid teenage sea puppies that are lower in quality than your average low quality teen soap opera, go. Then we have to expect something other than MTV?
