First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas can never be regarded as a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just mean. In this piece of @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater, the movie industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnamese veterinarian named Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a band and then some you can believe if he kicks a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and them on the floor) get word that his family was murdered and his sister kidnapped. That's why he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Has some potential, but still thin to start. <br /> <br /> Now, the acting. To be myself an actor, I am qualified to say that it was of the WORSTS in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is good, itself. The jackasses that reject the Clampets / Deliverance must be pushed up and shot for their so-called offensive actions for actors everywhere, especially talented people who never get their big break! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. The gunfire is so good at BEST, and the fist fight is deplorable. I saw more sincere fights at the Renaissance festival (and that was pretty much progeny)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: Avoid this aspect of CACA at all costs! IF THIS IS THE SINGLE FILM IN, DO YOU WANT TO AVOID IT! For your brain cell count, DO NOT look at this thing!
