Somewhere in this movie is a half-hour episode of The Twilight Zone trying to get out. While Cube was stiff, good-natured, claustrophobic and intellectual, I'm scared Cypher is a bloated, boring rehash of several well-behaved themes that just don't add up much, especially if you've seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to completely drag through his relatively short 95 minutes to the incompetent end. None of the characters spark each other, and for a movie made in 2002, technology is really cheesy. It is difficult to join this tired and uninspired movie with Cube's director. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good one. <br /> <br /> Looking at the grass and getting dry and getting bored of your stick insects, first look at this movie, but the other activities will probably be more stimulating.
