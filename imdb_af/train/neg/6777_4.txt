While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really didn't like this movie, although it had so many similarities. Both were just a few years apart, both Cary Grant stars and both were World War II comedies. The overall tone and style of the movies, however, was quite different. KISS HERE FOR ME, in general, just looked like a cheaper movie - with poor writing, little energy and some very broad performances - even compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least a lot of the blame lies in the decisive Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her generous talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget movie look like it was coming from a 3-star studio. Plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy to connect with Cary Grant - an actor usually loved his grace and class. It's like linking Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
