This film had so much promise. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, it was at its best laugh, in the worst case. The acting styles have transformed the spectrum of really, really flat (the angels, the wife and the daughter) (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to convey information to the audience, rather than trying to talk to real people. Pay special attention to the "bug" scene. This is an insult to the audience's ability to find things. In defense of the scene, however, it has become the greatest role of the whole movie. I read that they spent a lot of money on several overseas places. Too bad they didn't use it. I didn't feel like I was being transported to exotic places. Anyone can put stock image of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to end up on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics displayed on the decoding computers. This is my opinion (and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor had been much lower and the Action Factor would have increased substantially, this movie would have been good.
