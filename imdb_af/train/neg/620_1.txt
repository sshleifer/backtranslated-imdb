I didn't see it too long, and I have to say: This movie is terrible. I watch crappy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredible corncream that uses scary words while killing its victims (actually worse than the one in this sentence). He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his murder. "Everyone picks me up. The only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer trash likes one of the guys who choose me. I want to kill everyone." OK, I'm exaggerating. But the premise for this movie alone is enough to put it at the bottom of the crappy movie list. <br /> <br /> Adding to what I just said is the child's mother debauchery, he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend gets it on, mom's boyfriend tells him to go, refuses child, and insists that he should not leave his own home. Boyfriend chasing child in wheat field. He murdered child just before mother, mother screaming in fright, boyfriend is like, "OMG! I didn't mean it!" Then he told her mother nothing to say about it. However, Kid was killed under a scarecrow. So, like a child murdered under a scarecrow, he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a revenge. His victims "have not been beaten so much" (Scarecrow's official tagline) <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie is filmed in 8 days. That's right, 8 days. I would give this movie a 2 because it has at least one or two reasoning moments. (They're spoiling, so I won't spoil it if you actually want to see this crap.) I could have forgotten the bad acting, the terrible special effects, the deadly writing and the bad camera, but I simply have no respect. for the lack of effort at that level. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't nearly as good as I do it. If you want to preview how to make a movie, or if you like to watch bad movies, like me, watch it at your own risk. Everyone should stay safe from this movie at all times.
