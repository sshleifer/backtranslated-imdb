This movie was so bad that I couldn't sit through it without doing anything else. There was no plot and no point. I was thoroughly bored and for a movie about a rising comedian I couldn't recall a joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charism speak technical jargon cannot be less entertained. <br /> <br /> So how was it made? Is there no quality control in film? Looking at the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who has become popular and appeared in fine comedies, could survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny in this movie, so it proves that writing is so important in effective comedy.
