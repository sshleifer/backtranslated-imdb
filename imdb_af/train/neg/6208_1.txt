There is only one word for this movie. Awful. The director clearly has talent, but like his character, Robert Carmichael, he throws everything away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray he can't bother to use it. Being pulled into small crime and then descending into depression is Cray's vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids, this film depicts young people without aspirations or respect. Cray calls for attention, but deserves no one. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to move into the faces of the audience. He assumes that the audience is ignorant of world horrors. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall, he shows our male depravity with adolescent tile. <br /> <br /> Some movie players have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short appearances. The acting is otherwise amateur, young men Joe and Ben are making. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive woman of celebration chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); How she could have subjected herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. The film is never subtle and Monica is treated to the most free of charge warfare action. War images are used to give the idea that young men cannot help themselves, and acts of violence in even "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and is symptomatic of our changing society where men have an increasingly less important position, but Cray falls to the level of barbarous men he wants to uncover through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film do not offer any relief. They are either victims or in Manville's case, a maimed mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> It's Cray's first movie. I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not relentless, he just has experience and his film shows his naivety. The film will be released later this year, but I hope the company will go bust because the public really doesn't need this kind of material.
