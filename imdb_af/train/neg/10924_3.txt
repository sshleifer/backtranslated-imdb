Watching the first 30 minutes of Sands or Oblivion gave me much hope. It looked like I was a cheaper version of the Mummy. The lineup was promising, in the 1920s Cecil B. Demille made her opus of the Ten Commandments. It appears in the use of genuine Egyptian artefacts for the film they unleashed an old and terrible evil (don't they always do?). Aware of what's unleashed DeMille recommends burying the whole set instead of the usual exercise to break it down. Hopefully the evil will be buried forever. Then we change to the current day where a team tries to dig out the site (the movie's first mistake, but hey, the costumes are expensive and it's a sci-fi channel film). The first sightings we get from the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that made an effort and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the bodies start. That's where the movie went south for me. The reaction to the fact that people die in horrible and weird ways gets a weirdly muted response. Once they realize that the old wickedness is once again unleashed and on a deadly spree, what is the stock issue that the leading man and woman do? They make the usual stop for the "man who knows the truth but never tells anyone". After receiving the important information, do they share it with the comrades at the digging site? No, they stop at a hotel for a refreshing shower and a fun little talk. I'm really not the most motivated person, but if I knew that a devil was from ancient Egypt, everyone would lose sight and kill me. I'll put a little haste in my step to solve the problem. After this long and senseless middle section, they get the Anubis monster in the usual way to destroy, by hovering around in dune buggy and shooting it with a rocket rider while standing through a heap of phosphor grenades. For a Sci-Fi movie, it was above the ordinary crap that they carried, which didn't say much at all. What disappointed me is that it could have been much more if someone wrote a proper script for it.
