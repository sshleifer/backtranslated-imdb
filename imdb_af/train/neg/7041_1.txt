What else can you say about this movie, except it's very awful. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons to see it, but it is, but their talents are being wasted in this junk. I think they have a double in some of Adam's scenes, like when he runs because you can't see his face. If Adam was embarrassed to be in the Zombie Nightmare, just think what he should feel about this in this? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but Zombie Nightmare is still a classic (first look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and last) compared to this one. The gang is very annoying and overworked by some of the actors. A Rip-off of The Wild One with Marlon Brando, of course. Tina looks incredible. I hope she and Adam have a good salary !! Pass!
