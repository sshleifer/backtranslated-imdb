I saw this move a few years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival when I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most people shoot this movie, because the movie sounded together (through the filmmaker's own recording on the official website - the short one was shown as a "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But nevertheless, it was an easy comedy. I think many people try to read too much in a comedy. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I just did it when I showed it. So it passed on that level. Just me 2 cents.
