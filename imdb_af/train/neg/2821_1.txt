I just saw this movie and it was enough for me. The movie has very little or no plot and is nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because it died Zoe Trilling of the second "Night of the Demons". and I wanted to see that she played someone normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper scripts are barely beginning and nowhere if Robert Englund dominates the movie and refreshes the landscape and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hide this movie!
