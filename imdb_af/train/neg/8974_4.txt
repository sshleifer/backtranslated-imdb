This movie, I don't call it a "movie", was basically about nothing and mostly worked for the popular acts of the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (pun intended), and this movie gave the troops and our audiences a surprise. <br /> <br /> But we have something with a little more content. <br /> <br /> Beloved to see a young Buddy Rich on the drums. the music was good throughout. <br /> <br /> But one comes after another getting old fast. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize Zero Mostel! so if you're one of the "greatest generation", as they say, you'll definitely enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
