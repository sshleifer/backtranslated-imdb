I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is here, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This movie contains six stories. It's a new concept that has flown from Hollywood. So it's not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and make a boyfriend interested in news reporters in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears, claiming to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she screams, I'm irritated. Salman Khan can't play comic roles. But in his serious parts he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He gets into a midlife crisis and is attracted to a much younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Of course, Anil Kapoor and Juhi are born actors / actresses. They are wonderful. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) marries Gia (Ayesha Takia) but gets cold feet and blows off the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (John Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She gets an accident and suffers from a memory loss. Now she doesn't know she loves her husband anymore. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a manager. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman in love with an Indian man, but marries an Indian woman. Raju must bring Staphani to the man, but fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda's movies. He is very irritating, not funny. But in this movie I liked him a lot, as he grew up in the past year. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to do serious action with her, but every time her family comes in. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not an attractive actor, but he is funny! I like his movies. <br /> <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make one story out of six, interesting stories don't make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but it is not meaningful to the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can't act! Leave that woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan has to make more movies, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan can not perform comic roles, but real serious movies. It was written as an actor on his life. This movie sucks and is a waste of good actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's just like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
