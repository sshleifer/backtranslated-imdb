Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny-it makes this movie in one word. What the crap was this thing, because it can kill me to use the word movie!?!?! I hope the director, writer and producer didn't mean it would be good, as it probably didn't! A scientist turned his son into a hammerhead shark and the shark killed a lot of people who invited the scientist to the island !!! O my Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it, I laughed at all the serious parts, because they were so stubborn and unprofessional .... and they couldn't have made the shark's body more unrealistic, even though This "thing" had a bit bigger budget than most low-budget movies. All I have to say is watch this movie expect to laugh at all the bad acting and stupid corny dialogue. Because if you expect a good movie, I'll be very disappointed.
