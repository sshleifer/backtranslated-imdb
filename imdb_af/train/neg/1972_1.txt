It really does not do the blues justice. It starts badly with images from the voyager sin and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Somebody blind anyway), apparently out of outer space (?) And tells us the life stories of various blues musicians. Corny as it is, it could be the visually interesting part of this documentary. After that, the only thing to see is that actors are incompetent to explore the classic songs, which are multiplied in the fake 20s black and white intersection with the Beck and Shemekia Copeland containers. It is a good device to show us why the old Blues groats were so real, but it doesn't make compelling to watch. There is almost nothing in it that justifies making it a movie and not playing a radio. No one should be forced to see these bad reenactments. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
