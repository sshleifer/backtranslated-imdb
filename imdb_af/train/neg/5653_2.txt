Let's put it that way. I actually get this movie. I get what the author / director is trying to do. I understand that the dialogue was meant to be dry and emotional. I understand that the plot is supposed to be non-climax and birthday. This is where the writer / director goes. A very very dry humor / comedy. With all that understanding, I still suck the movie. It seems as if the author / director Napolean Dynamite tried to recreate this movie. It had all the same features. Even the main character behaved similarly to Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. His writing worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me reformulate it. The only purpose is to snatch Napolean dynamite and try to capture that look. Too bad, it didn't work.
