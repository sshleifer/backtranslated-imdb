I chose this movie to replace the dull choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme-lethal villages. Well, for the past it's better than day television .... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It does have its points, but after about the first 20-30 minutes the good points have come out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a TV movie composed with not much time to make something that will keep together. In short, a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie. <br /> <br /> It has its marks, as the future is dirty, such as "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course, this is not a "Blade Runner". The captain looks like kind of actor Robert Forster, the kind of person you might want. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately it comes rather than a bad Andromeda rehash where the crew of the crew consists of poor copies of the clever shooters of "Aliens", the mystic is vampire Willow sexually reinforced, and the new Captain can be just like Jan-Michael Vincent walking on "Danger Island" in the Banana Split; he just put the uniform with the epaulette; he has very little right to it. All of them run around with their version of power lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'Eureka Maru', as they fight a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and in different tribes or sects of different evolutionary characteristics. ...... just like the Nietzcheans in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> It may have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he has taken part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but it didn't help the movie much. <br /> <br /> This is ..... "okay". Okay in the way someone can watch the DVD once without switching it off; If they see it with ads, they will probably change the channel. One can see it once .......... but a few hours later, wonder what it was that made them see. <br /> <br /> To me it was the femme fatale. ............ when she fought.
