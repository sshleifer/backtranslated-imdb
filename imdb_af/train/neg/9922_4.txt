Growing, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but I was even cold at this movie. For better and worse, the future is written off is not a simple "behind the music" style documentary. On the contrary, it is a biographical art film, a lot of interviews, performance images, home movies, and mostly pointless animated sketches that are being lifted from "Animal Farm". The film is coherent, but survives in half an hour. <br /> <br /> The campfire format, while keeping in mind, is actually quite annoying. First, without titles, it's hard to even know who half of these interrogators are. Secondly, who should really hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack's mouthpiece? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions did not add to his story. <br /> <br /> This photo is at its best when Strummer, through packed interviews and conversation, touches the facets of his life, most people didn't know about: the suicide of his older brother, with the killing his parents, the joy of fatherhood. For me it was most moving because it didn't show Joe Strummer as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular man who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life, we all had to face. <br /> <br /> There was better, more simple documentary about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and Kurt Loder's famous MTV Documentary of the early 90's occur.) Joe Strummer: The future is being written off, just for diehards.
