"Arahan" adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre. Comparing this confused movie with the inspired madness and quality of Stephen Chow's films, it's a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, the battle scenes are nothing new. All that is offered here has been done before and better by Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan's holders. Battles in Intelligent Motion Pictures require logic. There is no point in displaying blues that has no harmful effect than in the Matrix sequels. <br /> <br /> The handsome female head, So-Yi Yoon, captivated the screen, but she never made the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang so easily done in "House Of Flying Daggers". Having a background of Martial Arts works well in Kung Fu movies. Throwing actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in Asumi) unless you are a very talented director who proves as "Arahan" Seung-wan Ryoo.
