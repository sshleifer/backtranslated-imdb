This film can be judged from three points of view: as history, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as history. It calls it in the passing of the coup obliterated by Obote, the descent of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack as a backdrop, but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. <br /> <br /> As a profile of Amin, it might be interesting, as Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if it's a better movie, he'll get an Oscar. (He got it - which proves that the Oscar voters don't watch the movie they vote on.) It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which Amin and Uganda's history observed from the doctor's point of view. Rather, it tells the fictional story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story tells the one incident that Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there's no plot to keep it together. The beginning is stiff - it takes film freedoms with the novel, but sets the story up. The doctor's character is well-defined, but is lost in the second half of the movie that is suffering as a result. <br /> <br /> Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is badly explained - seduced by power? Why he's not with anyone is strange. The character of the friend in the novel is lost because the Scots have the case instead of the black doctor - a ridiculous entanglement that is not even believable, but leaves the authors of the film showing the anger of Amin. . The man named is a bit at the end. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Uganda drove on the left in 1971, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where is the Equator teeth? <br /> <br /> In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you might want to watch this movie for two hours to appreciate Forest Whitaker's play, but the last hour will lead to confusion. Knowing Uganda or reading the book doesn't see the movie - it'll just push you. And if you wanted to know why the doctor was so foolish, he wasn't.
