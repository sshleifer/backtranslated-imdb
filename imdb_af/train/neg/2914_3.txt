The title above is used to introduce the film "Gen" to his audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The movie starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While driving, we realize she's not as close as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she enters the hospital's garden, she sees the body of death of a patient. This is the start of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers go to hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they have to stay in hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather. All their communication with the outside world is also cut off. There is no way out! In those few days there will be more nasty murders. Now everyone suspects of each other. <br /> <br /> I think the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are, of course, positive sides of the movie. I really like the start of the movie. Especially when she goes to hospital and her first moments in hospital. Acts are okay. Some of them try too hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shock had to be spread through the movie. What I am saying is that it was a good turn, but instead of showing it off as a parody, we had to realize what was coming when we saw what was happening. The director had to explain everything I think didn't work well. Also, the most dangerous patient in the movie should be at least 48 years old, but she looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure he'll improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found out that he was only 21 years old. It made me feel more positive about him and his future movies. I'm not going to review this movie * from *****.
