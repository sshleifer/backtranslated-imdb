OK .. this movie could have been so good! All the generations were exposed to Thunderbirds and came to love it and this movie has some of the features one would find in a good Thunderbirds movie. The vessel itself and Tracey Island are realistically transferred to the big screen, while still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply fantastic, like Lady P and Bill Paxton, while not exactly who I intended Jeff Tracey was enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8-year-olds. can fly 200 tons of machines. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie around the kids that make me feel like Jonathon Frakes is hitting me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money Spending on the movie was the fact that Alan Tracey was so keen on the movie and he seemed to be able to fly the machines as well as his brothers ... at least 19/20. Seriously, these are a few beautiful simple machines to use if so. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't seem to be serious or dangerous. It tried to pay tribute while satirizing and it just fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady P)
