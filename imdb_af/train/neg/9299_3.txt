While watching this movie, I tried to figure out why they were bothering it. Although the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated / unnecessary subplots. The Hollywood marketing staff had to dictate the multiple bad guys, eternal double crosses and the man and woman who were getting too close and having sex. It's strange that we see more of them having sex than we did from the president and his mistress. The many sites and subplots make the film too wide and none of the characters are properly developed. I really didn't feel I knew any character except everyone was corrupt and angry. The end is completely incomplete - it left me more than just wanted, but what was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation as to why someone is doing what they do, except serving as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross. I am surprised that so many established (and good) actors have agreed to make such a hollow movie. It seemed as if a movie was made by college students working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you're in a movie class and want an example of what not to do is make a movie.
