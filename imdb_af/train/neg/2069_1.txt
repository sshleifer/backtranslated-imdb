I went to the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it was painful, but seeing Bret Carr in person was desperate at its peak. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was watching BC hit the face with a "C" battery. The jury is not yet here. It was a dildo and it was slow. Yep. <br /> <br /> "Shoot only the left side of the face ... people become famous by demanding!" - Bret Carr B. Carr drank a chicken pack for a little reverse psychology, which hit the streets of Clifton. He must. It's correct to bash the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt like this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, or clever enough to matter. It's the feeling you get from the Wat the Bleepesque drop of brainwashed, impressive neo-yuppies that see this Bret Carr work. <br /> <br /> This is an emotional drainage experience, just to think about writing this movie. , so goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
