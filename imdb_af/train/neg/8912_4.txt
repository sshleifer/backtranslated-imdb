Dark Rising is your typical bad, naturally fast-crafted horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It has a strange, inexplicable plot with holes so big that you can fit an elephant through them. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on, but it didn't really matter. It was a simple demon hunter who came back from the hell dimension to save campers' story, with confusing things added to witches and a book of evil. Plot elements and characters that do not make sense or completely disappear. The acting is bad, but honestly there is not much they can do with this script I guess. There are some topless scenes that are probably the only reason why this bad movie was made (like so many other bad movies). Give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on T.V.
