I went into this movie, expecting it to be really god-fearing. And it was. I was really sorry for the star-studded cast- Kathy Bates was a great actress ... before she made this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were as disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson couldn't do any of the fantastic shows I don't know and love her. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (including Vicer or Dibley celebrity), had about one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and across the place, and the humor was ... lacking. (However, there was one part of the movie where Santa entered the house of a Jewish family ... which made me laugh because their expressions were classic). See this movie unless your only alternative is a head-on collision with a train (actually, maybe the train will be better ...)
