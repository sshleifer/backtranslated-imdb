Although the production and Jerry Jameson's direction is definitive improvements, Airport'77 is not much better than '1975' airport: dirty, commercial garbage that gets thin Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packaged aircraft hijacked aircraft and crashing into the sea. All the publicity claimed it was near the Bermuda triangle, but nothing was mentioned in the film itself. When the rescue ships come to clear the plane out of the water, we see all their cranes (rather blindly) in the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (think of the taps that make the plane, the passengers and the waterless writer connected). NBC used to ring what was apparently the director's cut, injecting at least an hour of extra material - mostly flashing - into the proceedings with all the subtleties of a Gilligan's Island episode. The most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players have some fun: Lee Grant is a huge drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, a no-nonsense stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland thrive on parents. Yet, the personality conflicts and the turbulent military detail eventually tear up your patience. ** of ****
