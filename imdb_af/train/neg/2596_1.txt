Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to start ... then I waited for it to leave itself ... and when it didn't, I just sat down and stunned it: 1) It might be so be bad, and 2) I just wasted just a few hours on just stupidity. I had faith that Drew might not be able to make a movie ... and boy, have I ever lost my faith! Don't save this one! Drew tried, but the film was poorly written, poorly acted and only poorly conceived! I can't believe a script this bad ever got! It had a million chances to really do something about the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) And it never went! It's just a pity! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst, baffles me! Because believe me, if it gets worse, I would have torn my wrists before it was finished!
