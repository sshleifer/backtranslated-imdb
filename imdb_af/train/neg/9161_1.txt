... Well, pop it in the DVD, waste half an hour of your life you will never come back, and find out. <br /> <br /> Acting? What happens? <br /> <br /> Production values? ... Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> Story? Don't start me. <br /> <br /> After many years of posting on IMDb I never thought I'd see a movie so badly that I really wanted a lower rating than one. I always found at least a reason or two to see merit - even if only in the author's or director's, director's, cast's or the producer's intention? <br /> <br /> In this case, be all the same man (!) who really needs a deal, at least as evidenced by this worthless waste of video tape, that he has no talent. I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if it was a junior high school's "production" for his first cinema class, but the referenced "artist" behind this liquor was twenty-six at the time of miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How did it ever make? Who ever wrote a check for this in their right mind? In addition, don't let the box cheat you: there's not even anything that looks good on a good sex scene or a good "exposure" to that cover. <br /> <br /> Two final items: there was one second when this "movie" lost value: the aforementioned "talent" is being pushed by his lover. I'm glad! And I learned one thing about this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it is really really funny. But not in a comical way; it is just sad humorous. Very sad humorous.
