This is the worst piece I've seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is simply silly, dialogues don't make sense, humorous scenes have never heard the right humor. Actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. The writing itself is somewhat in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this movie, the battles. They are well choreographed as one would expect from the Hong Kong guys, and are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun. Although I believe the battles are just supposed to fill the empty space so the scriptwriter doesn't have to think about the storyline. However, this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from seeing it to the end. Avoid it unless you are a fan of the dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.
