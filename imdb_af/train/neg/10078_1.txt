Boy-love relationship / sequel with songs, this time only she is the punks and he is the straight arrow. Movie buffs out there really like this movie? It has supporters? I have to say, the mind rolls ... "Fat 2" is a real lame venture that doesn't even have the courage, moxy or pure gal to remind his predecessor's memory of flames (such as "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II "). No, it sneaks into slow motion and often just plays dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a big throw lost amid messy direction and unattended handling. It was the first time a significant audience had a look at Michelle Pfeiffer and although it did not make her embarrassed, it was worth the effort to forget. A burn on the lowest levels. NO stars from ****
