Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Introduce her to a friend's dinner, and comment on the deep political conversation that is taking place. People just look at her and say, "Oh, what would you know, you were Theodore Rex's star?" How can anyone take her seriously after she has dropped herself to be the star of this horrible piece of shit? Even small children will be horrified in this thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund And The Sea Monsters'. Actually, come to think, 'Sigmund' was much better than that. <br /> <br /> But did it? By having the producer an illegal substance before telling him about it? Look at this horrible horror at your own peril.
