The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, which are left unlike the other movie, made up of strange aliens. <br /> <br /> It's my belief that this movie is the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if anyone actually watched it. The plot is disconnected and, in many (far too many) cases, make absolutely no sense. The real wonder here is why in the world this successor was created to such an unsuccessful and terrible (but still somewhat better) movie. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy watching awesome movies for a good laugh.
