Oh, CGI. A blessing when used properly. A sin with it is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is badly used in this jaw version of Jaws. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has read any of my uploaded reviews has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low-budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a cute man in the low-budget movie, I will usually point it out. So, let's just get it out of the way. This is a low-budget horror movie I didn't like. The acting is for the most part horrible, effects ridiculous, and the script has the battlefield Earth as the worst I've seen this year. As far as the resident cute boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins that prize hands. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he's not just a toned body with beautiful eyes and a cute stump ... he can actually act (well, as much as he can in this angry movie). Now that we've got rid of the household chores, we continue. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here's the story (don't worry, I'll try to give away nothing) ... <br /> <br /> Traveling a Movie Staff to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers (established cute boy and his buddy) surfing with sharks. Unknown to them is a fairly large saltwater crocodile lying around the island. Croc comes up, follows chaos, and people are eaten. Roll end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie thrives a lot. It started well, but soon transferred to being stupid and stupid. A main character is lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining hero-one liners at the victim's expense. Also, if this crocodile is on top of the food chain on both the land and in the water, how about all the sharks? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, I don't think a few shady sharks will stay around. The FX is the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see. The CGI is terrible, and they even managed to screw the animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. The Croc Hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. You obviously have no reference to any of these judged by the monstrosity seen at the end of the film. And what about the pirate and drug bastard? Just need another reason to snatch a woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get small sub-genres in the movie world. With Alligator and it's sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now looks like "bulk crocodile / alligator" movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
