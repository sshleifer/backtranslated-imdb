With such a title you know you get a lot of junk. Acting bad. Script bad. Director bad. Grammar bad. <br /> <br /> Movie makes a lot of noise that really doesn't scream music and many people. Movie makes bad racial stereotype. Why does every movie come with a black hero with drug addict? Why should hero always dance as a success? Why does famous rapper always come into dance movie? Why shouldn't the letter 's' be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs to listen dumb down and make film that people with brains know how to speak proper English. <br /> <br /> Do self-esteem and don't see.
