Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise, but I've seen Europe '51 as one of the most overwhelming (and therefore annoying) movies I've ever seen. The film is promising, if known, as mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy spending time with her spoiled boy of a son (Sandro Franchina). While mom and dad (blind Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at dinner, the toddler tries to kill himself and create a life-changing series of events that Bergman spends on the poor and needy compassion. Detected by Communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she spends more time with the frail as she does with her husband, who will soon close her into a mad asylum for her problems. Bergman plays the role of the sacred role in the role of her 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of relieving and filming her. Unfortunately, the author pounds his point home with ham-fisted subtlety, as Andrea and Ma take turns taking Marxist and Christian platitudes. At the last tear-watered scene I had more than my filling of these tiring characters. A real step for Rossellini as he snatched neo-realism and embraced the mythological and mystical themes of the 1950's Flowers of St Francis.
