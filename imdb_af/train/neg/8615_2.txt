This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had difficult times to see it to the end. I saw this Rodney man in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny like hell, but this movie is crazy. The "jokes" were not funny, actors were not funny, anything about them was not even funny. Don't waste your time! Only positive things about this were the beautiful women :) and Molly Shannon, who I was sure, tried her best, but the writing was just too terrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
