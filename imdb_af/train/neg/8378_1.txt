This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole "Little Man" shit is just as stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and stupid. Let's see it, it's just a "black comedy". It's just an inexorable horrible piece that never had to make it into the theaters. The jokes aren't funny and the acting is terrible. Please, I beg you to save your money than to see this worthless piece of shit. I had to sit an hour and a half through My Manie and wanted my eyes to bleed. I'm disgusting that even such a thing will be thought of! Who writes this crap? The actors have no talent so ever, how come these people in Hollywood? They make money from this litter!
