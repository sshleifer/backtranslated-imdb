I only saw the movie recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining movie, but I want to tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not much talk, as you may have noticed. She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who just stared at his point and then knocked the shit out of the opponents. Throughout the movie I waited at least to hear a confession about what she liked, why did she fight, who loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialogue. Don't see it unless you want to be bored of your mind! It's so bad, I finally wondered how I couldn't scream in frustration one and a half hours. Roughly. I give a 4/10.
