- Includes mine-spoilers - <br /> <br /> I've seen a number of decent Indian horror movies like The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; Unfortunately, I feel Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From start to finish, the film is bothered by amateurish acting resonance from a very weak writing. God just knows why the writer thought dialogue like, "No, don't go outside, don't go out there, she'll get you. If she gets you, she'll kill you and if she kills you, you're dead. . "is of film quality. <br /> <br /> This film shows very little character development and to be honest, I couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted on them, because they are just a group of these college girls who are almost no redeeming features do not show. "All they do is cry and blow through the whole movie and if the girls don't cry their arguments; when they talk, the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the girls' father has recently been bruised (appropriate subjects when you are chased by a psychotic killer). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also unmistakable display of Corny Techno music during both the start and end credits (although the credit music knows the end was closer, looked like heaven). <br /> <br /> The camera work is terrible and sometimes makes the movie inactive. Because of little or no budget, I guess the director is limited to just one digital camera that lives almost the entire movie in the girls' car. I think it was an effort to keep the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and to experience what the girls are doing. But due to a very shaky camera, grainy picture and too close to the action, it can be difficult to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a movie subjective, but it's another to act on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of poor cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget. movie, but it does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no reasoning factors for this movie: bad acting, poor essay, scary camera work and no story. In light of this, I decided to give the movie 1 out of 10 because it left me very disappointed; I want a meteorite to hit the earth, so relieved me. His 94 minutes of stupid college girls are crying, arguing, purposefully running and with random inappropriate conversations. But how often do you get girls smothering in their hands and throwing the shit on the windshield of a hunting car.
