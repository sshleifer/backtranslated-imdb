I have to predict this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man seems to think of some of the funniest action snaps and that's probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler * although there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler, as the scripts are so absurd to start with: a chase with a disabled child with a pistol versus a man on a Harley with a machine gun, through high school and the child wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to custody. Dolph, if you read it, thank you for the laughing, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: Terrific film that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends about this and forcing them to sit down. Hilarious.
