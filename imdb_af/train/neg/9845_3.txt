!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILS !!!!! <br /> <br /> While watching the first half of FAITH AS SON, I couldn't believe it was made in 1993, as it played like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the middle. 80s. It starts with a murder and it is for the audience to go to museums. "Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to sleep with his lawyer?" But halfway through the film, his early 90s showed credentials by a lawyer. manipulated and stalked by her client-type movie ending in a ridiculous way, and FAITH AS SON has an even more ridiculous ending in this regard. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad thriller, but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it is directed by Sidney Lumet the same man we always have classic court room drama 12 Angry Men
