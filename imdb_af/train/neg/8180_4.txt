The reason why the DVD releases of this movie are black and white is because no one can get their hands on a color print of this public domain movie, a modest sea story at best. <br /> <br /> Distributed for television by Allied Artists, DVDs (or VHS) currently on the market for this title, all come from the same 16MM television print. Films broadcast for television before 1963 were often distributed in b / w prints, because most of the viewers did not have color sets anyway. Striking television b / w prints were also cheaper, as it often involves quite a few prints covering all stations using a movie on a syndicated basis.
