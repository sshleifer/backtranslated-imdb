It was my first, and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to come to it, as it was Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, and a movie by Theo, of whom I heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep soldier across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie has big holes and I don't know what to talk about. The main chart of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minute monologue that murders the action and viewers, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart from this old lady telling a story. All that is supposed to be shown by action is simply told by the old woman to the camera. In an instant, the TV outfit went to the bar. They turn the corner and immediately start the winter! Probably, shot in different days, leaked continuity. Many problems with the story story, sounded from absurd to irrational, never linked to a style, so the viewer asked questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, a role that lacked in integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people agree, the movies have shown very historical, ethnic or political inaccuracy just for the sake of making a film about humanity as a red in another review . Much more to say, but no time to lose on a poor movie, which was not movie at all, but the lust of a person who impressed the film and was paid with state money.
