This is the worst movie I've seen for years! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. I think when will something happen in this movie ,,,, and the acting is worse. The end raises it slightly and saves the movie from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good, but this one sucks.
