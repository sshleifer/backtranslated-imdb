This "movie" aims to follow the genre of low budget, hand-camera flashes that have proven very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one, failed, and HOW. <br /> <br /> It is wonderful how many so-called "awards" this piece of garbage has put on the cover ... it makes you wonder what these critics were when they actually submitted it. <br /> <br /> Words fail to describe how absolutely horrible this movie really is. Seriously it is so little. <br /> <br /> I watched it in 20 minutes, at almost constant speed. <br /> <br /> From garbage lighting to terrible directing, grainy footage to muted sound, and of course, don't forget the ABYSMAL acting, it was a totally and completely pathetic piece of so-called filmmaking. <br /> <br /> It's serious, has NO redeeming features - whatsoever. Save your money and watch a decent low budget horror flick, there are plenty out there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name but a few. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage at all costs. Don't waste your money or time on this piece of trash as if it were a real movie. <br /> <br /> Note all the other comments! You have been warned!
