This movie is a loose collection of incomprehensible analogies and bad plans. <br /> <br /> Film History: The director of this film was a pervert who filmed throughout the town filming random women. When his wife discovered the movies, he was forced to quickly create a story. He claimed he made a movie called "The Brain That Wouldn't Die." Eventually, his wife asked him to show her his "so-called movie". That night, he quickly filmed a few extra scenes with a friend and the "Brain who wouldn't die" was born. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Plot Overview: The main character's fiance is murdered in a horrible car accident (caused by ignoring the clearly placed road signs). He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After symbolizing the head, he picks up a bunch of hookers. That's pretty much what happens to the rest of the movie. In the end he fights and is killed by a monster living in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume they stay happy. <br /> <br /> Side notes: The end credit screen claims the movie is called the head that would not die. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
