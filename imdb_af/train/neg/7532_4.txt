Something I really like about this woman's short films was the elimination of the theme - especially in "Living with Happiness." This movie has some good beginnings - unusual place and the potential for a strange movie treat, but fails to succeed with some exponential dialogue, patchic performances and lots of television coverage. <br /> <br /> It is again a beautiful television and very ordinary theater. The ideas are so explained that they almost feel like a television commercial. But the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see this director make a full-length animation and try to work with a producer who doesn't demand so much clarity.
