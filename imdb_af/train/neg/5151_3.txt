I thought it was a good idea, but, son, it was poorly executed. We get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the background performances of a show are, but virtually no details of any of them work. The producers did not find a way to tell a story or give the viewer a "throughline". (That's not to say they didn't try, but with the stage hands a summary of the Ring cycle comes in because the program's story does nothing to tell us about the physical opera performance.) <Br / > <br /> We see a lot of things happening, but little is told about what people are doing and why. There is little sense of who is who, or how the different production departments fit and work. For example, a few times we hear of a problem of one kind or another: one then expects to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is solved. Instead, the filmmakers usually only cut something else (usually, nice generic footage of people who are talking or talking in the headset.) <br /> <br /> In general, the movie feels more like a pastiche of images you want to see run under the end credits of a show, rather than anything worth looking at for its own merit.
