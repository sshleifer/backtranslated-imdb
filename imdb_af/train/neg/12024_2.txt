Quite the boring nonsense I've seen long ago. The plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, camera angles that made me feel sick, used the accidental music and drowned out the dialogue (maybe it's not bad) and San Francisco's shots seem to be straight from the advertising video of the city's tourist board. Oh, and the compulsory sex scene wasn't even half done. Better lighting next time, please.
