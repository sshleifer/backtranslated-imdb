... for this movie defines a new layer in Bollywood and set the default by which all c ** p should be compared. <br /> <br /> First, the beginning had elements of style .... And if it is handled well, it could have become a cult classic, a-la pulp fiction or a desi desperado ... but the plot (was there one?) Started to meander and at one point completely lost. <br /> <Bring in a swollen donkey with an obsession for English, a call center-smart Alec, a femme fa story featuring a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb, a levitating, gravity attack and a policeman with a hundred (or was it a thousand) black cat commandos on their route .... good ingredients in skilled hands. But this is where I want to ask the director: Sir, what were you smoking? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film - for what should never be done - insulting the intelligence of most brain deaths of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music ... watch the videos ... hear the airplay and you won't be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar comes up with some particularly hummable songs. <br /> <br /> How I wish the director spent the money to create even more hippo. <br /> <br /> As I sign off, I really want to know how Akshay's dot of wound disappears in a microsecond ... what did your editors do? Tashan, maybe ...
