'1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. The kind that can cause the date movie-stored horror fans to jump into their seats and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences looking for some depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusak is a writer who has made a career in writing books that describes his experiences of staying in rumored haunted homes. In spite of customer and owner assurances that the tracks are moving around the hall, there is little to make him a true believer in the paranormal. When he learns about the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel - without waiting, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York. He decides that it will make the perfect closing chapter for his latest book. But the hotel owner Samuel L. Jackson is trying to sharply refuse his guests with the story of the atrocities that have occurred in the theater since the opening of the hotel. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, have to sit down by Jackson's long foreshadowing ramble. <br /> <br /> In other words: be scared! Be very scared! <br /> <br /> It will of course be easy to convince audiences that they have just paid to see a brand new piece if it has not taken so long to build. to this point. And also, if it was followed, was much more than cheap "evil" that became so frequent and random that you could eventually expect them quickly. The room temperature changes automatically. The walls drop with blood. The fearless writer cannot open the door, etc. And after nearly half an hour of delivering to the audience, promising great excitement, you can sit and hope you can at least be saved by the end. With suspicions of dream sequence and other derivative timers, it becomes even unclear that before the film is over, we can eventually have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Despite great performances (as always) by Cusak, who is essentially the whole movie, most other notices (ie Samuel L. Jackson) are lost in insignificant minor roles. The real secret here is how this film received such a high-ranking viewer. Ballot-stuffing speeches?
