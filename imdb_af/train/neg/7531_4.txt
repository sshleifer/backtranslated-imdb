It is apparently a movie about several sadnesses. As such, it has to move viewers and empathize with the fate of the main characters. However, his annoying postmodern style makes it incomprehensible. The camera ranges from one scene to another continuously, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a bumpy, unobstructed effect. Most characters seem to live aimlessly, unstructured lives, held together by their professional obligations. (It also includes credibility that a man who has just been given a probable death sentence will be excited about a sex skirt with a woman he has just met). The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. In summary, the overall effect is rather disappointing. In spite of everything, the play is generally good and some of the screens are very powerful.
