Dr. Tarr's torture Dungeon is about a journalist traveling to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon finds out that things don't look like they are, and the asylum is being managed by the patients, and the doctors are a cage. First, some parts of the movie are just boring and you just fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks he's a chicken, for example). I have to admit that the story is pretty good, but the movie itself bombs. The music of the movie is really strange and like something you will hear in a crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene where dancing chicken men are involved, which pretty much has me to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Valued: R for violence and nudity.
