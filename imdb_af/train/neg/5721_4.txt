I was not a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit "Hostel", and most of these lame are knock-offs are just as bad or worse - but Live Feed has really entertained me for about the first 30 minutes. Start with many sex and messy institutions, followed by some good deaths with the Chinese Organized Crime Group and a 7-foot-hoe butcher ... What put me out of the movie was the tough "hero" with the guns and a resentment that saves the day ... I will call this movie mediocre, at best, as an assumption that unnecessary young people are sleeping in a cunning porn theater doubles as a hiding place for the mafia, enticing me . If the torture were just enough to be thoroughly effective, my judgment would have been very different. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is piled on one scene. The rest of the movie is concluded as a revenge-type scenario. So, basically, it's just a low-budget "Hostel" rip-off with the redeeming use of free sex, almost constant during the first half of the movie ... Overall, I'd say, don't bother with this one .
