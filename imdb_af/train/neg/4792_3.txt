Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to raise this movie, I simply can't. The movie looks like it's been sold out. First bad signs come when the video fans for other movies have started (something the other didn't do). Also too many senseless characters, showy examples, the child (who is a shot shot, initially funny, but soon you want to kill him), the woman who uses karate to fight the balls (it won't work, or rather ) and the blooming zombies (who do the hell there, there is no connection with them in the other Phatasms). There is also a serious shortage of midgets. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the creaking start and of course Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILER comes on) << br /> <br /> For me this movie looks like a filler between II and IV, because extra characters just leave at the end. So it can continue with IV in IV. Overall, very, very disappointing. 3/10
