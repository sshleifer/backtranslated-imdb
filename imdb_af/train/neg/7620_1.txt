I rented this movie because it sounded very interesting, but for my Horror this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen! I read the comments of Gumby-8 and he must be part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old child or a demented cult member, no one in their own mind will think this movie has any potential. <br /> <br /> I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comment. <br /> <br /> Quoting: "From the" Dune "inspired opening animation to the fast pace ... this movie keeps the eye moving and works so well that the replay of the show is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> The animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact that the movie is moving, though, is because you're looking for some kind of tension. I mean, give me a break. Halloween was shot with a $ 100,000.00 budget and a painted mask and also became a cult classic along the way. As far as "repeat doesn't look unexpected", I think he made a tick. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: "The play is also a strong aspect of the movie." /> <br /> With all due respect to the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The catchy Tagline: "Adjust the hour between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> This is because there is no twilight or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Rated R for some violence / gore" <br /> <br /> The only thing you see is a red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know, it might be a lot of grass. <br /> <br /> In summary, I saw horror foliage of the 50's, 60's and 70's. I saw what I thought was the worst and some were very good. The director of this movie also made no effort, fell asleep or hit a hit of acid. Whatever the case, I think the actors deserve applause to try and save a very bad job. I will give this movie a .5 score for a "B" movie.
