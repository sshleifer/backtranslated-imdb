It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But the little maid, Alice and Jared Harris follow Christopher Walken, is what makes this movie entertaining. Alice's smoking, drinking and uncomfortable way of standing when her name is mentioned is strange and interesting. I need to applaud Jared for his Christopher Walken imitation, and Christopher Walken to allow it to be in the movie.
