Oddly enough, Season 6 of the Columbo series contains only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this outing for the "man-in-the-mac" and also "Fade in Murder" ". <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman both wrote the aforementioned scripts (he also plays the part of the murdered security guard here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very seldom compelling and many of the artists just don't care about the material. The story has developed rather poorly with some prolonged periods of boring conversation. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also screened here by a colleague (similar to "Last Salute to Commodore"), but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, Celeste's Holm characterization, which is meant to give comedy, is embarrassing rather than laughter. <br /> <br /> The writing wavers off to handle the family history and the killer do enough to give Columbo the case. But there is never a credible discussion on the motives of her crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what seems to be, probably, Columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series. He tests a male hairdresser and has a haircut / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that Columbo's hair is so well cared for, he can't afford to pay the bill, and if he asks for a jewelers, he mirrors the mirror. admire his hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment of a script that seems to be in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo Finalists.
