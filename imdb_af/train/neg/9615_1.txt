It turns out this adjustment he didn't do. He not only left the plot, he made his own! The things he chose to go into were so ridiculously amazing that I was happy that he chose to go out of the key parts of the novel. The plot was vague, inconsistent and messy to say the least. I don't want to say anything about the actors, but they can't act! Dickens is of course difficult, but it is pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century Kramer, and the less Betsy Trotwood said the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, look at the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the scriptwriter, I think he reads the Cliff's Notes!
