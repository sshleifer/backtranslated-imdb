I'm curious, it's really two films in half, it's Lena's sexual experimental side and the other half is her curiosity with political / socialism. Whatever the director's intentions, the two don't really touch. The director should just hold onto the romantic side of Lena and make a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mix of political / war meetings, Dr King, serious political interviews, flopping breasts and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Besides the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the nude / sexual scenes are exaggerated for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a great derivation of whatever plot is. However, I think the role player did a good job. They played their parts credibly. There are few of the over-the-tops that I am so used to seeing in American movies at this time.
