Bad actors, bad filming, good dialogue, level characters, but then it was a bad starting point. Basically, an 11-year-old being bullied because he has very little money gets a blind check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11-year-old has enough technology and intelligence to buy a home, buy a $ 1,000,000 check, and even increase three drops of idiots, thinking of the three stools. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is a boring, unpleasant boy who decides that when he has written a blind check by a full stranger, he will make the most of the situation. In other words, he goes astray in a bank, <br /> <br /> handles a counter a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously runs out with a million dollars in cash. Preston is also apparently able to reach incredible speed on his bike, because a man driving a Jaguar could not catch Preston and his 10-speed, even when Preston drove a row of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there must be hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine is a child molesting the FBI agent dating the 11-year-old Preston and promising another date when he turns 17. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst aspect of this movie, however, was not its decisive, or its messy dialogue, such as: "The only other way I can think of fleeing a cat is to snake a snake it is a butt and then the fur adds up. " Rather, it was the fact that nobody in the whole film realized that the FBI didn't give a sentence of arbitrary people. What I didn't explain is that Preston uses the nickname "Macintosh" to mask as an entrepreneur of its kind. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine to Preston, who uses his 11-year-old white to scream when crayfish falls on his face, then treat her for hamburgers and end up with a ridiculous skirt through a cement area where waterfowl is off the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal who is pursuing the FBI slides and slides to the right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a one-dimensional driver who never fails to buy cheaply 3rd rate supply. laughing that the whole family can choke. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1/10 is incredibly gracious to this movie. I don't see how it only has a 4.4 / 10.
