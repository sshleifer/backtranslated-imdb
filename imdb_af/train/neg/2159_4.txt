Well, it's Robin Hood as 'geezer' right, just like advertised! It doesn't sound very hopeful, and unfortunately, it was worse than I suspected. <br /> <br /> A Latte Robin I can take; A robin who touches a paternal's daughter I can credit; But a Robin who doesn't exchange a very funny rider is harder to swallow, and a Robin and a whole pot * worth driving their lines is the kiss of punishment. How can someone allow such delivery to pass without shooting the screens again? Again and again, many sound like he is struggling with half a gifted Shakespeare rather than loosening with a salty joke; I was hoping at the start that it was just a failed comedy feature in a character that was clearly intended for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it spread throughout the rest of the role. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he had the ability to deliver the advanced dialogue as naturally as if he had just seen it right now. And as this production shows, it doesn't sound that easy! If they are going to throw the characters as fiery hats, the relevant actors must get appropriate lines: they sound like they have no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I didn't even suffer the pantomime sheriff for the same reason; The lines are clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but delivered (and in this case written) with a wink and a wink at the audience. They are in the right place - fourth wall-busting stuff - but not really that funny. <br /> <br /> This promised production reminds me of a discolored school game. The only actor and character I ever felt was the one that Guy or Gisbourne plays, which was the only one that dealt with a credible villain and (b) credible characterization - but honestly I would not have said it was a very good forecast for the future of the series! From the time of writing I will give it another chance in the hope that things can improve and sleep a bit next week, with less stylized scene adjustments and perhaps the actors are more comfortable with the dialogue: after all, the opening episode of "Doctor Who" was not exactly a show stop, but it was nowhere as bad as it was. But if after episode 2 I see no improvement, I'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer. <br /> <br /> What would be a pity because I have a soft spot for Robin Hood's "legend on the screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the solid trust of Richard Greene. But this Robin fails me let blood in the slightest stir.
