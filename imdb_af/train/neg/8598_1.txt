I just joke! It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! However, it was so bad that it was hilarious. My friend and I have deliberately rented it because it looks so bad. Cheesy old horror flicks are always good for a few laughs. The plot bumped, some of the voices were baptized, the quality was terrible. But I probably had an explosion to see it!
