In fact, it's basically the same movie. And they can't even get the timing of events right. Maybe it was deliberate because of laziness or not caring. Either way, this thing is a real woofer. it doesn't even deserve. to be called a movie. I saw it as a second feature on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman. I thought my head would explode and I encourage you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing as you are being cursed by the accident of combing the road. It should come with a warning label such as: Warning - can drop your IQ if you are in the area. For me, there is no doubt that this thing is a 0/10.
