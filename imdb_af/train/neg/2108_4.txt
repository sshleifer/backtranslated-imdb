A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen on the way to the mortuary. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. She discovered it right before every ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (presumably from the groom) that contained a powerful drug they had succumbed. Patricia is told that the orchid first with a dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate, grows up with his wife. In fact, dr. Lorenz responsible for the crimes, placing the brides in a suspended condition and using their glandular fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, with dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical riddle around his wife), try dr. Lorenz's hand forces up a fake wedding, eventually leading Patricia into the mad doctor's clutches. This movie had a very good opening pool, but actually ended up with too many boots and other bad scenes. The throw is decent, Walters and Kis earn better, but it's life. Russell steals the performance (even from hamming Lugosi, who does not give one of his more memorable performances, even if his Monograms are considered) as Countess Lorenz plays the features of many of the stereotypical features of many of today's Hollywood fine donnas. Poor and constructed end too. Evaluation based on B movies, 4.
