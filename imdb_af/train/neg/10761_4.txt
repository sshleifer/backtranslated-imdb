This movie was a mess. It has the absolute worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of a scene, the author wanted to go commercially, and the filmmaker added a second black screen to fulfill the author's dream. <br /> <br /> Under the rough direction and editing there was a brightness of something good. A good idea, a compelling spark. But somewhere it went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as priest. Well, the part doesn't call him to be a good priest and he rather succeeds well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy. He always plays the crazy bad guy. Thank you very much. <br /> <br /> Oh, a thought occurred to me that perhaps all the jumping, horrible editing and disconnected plot was a sense of confusion that the character (Grieco) experienced. And just to prove that it was confronted, they withdrew the credits. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
