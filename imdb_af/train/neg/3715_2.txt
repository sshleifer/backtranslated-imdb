Black man becomes rich white man, and a rich white man looks like hip hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this movie are playing. The problem I have is that it doesn't work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to grab such a corpse and start acting like Charles Wellington. It would be too much to ask. I'll give it. But at the same time, it's going too far in the other direction. I'm supposed to sing a rich white man who rap and play completely exciting things, as he is a bastion of hip hop culture, and people just accept him *? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white man *, even though she doesn't care about his money or strength? It's so amazing, it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I couldn't suspend unbelief and I couldn't finish the movie. I added one extra star because it made me even difficult, several times. But I just couldn't pass the whole "white hiphop man" who has never been well done in any movie I've ever seen trying it out. It was no exception.
