I don't really know where to start. The play in this movie was really horrible, I can't remember so many 'actors' being seen in one movie that was incapable of acting. Not only the acting was bad, the characters were also incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there's the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, there is blood involved. But if somebody is shot for ten (!) Times in a sob, there is no blood at all. Well, I think it's just me. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short (because I believe I can spend hours on this movie), it is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This film should undoubtedly be number 1 in the bottom 100.
