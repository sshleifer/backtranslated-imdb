It was one of the coolest movies we've been watching over the past few months with a predictable plot line and very bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hugh Laurie made a lot of effort to learn how to dance the Samba, but the scale of his character just needed. He immersed himself at the kiddie end of the pool. The movie is based on the look of a lovely girl and good music, but it's not enough to make good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio, or inside a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
