Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than GUTS OR A BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore flick is a can (at least once). <br /> <br /> Sleazy snapshotters escort to actresses / models to a remote home in the bush to sexually molest them. Unfortunately (for the horny boys), a prolonged devil who lives in the bush, the girls have been doing the fun. <br /> <br /> The thing even ends up having fun with the boys - it's IF you see beheadings, dismemberment and masturbation with cut limbs "fun". <br /> <br /> Again, it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film. <br /> <br /> Like Komizu Mangled LIVING DEAD IN TOKYO BAY with its inflexibility, he also has this effort and is only saved by some brave violence and some great white panty shots. <br /> <br /> Don't buy the hype or you'll be very disappointed.
