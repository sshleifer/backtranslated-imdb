Have you ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, it didn't even have one to start. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The painful boring scenes of our heroine sitting around the house didn't really create a sense of threat or even ominous, even during the seemingly constant thunderstorms (which are actually never heard in the house - huge double glazing)? The house, which is apparently just a few miles from a town, still runs away for a few hours (?) Or the third girl who doesn't serve a purpose for the plot, except to give a surprisingly fast yawn, just like the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning that represents a wave of 20+ murders across the area, although it clearly appears that the killer never pulls far from home? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt and pepper summarizing most of the films' inherent lack of direction. <br /> <br /> Add a main actress who can't act but at least is willing to do something completely irrelevant. Nude tones and this video is actually nasty, but not as you hope. <br /> <br /> Given another simply to be banned in the UK in the 80s (mostly due to a final surprise on prolonged murder) It offers nothing but curiosity value - and a classic "murder" murder (Don't worry - this is at least ten minutes earlier telegraphed). After a walk in the woods, our victim comes to a little steep uphill slope which of course they struggle with. Halfway through they see a figure top of black dressed and a big shoot. What are they doing? Move down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not-they struggle to the top and are comfortably comfortable and upright in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie as they say ..
