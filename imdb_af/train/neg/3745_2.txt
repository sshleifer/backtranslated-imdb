First; It is very anesthetic to try to describe history, only from rifle, germ and steel positions. The same tried to make Marxists out of economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success cannot just be dumb luck, the benefits of easy plants and animals. We see that the benefits and bonuses around the world are completely useless if they are not managed wisely. In Japan, there are not large natural resources, but Japan is one of the global economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, there is only medium-low success. Both of these nations still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why is that so? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond stated that it is very important to understand rifle, germ and steel factors to understand. Perhaps the most important factor in the world's difference is not geography, but people's ability to understand and use things? The mental ability to understand. And in this case, geography is only subordinate.
