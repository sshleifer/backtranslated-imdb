OMG! The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-the-box. Apart from this, how did this half-way movie subscribe to do such a lame film? Maybe it was a good idea right now. There is no reason to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the throw is messed up, the direction is amateur. Now that I think about it, most of the debt probably lies with the director, Joel Zwick. He does nothing but flat out of all the people involved. Don't waste your time as I did; but then I enjoy a good train wreck. Geez, now the system told me I need more lines - here you go: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now it's more funny than anything in the movie ...
