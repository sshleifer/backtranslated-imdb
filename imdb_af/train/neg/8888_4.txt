I rated Basic instinct 2 high, but that movie got less than a 4-rating. This movie only got 4 of me, but it has 7.3 out of over 600 people. I don't see a reason why they love this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring because it almost never leaves those rooms in the broken big house. And it only has a total of 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours, which is completely unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The movie tone is also dark blue, which is depressed to watch. The movie can only be shortened to a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien, one is equally boring, the dialogues are equally boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop looking at the one after the first story was finished. <br /> <br /> This movie has no passion or excitement.
