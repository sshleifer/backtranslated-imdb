It's a complete and absolute rubbish, a good example of how a BAD movie is. It can't be attractive to everyone, not even b-movie fans. Do not waste, repeat, NO precious time of your life on this piece of waste. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible (but I really mean terrible) writing, and complete lack of an idea of ​​what entertainment (of any kind) is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. That won't be enough for what this movie did for me. I like b-movies, the killer toys, the strange lagoon monsters, but it's nowhere near. You know those movies that are so bad, are they funny? Not even. Not old, pathetic.
