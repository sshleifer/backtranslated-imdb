It is an art film made in 1969 or 1972. (The National Film Conservation Fund says 1969 and IMDb say 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the movie certainly seems very indicative of this general period - with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> The movie is made up of three simple images that are distorted using various strange camera tricks. These twisted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. Of course, it was meant to be almost like a form of performance art, and like most performing art, it was initially interesting, but quickly became tiring. The movie, to make it even more blunt, is a total drill and will appeal to no one, but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends, and perhaps a few people too hip and "with" to understand us mortals.
