This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I don't even joke. It was poor and the actors couldn't act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could put together on our own. The case where the movie enters is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie in front of the case. It seems that the director or makeup artist just sits under the eyes of a black eye catcher and called a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes from the movie. Which watched the credits was the best part of the movie. It was frankly a horrible movie and I couldn't believe how bad it was. Scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes you were like "what's going on?" The sound was terrible and the action shots look like a couple of teenagers joking to make a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying this movie, I would recommend looking at at least the trailer for This because it shows how terrible it really is. I wish I'd watched it before renting it.
