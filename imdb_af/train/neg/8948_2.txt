'Ninteen Eighty-eight' is a film about a futuristic society in which government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It's a very dark movie, and it's one that won't make you feel good about yourself. It's about a romance that takes place in this society and the betrayal of lovers and human nature is independent. The film has some very good ideas and is well done to portray this society with the dark colors in colors (as opposed to happiness and bright colors in the dreams) and a general sense of loneliness by objects and people and places . However, despite the film's ingenuity to portray this idea, the movie was very slow and didn't have the idea to get the idea right. It seems too much time to be smart rather than telling a story.
