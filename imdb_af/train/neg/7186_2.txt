I'm sorry for all the fans, but it's a useless movie. The acting is bad, even wood, and it exceeds the fright factor early and doesn't work exactly. I think at the end was supposed to be a twist, but it just became ridiculously confusing. What the hell? The man who killed everyone was one of the hunts? Please try again. <br /> <br /> It's hardly original, and it's not even as good as a straight shoemaker. And it says something. <br /> <br /> I think everyone who did the cast, who wrote the script, and whoever thought of the concept, should be ruthlessly dismissed and deported. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. If someone puts it on a party, throw the disc out of the window and put a good horror movie, such as Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
