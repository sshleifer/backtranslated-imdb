Spoilers will be here. The movie could have been better if they had just another script, director and CGI provider. Not much right? The movie has a man who starts his own theme park ... Err ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... Err ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... Oops ... Primal Park . I don't mind rip-offs, because there are no original ideas for this kind of movie, but this one just hits you. There is even the shoulder's shadow on the design. The Sabretooths, who are not sabretooths, said. Primal Park (just old kitten cats) is quite young, but the crowning is the one I call "Sloggy". Because after a big cat is thrown away, a hero is a bit relaxing because there is only one. Enter the strange bird that says: Nah, we made three, the third is a monster pulling it with its front legs. Big, rough. A group of university students are also on the island for a hunter hunt, there to try to get in their clothes or to sort (always thought it needed a short nickname). Out of the one alive, only one of them has completed their task, so I have a kick out of it. Oh yes, the obligatory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" Clique is in force with none, but two of them! Mr. Primal Park's death is the most laughing thing you will see in one of these movies as a Sabretooth image loosening (courtesy of Sloggy), shrinking a few sizes and sobbing the man through the throat. If I got away so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
