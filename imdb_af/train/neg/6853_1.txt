Another trashy Grade Z tuck from the productive Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like outer space policeman is chasing an ugly flying head (!) To the Earth and engaging in a gang war in the South Bronx! Merely short but deadly boring, with the cutest effects since the 50Ft woman's attack. They also had to dismiss the continuity man: Note how Thomerson's sunglasses disappear and appear in every second shot. Laughably bad, but that's why we watch these movies or not? Sequel Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys is reported to be even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (from ****) <br /> <br />
