I had to do a search on the actresses to find the advice of this movie, because the title is now an unexpected love. It's not really worth looking for, but I was unfamiliar with both lines and wondered why they were leading a lesbian movie at age. Everything is nicely held and you don't really get an idea of ​​who these characters are like, as a viewer, I couldn't be invested emotionally in the storyline. I don't think I'm the target audience for this, but I don't know who it is. Everything is muted and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a great interest in seeing two women, but it is so strategically treated that I was disappointed. Hire Personal Best instead.
