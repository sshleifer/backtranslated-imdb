This movie is about a very sexy Olympic tracker hired to coach a high school boys' basketball team. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, it is Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and she does as well as the writing allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but consider the movie's apparent TV movie budget, but they certainly couldn't afford her. Cathy Lee looks good in every shot, but we never get her naked. The story is pretty predictable, to say the least, without surprises. A young and happy Michael Biehn has the male lead role. He is the star on the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman has to train sport. This point is educated throughout the film, and it is unnecessary to say that it is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she does nothing that a male coach will not do. There is a funny sub-plot involving a long and not-so-clear player who is undergoing hypnosis to pass his classes and play the pro basketball player Sydney Wicks. Everyone seems to have had a good time making this movie, but the only real reason to see it is Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not such a great actress, but she has a brilliant smile, beautiful hair and a very brown body.
