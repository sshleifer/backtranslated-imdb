Terrible action by Potter and a flat plot without tension ever. And as far as feminist polemics are concerned, it's laughable. I saw this garbage when it was first released and although I found it boring, I'm glad I saw it. That's because I now have an immediate answer to the question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" I also have the convenience of knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than the Tango lesson. But I have to admit I was impressed with the way in which Potter wrote a script that will obtain the maximum number of art grants from around the world (as disclosed in the closing credits). <br /> <br /> I'm just seeing Orlando recently and I can see how Potter learned the wrong lessons to make the movie. All it took was a bunch of costumes, a few stiff looks at the camera by the front lady, and a loose plan to seduce the movie. So why shouldn't she think she can get away with the self-reliant thing the Tango lesson is?
