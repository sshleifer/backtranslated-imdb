Oh me. I decided to go to the theater with some friends, to watch one of those soft, good-looking Christmas movies, and I disgust. The movie failed. Point. Paul Giamatti, who I consider to be a good actor, played his character and just grew terribly, along with Vince Vaughn, who has always been a personal favorite of mine. They are trying to change a Christmas movie, in a few new styles. Kind of bad, mixed with good, but it all turned out very wrong. The first ten or so minutes were not bad, but as soon as we saw Santa, it was over. It didn't get any better, the rate remained the same, there was NO character development and is definitely one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Don't look at it, whatever you do.
