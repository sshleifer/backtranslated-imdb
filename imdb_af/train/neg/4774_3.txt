I'm not sure if the filmmakers get to a Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Men (people who pull the facts up for the truth). Whatever it was, it was poorly done and not worth the look. <br /> <br /> I don't look at movies for blood and gore, but because this movie hasn't gone for it yet, it had to show the real murder. more. Most were off-camera, reducing the horror we were supposed to feel at death. <br /> <br /> It also criticized me for police being among the victims; he subconsciously contributed to the innocent young man who had gone to prison by accepting vouchers (by giving MJH to him) in the evidence room. (And if MJH wasn't the lawyer, had access to that evidence - take it out and return the wrong evidence - anyway, so she didn't need the cop's help?). The other, while they often did not realize it, was this particular person who injured them, playing ever greater roles in his ultimate downfall. The gun dealer must have known his guns will be used for the wrong purpose. Of course, the insurance man rejected a person in need, etc. But the police's crime was in comparison as he didn't know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him the one who encouraged MJH to plant the evidence, which would make him more punishable. And MJH's shouting that he (the policeman) got her in the mess, doesn't make sense at all. <br /> <br /> It would be more interesting if each person died in a way that gave the other an idea of ​​why he / she was there and deserved to die. For example, the insurance man pushed the applications he rejected into his throat so that he was bothering them; The Eastern woman could have taken her eyes out quickly because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violent that the gun dies, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue wasn't funny, there was no turn, and the end was one of the worse (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The finish hit three stars of my rating. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially given the rubbish lines and motivation they had to work with. <br /> <br /> Overall a waste of time.
