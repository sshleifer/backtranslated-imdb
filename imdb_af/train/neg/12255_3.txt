... that is not exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Sure, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss bag that helped the whole movie cry over his little brother who was eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better, and the acting was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a child's model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. is hiding on a deserted island, where they meet a racial group of ugly Filipino residents trying to force themselves on the women in the group. It was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough crocodile. There are some redeeming features of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the crocodile at the end of the movie. But if you're on your deathbed and just have enough time to watch a Matt Borlenghi / killer crocodile movie, skip it and save "DinoCroc".
