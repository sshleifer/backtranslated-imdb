Horror / Sci-Fi that's interesting because it's laughing. F / X pretty good ... for what you manage to see. A made for TV excitement that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant but deceived scientist who stomps with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The terrible results give one hell of a murder machine birth. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to explore the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after he laughed and was upset. Coombs' creation, incidentally, is his own son who has been melted with a hammerhead, to release his father's colleagues one by one. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
