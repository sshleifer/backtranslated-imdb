This is the sound of Stan and Ollie turning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not save the fundamental errors of this movie as it is so obvious that they are without saying. Little things like the All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy, though the stars have been dead for over 30 years when made. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be to play actors buffalo called Laurel and Hardy. Worse if it is, it may have worked. For a very bad idea, try to cast two actors to personalize the duo. Okay, they can claim to be cousins, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Well, forget about his crazy stranger, "Nephew Larry", Schtick in Perfect Strangers, and look at him in True Romance. Here he stinks. It's probably not his fault, and like the director and the support cast - all who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. There are those who claim that Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This reason is not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistanis? Just in Stan's trademark, he comes close, but if the yelp is exaggerated to the point of tedium, it's nothing to write home about. Gailard Sartain does a little better than Ollie, though it's like saying what's worse - in the trash or kick in the crackers? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with their split second timing, intuitive teamwork and innate love? Well, it's completely absent, replace with two stupid old men and jokes so missed that you can park a bus through the gaps. While the originals had plots that could be summarized in a few panels, this has some long-winded Mummieshokum (and what an ugly title!) Mixed with the boys' fraternity scenario. I can't claim that each of Laurel and Hardy's seen 108 movies, but I think it's a safe bet that even their nadir leagues were before it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is that the originals were obvious, or at least with their own accent. It felt at least natural and unforgettable, unlike the confronted cartoons Pinchot and Sartain. And since when did Stan do malapropism, and so much with it? "I'll give you a standing cremation"; "I would like to marinate my girlfriend." Stop it! <br /> <br /> Only significant moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L&H cartoon. Of course, Harmon bought the name copyright (how disturbing to see an Â® to Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and manufacturer of this transvesty. <br /> <br /> Frequently asked questions. Will Stan and Ollie do it fast if they live today? Would they have glass mugs with broken bottles? Did Stan beat the genitals with a spear and end up on a big CGI finale? Let's hope. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think it's just unbelief about how terrible it is. Why was this movie made in the first place? Who thought the creators would like it? Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute disgust that I got sick to look after the first five minutes. About as much fun as having your head caught in a shot while a reddish poker and nettle penetrates your back section.
