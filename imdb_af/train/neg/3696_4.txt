Normally I would have given this movie a 6. It tackles a very important topic and it does so relatively well - despite Katie Wright's achievement and self. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if she was not actually instructed to play the character like this or is of course annoying, but she did a wonderful job making it impossible for Lexi to to see. There is no other dimension than how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is on fire. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder is out of control will be distressed, scared and in pain. However, Wright's full performance is based on ceaseless mockery and sobering, and the rest is watched. I couldn't help but feel that this particular girl's problem was not caused by the demon that Bulimia is, but she doesn't have a spine. I doubt it is the point the movie intended to make.
