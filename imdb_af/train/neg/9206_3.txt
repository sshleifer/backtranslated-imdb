The topic looks pretty dated today. Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe's book; We travel and stumble upon a fantasy. Four college students are deeply involved in playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deeply. His fellow players have to come to his rescue and save him from self-inflicted damage. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace make the game foursome. Support throws include veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date it looks clumsy and awkward. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his "Bosom Buddies" slaughter days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The latest viewer will enjoy the most.
