GENERAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally, the long wait AAG hits the scenes. Unfortunately, it cannot set progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to talk about the movie is to rebuild the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a good choice to change the overall background of the movie. If he repeats the same Ramghad background, people will say there is nothing new in it. Different backgrounds are appreciative, but the way he presented them is not worthy. From the beginning of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he used the same lighting and kind of background. I'm serious about this man, Waarma, thinking about lighting or not whether he has no other lighting technique than gordon willis GODFATHER. This is all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would some bodies use so many Dutch corners and extreme close ups !!!!!!! The kicking section is lame. Characters cannot carry an emotion, performances are not to their point. Storytelling is worse. Background is really awful. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz gave his priority to his job. VARMA has produced huge villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to cut the best characters of Hindi Cinema. There is no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a more psychic than a villain, but he still has a soft corner for his brother. (It's a gift in this movie). Amitabhz's performance is not to its point. His appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white theater. What they have ever worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is not comparable to Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first best thing about this character is not to put the audience in tension over his hands. If warmth did so, it would be to teach ABCD to a bachelor's degree. It's good he opened the secret early. But the look back is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor like mohanlal to his point. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character was improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body suffers or at least considers this character. The total failure of the movie starts when director can't work on the good friendship between our hero's. These characters have nothing to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is humiliating, reduced. AAG can be treated entirely as a C grade film. Sholay is a fire of revenge, a problem of a town, meaning of true friendship and highly valued nuisance and pleasure by Dharmendra. AAG never had an emotion with his characters. Storytelling is too weak to make the audience feel sympathetic to the characters. Don't compare AAG with shoay, but you won't like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare, watch this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
