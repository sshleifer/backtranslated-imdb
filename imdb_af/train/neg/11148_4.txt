This is the first example of a low budget and wins over what a good story line will be. Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong. After seeing her work at the OC, I know she can do better. Then find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer-generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (warning!) Who changed into a werewolf was done by first reducing her to a bad GCIF figure before she even started to change. (Final Fantasy's people, as well as Pixar's made this laugh, think of the figure as a naked Barbie Doll). <br /> <br /> The story of was interesting, although the idea of ​​bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. As it also came in the balance between evil, (perhaps) not so angry, and the possible end of human nature the two lines must have seemed. The subplot of a "book of werewolf games" that played some of the other characters in a playful way was effective, but could be expanded to explain what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring in better writing and direction, and I'll be back again.
