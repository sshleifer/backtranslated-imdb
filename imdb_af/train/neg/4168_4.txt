Well, this movie started to look funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more mature-oriented humor based on the first few moments, but then the movie had a bad design for Disney channel mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is beautiful but has a very fake Italian accent. The movie looks and sounds very independent and low budget. There was one very nice moment I would call the serenading scene, but overall it was a yawner. The laugh is very few and far between. The end surprise for "Fix It" is so ridiculous that it is more angry with me than anything else. It may be a good idea if you can catch it for free or TV, but don't waste your money on buying or renting this movie.
