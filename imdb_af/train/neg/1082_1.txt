I think I've seen all the Grisham movies and generally they are all very poor, except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it is incredible. <br /> <br /> SPOILERISH WARNING <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things no one will ever do. He is a lawyer for Christ's sake. Why, if his children are missing out, he won't call the police. Oh yes, that's because all the police hate lawyers so they just ignore him and let him be attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, just let him go, he'll be locked up in a cell. pending a bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why you'll drag your kids halfway across the country if you can easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> The police don't mind finding an escaped spiritual patient, they don't bother to support his daughter. <br /> <br /> Regarding the ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> In summary, stupid, very unrealistic and a total waste of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
