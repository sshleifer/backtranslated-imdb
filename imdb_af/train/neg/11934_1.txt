I put almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take it anymore. It felt like I had looked at dozens of episodes, and then it hit me ... There's nothing new here! I heard that joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like this on friends, an episode of Happy Days has almost the same story, and so on. Neither of the actors is also interesting here! Some were good at other shows (not here), and others are new to a career they should never have entered. Avoid this stinker!
