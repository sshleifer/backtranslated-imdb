If you really want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Look through the TV lists. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When "Men in White" comes, sit and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After putting two hours of bad words, horrible (and not funny) movie references, and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ​​ever made in recent history, you will have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly why . <br /> <br /> Why did I do this? I was dumb enough to think that this movie might be a little good. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're old enough to remember Power Rangers, you can touch some familiar faces during the movie. Presumably to save production costs, Saban (who has also made Power Rangers) decided to throw the old monster costumes of everyone's favorite sticky toy franchise into the film. I saw quite a few old monsters of episodes I saw when I was a child, so I think it can be said to have nostalgia. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see real power Rangers monsters, watch Power Rangers themselves. It's much better than this piece of garbage. (And it says something!)
