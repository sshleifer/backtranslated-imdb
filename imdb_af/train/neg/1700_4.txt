In film, I feel like it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This short by David Lynch tells a story but not much of one. I felt it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. These are good movies, but there really is nothing else. As I said before, I'm a big David Lynch fan, but I am frustrated by some of his work because I don't need it at all. It's definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I'm excited to see what he'll have in the future. If you like Lynch, you need to clear it up, but don't be surprised if you don't like it very much.
