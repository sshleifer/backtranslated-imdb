Although a little more polished than the previous movie in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, it is a weaker escapade in both a less exciting plot and a prominent man who simply does not have Ray Milland's charism. <br /> <br /> It is said that several actors and characters remain in their roles and succeed in keeping the flag flying. John Barrymore is also present, and through the film in a variety of exorbitant disguise. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is still an endless night for BD as he and his cohorts run around trying to save the poor girl he plans to marry. The clues are stupid, but again the supporting actors often entertain them.
