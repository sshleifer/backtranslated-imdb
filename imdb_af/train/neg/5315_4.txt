Colonel, space prisoner on space killing, driving a spacecraft to chop and escape to America's forest where he, along with some new found friend trying to escape from the 'Alienator' a female cyborg killing machine. Made a year after the Best movie of Fred Olen Ray's career, Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers. This one can't help but feel a bit of a show. Just as low budget as that previous movie, but not nearly as fun as I had with it. None of the actors really stood out to me. The movie is ready for the injudicious viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but it is almost all good. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
