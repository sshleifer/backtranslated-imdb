my friend bought the movie for 5? (it's not even worth 1 cent), because they wrote it was like American cake. but we will soon find out that there is a long way from the American tart to that piece of shit. It's not even a comedy, it's more like a really bad documentary. Not only the story is bad, the picture and sound suck. They sit in alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunk teens. And the result is a disaster. if you see this movie don't buy it, rather spend your money on something else and better. If you torture yourself, do not invite your friend / s unless you hate much and you want to get rid of them.
