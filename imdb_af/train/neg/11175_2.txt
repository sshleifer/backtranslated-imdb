Unless someone relieves me, I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it's far from it. This movie tells sensible story of a press agency in New York and its problems. And that's basically everything. When the agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it should be something important. But it's not hard to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year. The other is Simone, who earned the title "the most boring and sensible film of the year". So what's going on, Al?
