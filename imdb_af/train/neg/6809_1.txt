One Stinko of a movie with a shopping worm plot and, kindly, acting less than Oscar caliber. But for me the only worst mistake was the total misrepresentation of a jet plane, and especially a 747. Some of the big blunders: <br /> <br /> 1. No flight engineer (or even a flight engineer station.) 2 Misidentification of the F-16 interceptors as F-15s (no resmblance whatsoever). 3. Charging passengers in a "back-luggage compartment" that is supposedly accessible from the cabin. Such a compartment exists and places so much weight that will make the aircraft far behind the plane. 4. Point of view bullets that "will not damage the aircraft". 5. The whole landing procedure was so bad I wanted to break. SR-71 (of all aircraft) with a pressure seal hatch 7. Open a cab door to the outside - in the wind - in flight !! <br /> <br /> It was just a real movie. the list of the bottom 10 of the year.
