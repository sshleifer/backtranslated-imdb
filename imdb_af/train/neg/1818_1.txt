Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and is sometimes attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, people. The only reason for even considering whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These 70s sewage period pieces are sometimes entertaining because of their very dated (bloated pants, big hair, Zapata mustaches, etc.). This one is not. <br /> <br /> The writing is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​a senior citizen-romantic leading man is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The title, which indicates a sex comedy, is very misleading. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this one like the plague.
