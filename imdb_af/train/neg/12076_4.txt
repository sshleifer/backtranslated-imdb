You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "to be or not to be" (not the speech itself) has been hit so many times that it is not very interesting (in fact, it wasn't so good not to start with). In fact, I find "Hamlet" a good but very over-rated game. It's not even Shakespeare's best: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with a Midsummer Night's Dream "and" Othello "not too far behind." Macbeth (knocking your table out of his drawers , puck will fix, OW!) "Also not so bad. There are many others that are better than Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> I won't really comment too much on the movie, but I will dissect the totally horrible MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> Okay ... Mike and the Bots win a card game, get the movie ... they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda ... and prepare for the most boring Sci-Fi episode of MST3K ever (admittedly, I haven't seen any of the CCs). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters or Dr. Z "its viewing episode terribly, since it's not really a movie, rather random, split screens (I'm reminded of Mike's line of" Future War ":" Maybe it's an anthology of short, inexorable movies ", the SOL Crew a lot got very good cracks. Can't say the same here. <br /> <br /> The riffs fall flat, the gas segments (usually) are at best mediocre and when the movie itself ( what is not so bad is actually BETTER (I mean, as a quality movie, not as a camp, like "Prince of Space") as its MST3K version, you know the show should be bad. laughed (the last time I saw it a few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times throughout, I tried and tried and tried to be entertained - but I just couldn't. line, like "Hail Queen Dilbert's boss!" (and when it's the funniest line of the episode, well, ahem) - and sometimes I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe I'm even scared. The second time I tried to look at it, I didn't even laugh at the few jokes I had previously found and just gave up forty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie is not terrible; It's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough and although the dubbing is not the greatest, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY, MST3K!
