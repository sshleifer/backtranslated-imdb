Don't let the MPA trick you with their "Valued R for extreme violence". There is certainly no extreme force in this boring piece of s * t. I did expect some inexpensive Rambo 3 action that the trailer promised, but it's just boring, boring nonsense, with tons of delayed Mo flashbacks that don't make sense. AVOID!
