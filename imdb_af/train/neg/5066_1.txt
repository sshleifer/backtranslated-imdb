This is the worst show. Buntch of grown up acted like children no humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has better humor and more mature than friends. "Friends" can be the worst thing I've ever seen on television and I sat in front of the tube. series. It lacks the cunning of Seinfeld and the wonderful self-indulgence of pumping that is the hallmark of "Frasier". The characters in "Friends" look designed to make their apostate dullards. This turbulent group of neighbors crawls my flesh. <br /> <br /> The relentless performance is completely without any appearance. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is somomomic - even if it is deliberate. (It may be interesting to observe a writing session since the authors must have slave to lower their ability to not confuse the loyal friends of "friends".)
