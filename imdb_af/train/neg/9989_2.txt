I had the misfortune to watch this litter on Sky Cinema Max in a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just trash. This one is even worse: it is one of the dumbest pieces of shit I've ever seen in my life. Horror movie? Yes, there are terrible things in this: the acting, the screenplay and the special effects - Oh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a movie for 90 minutes. Actually, if it was a comic movie, I'd give it a 5. Don't even consider renting it unless you want to mock the producers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 - don't have one voice because it makes me laugh all the time ;-)
