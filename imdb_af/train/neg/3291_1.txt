First, let me say I'm not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looks like Reg and Order. The worst was the cast of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, If they ever watched the show, Roscoe was not a hard ass. He was more of a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with the usual bugs, cars are torn and continues as nothing happened. The worst example is when the general comes with Billy Prickett, and the general ran into a dirt hill that stops, but continues to win the race.
