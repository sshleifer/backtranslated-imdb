If you have seen friends, the writing will be well known. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy setup. <br /> <br /> The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were quite young (I think about 10 years old). Now they are in the middle of the twenties, and they meet again at a class reunion. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with several story lines simultaneously. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut into several sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> The sketches are where my problems with this series lie. As in the later seasons of Friends, it is often a pretty setting with difficult situations. One of the main characters is doing something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is then very exaggerated, as if it wasn't stupid enough. If you are in this kind of humor in your face, then you might like this series. For me, this is a big turn-off. <br /> <br /> The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that make you root for the characters. The Class has nothing of this. The characters are simple to force and stereotypes are pushed too far. So it is not possible to keep with them and to have them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the traits are all rolled out. But in class, it looks like it's been steaming before it even started.
