As an independent filmmaker and a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I purchased this documentary and believed it would ultimately put the record straight on how talented and brilliant Ed Wood was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing, self-centered, conflicting, contradictory compilation of bitterly contradictory habits. <br /> <br /> Where People Ed Wood Jr. remember, do people actually remember the second cousin of the man with the band someone knows who was in Plan Nine? From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems as if the moment there is a new interest in Ed Wood, these people come from the "Wood" work! Just take moderate swipes from someone who actually gave them a chance if no one else would! After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people should get rid of the fact that they didn't get the $ 75 they promised. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant, creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In fact, it was ALL he lived at. You can giggle when you see Ed's movies, but somehow you're aware that you're laughing at him and not at him. <br /> <br /> But I split ... Back to the movie at hand. If You Have A Movie About Edward D. Wood Jr. expect, you won't find it here. If you want a movie about cranky bitter old actors, this is the movie for you!
