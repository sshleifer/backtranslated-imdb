Have I ever seen a movie more shocking? I can think of many as equal to this one, but no one can overcome it. The role players are all horrible stereotypes associated with a flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved in making this. Each carries an expression of fear that is not generated by the plot, but by the realization that this project can easily nix their career. Even the very charm of me. Diaz does not give enough reason to submit to this. Avoid, of course, it's a movie style that Americans don't really understand. Look at the final result if you have to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but don't say I didn't warn you ...
