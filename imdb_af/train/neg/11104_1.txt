I'm not one of those people who just go online after watching a movie and decide to name it the worst movie ever made. If you have any doubts, please check out my other reviews. But for the first time I saw a movie so terribly what I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good. However, there is not a good thing I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically non-existent. If someone reads my review, they waste their money to see it, they can discern what the plot may be, but I advise you that a nickel is worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. <br /> <br /> The two slides are attractive, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but I invite someone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask my opinion about this movie before they get a dime spilling game. I'll tell you something. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, and I love horror and I like new inventive movies. I even like horror porn stuff like Hostel (What some reviewers say it was like, but of course they just thought so Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But it could be the number 1 most worthless and dumb and dumbass movie ever made. <br /> <br /> And before ignoring this review, it comes from someone who has not just sat down by the ONLY premiere of the House of the Dead. , but actually bought a copy of it.
