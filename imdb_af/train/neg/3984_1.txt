I watched this movie a few years back on the BBC I was sitting there. How? I don't know, it's a way to be there in the "so bad" Good Charts Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman when they see it now. I think Woody Allen would have been miracles with the foreign plot, and Baldwin could have played part with flight by Leslie Nelson. It was tonight again, I tried to see it again, but life is too short. The few minutes I watched were for the lovely Nicole she was so nice at 93, has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman has played his stock in the trade, "nice but dull character" that comes out of the F word when his wife of "phraser" miscasts as a detective accuses him of murdering sounds. stay well away.
