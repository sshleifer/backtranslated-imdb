Watching this movie, I always thought; Why do they make such a problem out of some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed, the authors least thought of a good reason why the car could not stop. <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this movie; all the usual narrative cliches make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is licking like a sieve etc. It makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
