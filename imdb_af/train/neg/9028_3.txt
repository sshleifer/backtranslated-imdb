I just watched this movie and I have to say it with such a good starting point and good talent, this turkey is just there !!! A friend lent me this movie and I watched with an open mind, mainly because he had such a high praise for the story. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot retiring ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He is allegedly hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot. Well, we never see Costner flying near the plane! <br /> <br /> Costner runs a Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner tags for a ride. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is beaten and Costner drives him to the meeting, which happens to a Quinn co-worker! But nothing comes of it ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have Gammon's character? Why did they have the horse sales with the Quinn associate if there was nothing to do with it? <br /> <br /> After leaving Costner for death, they make Madeline Stowe's character a whore, and then she attacks one of Quinn's men who pay a turn. She stabbed him with his own knife, And the next thing she moved to a monastery! No explanation why she was moved or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent is wasted on such poor writing and poor editing !! I just watched it because a friend owned it and I watched it. I'm gonna throw it to him for the 2 hours I've been wasting my life and look at the exploded thing!
