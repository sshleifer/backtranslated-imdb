I am Irish and I live in Denmark for a while. Looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission. And I will say on record: <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS COMPLETED. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, like "The Fertile Man in Ireland", but it's definitely not there with other Irish movies like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins . <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are actually pretty funny, like Colm Meaneys American style garda. But the movie itself was shot completely wrong. Reflecting the camera and zooming in, zooming out, trying to give the movie a fiery look as if it were a dramatic drama. But it is not. It is an Irish lock, stock and two smoking barrels, and it must be shot so. It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next. The movie just looks sloppy and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The shows are okay, with the terrible writing. A friend of mine told me it looked like they had just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He does a decent performance as a Dublin Dirtbag, but is not comparable to his appearances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman recently baptized by her bank manager husband for a younger woman. I think she should leave her god-horrible stand-up and focus more on her play. <br /> <br /> All in all, she has no way of meeting the expectations of the Irish press, or deserves to be regarded as one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> <br /> I expect a setback from these comments because most people I spoke to said it was wonderful. But before you answer, ask yourself: Would it be so high of this movie if it is set in England or America?
