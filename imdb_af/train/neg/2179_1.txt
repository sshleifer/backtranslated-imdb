I just loved seeing it all and having fun with the total bad of a movie. I watched this movie through the useful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. Turning to the other side of the DVD shows them the real movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, people are grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The acting, special effects and plot in general are very cheesy and unrealistic. "Doesn't she need lungs?" Crow said how the head could still speak while it didn't have a body, and Tom Servo pointed out just plainly: "No, she has neck juice!". The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. That "Meow" after the fight or scene, whatever, was classic. So, in some ways it was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you will probably enjoy it. For a good time, look at the MSTK3 version, you'll get a good laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10
