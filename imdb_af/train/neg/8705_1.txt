This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... it's humorous how bad it is. All the time I watched it. I half expected music to start and the doctor to dance. (I saw pornography with a better plot) When the raptor tried to get in the door, I think someone throws a plastic doll at the door about 2 feet away. But as I said it is so bad, you should see it so you can see how bad it is, I explain it will do nothing compared to seeing it. I do not recommend renting it, but when it comes to TV, it only takes about 30 minutes to see what I mean. I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit through the whole thing, you have good willpower
