This movie was terribly terrible. The acting was the worst! It was worse than a student life. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, it's a good old movie. Then I remembered that it was no excuse! I saw older movies with better performances and such. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really messy. The editing was poor (most of the dialogue wasn't synced.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie doesn't even earn a 1. I just watched it because I was so bored and the movie almost entertained has. me. It was just laughing. My dead grandmother's left little finger can make a better movie than that.
