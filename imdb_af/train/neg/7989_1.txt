I had high expectations of "My Beautiful Laundry", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The history of British Asians who fit in with their adopted home has very good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio shows (Goodness, Gracious, etc.). This one fell flat. Despite a good start, it quickly went up the hill. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it was a terribly typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, overwhelming characters, a day game and a soundtrack. many "issues" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I got myself on many points during this movie. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche has been pulled out and broadcast. In fact, I have problems thinking of any cross-cultural / cross-generation devices that could have been used. The characters were thin and clicked: the eccentric non-conform minister; the good meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the overweight, communicable aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the worker's neighbor; the 'wise' profound granny; the motorcycle rider. The writing was poor, with every chance of shocking the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimensions of racist white characters. And why it had to be in the 70's (apart from an excuse for a 70's soundtrack) is a mystery. Perhaps it makes incredible characters slightly more credible for people born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Aside from these things, good acting can carry it to reverent darkness. Instead, the usual "BBC comedy" suspects are wheeling it out. "Moving like Beckham" had much better comic acting (and seriously acting) than that, with a virtually unknown role. <br /> <br /> In summary, a lazy cliched script, about-done, in a dull predictable story. Give it a miss. <br /> <br />
