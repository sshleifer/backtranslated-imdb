I've heard from this novel a long time ago, many of my friends recommended reading it. I searched it in every place and finally found it. This is a book that every person must read, because it is genius and because of his vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and couldn't wait to see it. When I finally was, I was very disappointed. Many things in the book aren't in the movie (I don't think it's a spoiler), which just doesn't make the movie logical. Michael Radford can be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as a book initiator. The movie is not dark at all, the writing is really bad. The only thing that is good, even great, is the play. John Hurt is a wonderful actor and the only face I could see as Winston Smith myself. <br /> <br /> As far as I am concerned, the people in IMDb called this "The Best Adaptation Ever" without first reading the book! Or know anything about screenwriters! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the shine of the story by reading the book, don't consider it an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this movie are for the play.
