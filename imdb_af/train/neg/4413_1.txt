Wide enough for you? Wait until you see this petty <br /> <br /> adaptation of a small college one act. What is shocking and wild in <br /> <br /> College rarely holds time, and that's proof. To tackle the <br /> <br /> Catholic Church with broadside humor is just not shocking or <br /> <br /> interesting or funny, it's so boring. The artists are all <br /> <br /> playing and giving everything they have, but it's basically a play that doesn't open <br /> <br />. Not much fun.
