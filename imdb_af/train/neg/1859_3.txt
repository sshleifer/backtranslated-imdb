Son this movie has deceived me. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror movie with absolutely no humor in it, boy, I had that cold shoulder that time. This movie was, and I'm truth, pretty damn good. It wasn't terrifying, but the camaraderie and the wicked humor are really angry at this movie. Some of the horrible acting and clich√© murders were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The murders are all vaguely related to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more interesting. The POV camera angles were great. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to jail. He is later raised in the same chemical substance with snow split into the mixture. These are the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He, as the snowman, takes his revenge on the police officer who found him guilty. <br /> <br /> This movie had such a bad performance, with the exception of Christopher Allport, it was funny. I will say that I am also disappointed that this movie was not a horror, but actually a dark sitcom. They had a good story with a good plot, but it wasn't done right. All in all, I like the movie first, but now it's really annoying. But this movie is better and darker than its successor.
