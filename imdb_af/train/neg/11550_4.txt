I knew I was going to see a low budget movie, but I expected a lot more from an Alex Cox movie. The actions of the two leading men were terrible, especially the white man. The girl had to win an Oscar compared to the two. This movie was filled with what I think would be in jokes for movie industry people and some other jokes I actually understand and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these laugh-out-loud moments I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to the Alex Cox who made all the 80's classics? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a few questions I had after the movie was over. Why did the Mexican man go to the other's house at the beginning? What did his daughter say he fired 100 people from his last job? Why did she break her own good when she was angry with him? I think I had to go to the movie to the Q&A, but I didn't want to get up at 10:00.
