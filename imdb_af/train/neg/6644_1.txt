Yes he is! ... No, not because of Pintilie, likes to pull out his actors and make their belongings public. Pintilie IS the naked "emperor" - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It's time for someone to explain the truth. This cheater is a voyeur, locked up in an old man's body. His abundance of naaktonele has no artistic legitimacy whatsoever. It is 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by dropping the actors into the dull and watching their wills. And if he does this before the audience, he might get a hard touch! Did you know that, on the set of "Niki Ardelean", he embarrassed bad Coca-Blossie by telling her: "Oh, Coca, how do I want you!" She is a good lady, very decent and sensitive, and she has become indescribably shy - to his petty satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Roem English audiences, so many people are so foolish at declaring these visual obscenities "artworks"! Will anyone ever have the decency to expose the truth of it all?
