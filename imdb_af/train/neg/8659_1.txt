There are a few things I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I were to create a very cheap and foolish Dino and Crocodile polygon model in Maya and then cut and paste it into an amateur video clip, with people screaming and eating through the same thing? How can anyone even believe that a completely false CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place will affect the events in this movie? I know that his B grade, low budget and all but the producers can do better than making a piece of shit nobody has ever seen or seen. It just does not make sense. Are people really so stupid that they sit down? Apparently so. For laughs? No, this thing is not even worth laughing at.
