Years after the fall of the last major corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark era where cyborgs are being harvested for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a country doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. On the run of Recyclers (bounty hunters hunting cyborgs), Cash tries her way to Cytown, the mythical retreat for cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (and last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a successor to Masters of the University, but was quickly rewritten in a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts festival which, due to its case-like action scenes, became something of a cult classic. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a successor who actually improved on his predecessor but was not widely seen (and was dismissed by the few who saw it as cheap feed). <br /> <br /> This movie, for one thing, tries to be the first two movies (the first was a cheesy action movie, while the second was a clever Cyberpunk story), but unfortunately it both falls on scores. Of course, the budget was lower than CYBORG 2, with the desert desert movie (such as so many post-apocalyptic action films of the 90's), the old industrial buildings shot to save costs. <br /> <br /> The movie's story is based on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, which is as interesting as it is absurd (this movie is not the first to try the idea , the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same trap that so many low-budget scientific films touch the victim, as the night (synthetic organisms) is nothing more than androids. The visual effects are nothing more than prosthetic arms and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> The play is fairly standard for this kind of movie, with the main actress (Khrystyne Haje) the only worst performer. Instead of being joyful about the news, she's pregnant, she shines and giggles. Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell is the regular gangster type who looks the scene he appears to be, and Richard Lynch has fun as the main band. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, Lynch's right hand, who later appeared in The Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake and his prequel.
