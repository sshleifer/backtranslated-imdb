This movie is beautiful to watch, but is like a very bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) doesn't make sense. But it is very "artistic". Many shots of half-dressed actors struggle and look deep into each other's eyes. Lots of shots through windows and with people outside the frame. Mumbling and people wandering erratically. Long-lasting close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you get to the three-room roof top with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be about a father and son's relationship, but you'd just wish the two of them would just get f * $ and get each other. If you always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish was granted.
