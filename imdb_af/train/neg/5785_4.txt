VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated mansion inhabited by Two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) are named in their generous sexual lifestyle, but his hosts seem to be vampires with a frantic desire for human blood ... <br /> <br /> With his clues From the lesbian vampire cycle by mrs. Jean Rollin in France initiated and consolidated by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, spectacular shocker Jose Ramon Larraz pushed the concept of Mature Horror much further than British sensors were prepared to tolerate in 1974 , and his film was cut on his original British edition with almost three minutes. It's not hard to see why! Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as mere background to a cunning meditation. Using his Gothic theme as the pretext for so much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the movie's short run time will allow. on life, death and impulses - sexually and otherwise - confirming the human condition. <br /> <br /> In the autumn of 1973, a spectacular atmosphere of Harry Waxman was shot at a picturesque mansion. , in which the deserted countryside - dark and beautiful in equal measure - presents a storm of threatening terror (Larraz hit a similar trick earlier this year with SYMPTOME, a low-key thriller in the final of the final violence in the finals) outbreak rule). However, despite the predictions, VAMPYRES wafer points and coarse production values ​​will be divided from the outset. Although the two female protagonists are as charismatic and attractive as desired, the male head (Brown, his first at the time of filming) is desperately dubious in a role that had to go to a beautiful twentysomething stud. A must-see item for cult movie fans, an amusing curio for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Watch out for the silent era superstar Bessie Love in a short como at the end of the movie.
