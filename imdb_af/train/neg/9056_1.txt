I've seen some crazy movies in my life, but this one has to be the worst. We follow two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron). as sweets) in one car on a road trip to Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not too happy with his sex life, so he cheats his wife with Candy, who at least tries to have a baby. . Meanwhile, Roy is not sure if his sperm is good, so he gets it checked by a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now I read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend didn't and she burst out after about 20 minutes: 'Oh yes, she's going to get pregnant, but her husband can't have babies. ' Spot on as this movie is so predictable. As well as boring. And irritating. Meaninglessness. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples arrived in Nevada in their big car when they were stopped by 2 police officers as they did not stop at a stop sign. The guys know each other and eventually the two officers convert a case of beer. Not only is this scene meaningless and not important (or even relevant) to the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and talking, without ever going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to think about the end. Apparently, Roy has NO problems there, so he is the father of the child. How many times does it happen in the movies ... try something new! The cheated woman eventually forgives her husband and best friend for the cause and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the movie is right at the end, with a few shots of the Grand Canyon. Why can't they keep the camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> One would expect more from this result (though Thornton really tries), but you can't really blame them. Writers, you ashamed! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
