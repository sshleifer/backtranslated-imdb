In this movie, Joe Pesci slams dunks a basketball. Joe Pesci ... <br /> <br /> and is consistent, the rest of the writing is not as credible. <br /> <br /> pesci is a funny man who saves this movie from slipping the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who appreciated more money than people, who didn't even play well. Instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he looked more like an amoral android programmed to earn money at all costs. then there is the token assigned to pesci as a girl or something ... I don't even remember ... she was so forgetful. <br /> <br /> Anyone who runs this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some movie studio trying to improve the reputation of this sank movie, or at least one of those millions of media minions that can't effectively criticize (you know the people who feel bad if they give something under 6). <br /> <br /> Stay away ... far away. and embarrassed at the comedy center, where I saw this movie. they usually choose better.
