Maybe I saw one too much crime spot, or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> It was the most clich√©-ridden, plot-absent, plot-absurd, but just silly movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> In terms of direction, it seems that it took less time to show it than it did to put it together. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like making it straight to the video before it's finished. <br /> <br /> It's a bad finishing of "M" the classic Fritz Lang movie with Peter Lorre. You'll be so much better off renting it.
