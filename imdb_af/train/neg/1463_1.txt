Just think of the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would be such a murder murder as Carlyle portrayed him in this movie. No one would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed man in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> It's just a Hollywood cardboard propaganda piece, disguised as "true history." <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for anyone who actually believed in this show. Carlyle and the producers have done nothing about this. <br /> <br /> Why was Hitler so many people, a whole country for his ideas, if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as such, they make their own movie totally incredible. This film is a mix of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill where the director shows him for 90 minutes as a drunkard. <br /> <br /> This film is a shame and I wonder how they can talk to an actor like Carlyle in this drink.
