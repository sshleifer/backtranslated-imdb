The Maria Mrs. Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who invents her husband (Fedja van Huet) is fraud on her, but she does not 'dare not confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with people, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all. We know nothing about her background or her motivation. Just a woman who seems to be in a blind spot, not just during this difficult episode of her life. Of course she suffers from something, but why do we have to suffer in the audience as well? <br /> <br /> I almost got up at the theater after seeing this unsteady mess. It was a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid energy with the bad movies. I will beat and roll, but in this case there is a fair warning. How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding (mainly from public funds) for this turkey? It was clear that there was no writing to talk about. This can be compensated by an ingenious film maker with cinematic ideas or a cast with just a little more appeal. Nothing at all, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something about a woman's point of view". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is no interesting shot in the whole movie. I can't think of a pot that scratched this one, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this serious lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold Maria Kraakman tried to direct: "Mary, look at the horizon, we will film you for three minutes, just grief". A perfect cure for insomnia. Get a copy and watch it late at night, guaranteed to let you sleep too. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
