I'm not from America and I know what 'women's exchange' is. When a show came from that name, I was excited to see some cool, glamorous sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real struggle of folly. I was misjudged with his title name, it has no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogue. (Halldekanaal threw a wide variety, and I think they worked out / mute such content to make it neat.) <br /> <br /> A show that gives a picture of current American / Western family-run, overweight blunt people, polluted teenagers, and their sucking family outings. In each episode, two women / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each other's home and change their family routine again with their new own rule. Sometimes it seems good or even worse. At the end of each section, everyone is brought back with their husband and tries to decide what they have been doing to each family over the past few days. This is the suction part of the program where every contender fights for their rights. I'm sucked to see all these things instead of seeing some cool adult sex for adults. I mean who made this program more than what called "Wife Swap"; it is better to be called "mother exchange". All in all, it damages all the great things that the real woman is exchanging for! <br /> <br /> Woman exchange = Average glance watch.
