As the faux-Russian scientist says two-thirds of the way in the film, I came to science. It pretty much calls it the reason I watched this movie - anything about a half-man, half-hammer shark, definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation by an impartial aspiring scientist. Or, as they say in the biz, my friend's brother has the remote and the rest is history. To say the special effects were bad, would be a special effects disorder. It's 2005, it's not that difficult to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background. Yes, it was beautiful and top of the art when Hitchcock filmed the "The Birds", but in 2005 it just looks like a low budget. Save me the cheap attempt at Sci-Fi and do the service to actually make an effort to defend the willing suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> But I seriously blamed the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you. Again, it's as sad as it may sound, it's probably worth it. If it's nothing else, it's a bad Sci-Fi tournament - the training for the new movie cache is worth it and is definitely worth a refresher course for those who have seen some movies in their day. <br /> <br /> The crazy bad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to rinse good blood in nearby water not only makes me the intelligence of mankind, but also the ability of the B film writers to come forth. distance probable plot lines. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is one of my long-time movie talks - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't 2005, I'd be deadset about the fact that this movie was a kind of bad poor metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon bird that contains leaks in Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists the Charlton Heston lookalike, "waiting for Tom" as he tries to lift the escape helicopter off the ground. The thing is, Tom spills the bad sunglasses guys with his never-ending banana stone attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, in the layman's terms. <br /> <br /> Like the mad scientist near the end of the movie, "my goal is to develop the human species" - it is enough to say that this movie only contributed to a devolution of humanity . The vague Freudian references spoken by the mad scientist while preparing the female protagonist to accompany a hammerhead shark is a simple reminder that even in the worst science fiction we can all get something to laugh about.
