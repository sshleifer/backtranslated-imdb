I saw it a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie is supposed to be funny, it's not a single laugh in the theater (maybe for jos√© garcia and Gerard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. It was even difficult to understand what they were saying. They only speak fast and do not make enough to understand us. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself and said to a line that was supposed to be funny "what, what did he say", and I'm French. I hate to say that, because I think good movies are made here, but I apologize to all the foreigners who are going to watch the movie (if ever it is outside France). <br /> <br /> We are very sorry for the cr @ p. 10/02
