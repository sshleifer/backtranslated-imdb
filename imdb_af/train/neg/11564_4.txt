Italian horror / tension film about a rich English gentleman crossing pubs and taverns for girls with red hair, like his recent late wife, Evelyn. You know he really needs to love his wife, because he brings them to his home - a big rotting castle - and troubles them and teases them, sweeps them and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this movie for me was that somehow through the film's end, this man is played by Antonio De Teffe as the hero of the movie. Anyway, under the advice of his cute Roberto Maldera, De Teffe will meet with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen with De Beffe's fragile state of mind. He starts to see and hear his dead wife and finally, just look at the title if you're still curious. Also, family and friends are beginning to die in the most brutal modes. Poor aunt Agatha (she looks like she is even younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old), meets her fate in a frivolous way. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a full explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does pretty well: the institutions in the movie are well-suited to this movie, but try to make us believe that England is at best ridiculous. None of the actors watch English. Many people have dark black hair and Mediterranean complexion and an Englishman does not wear clothes. The cars are on the wrong side of the road. But all that is attached to it is the cryptone scene shot effectively and I also like the cute resolution. And of course, a movie with the wobbly, red head Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; However, I got a bit appalled at the idea that women were torturing well and well to relieve one of his spiritual demons. C'mon.
