Okay. So I just came back. Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to keep this movie. I know I was negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out like the movie. I didn't do this. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every horror clich√© is conceivable in it. And it's not just the fact that they make every little thing in a fright (walk in a baseball bat standing on the floor? Do you treasure me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing I was surprised at was that there was more blood than I thought there would be. It doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Donna taken by Lisa's mom at her. house. She comes in. Go upstairs. Camera pans dead to her dad on the couch. Eerie. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene takes place. Find her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how can she tell? He didn't have a spot on him). Killer comes in, Donna hides under the bed, mother dies. She walks outside and screams for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut after therapy session. It confused many people - everyone asked if her family had died or if she had suggested it - and she mentioned how the nightmares were coming back. Filler dialog follows. <br /> <br /> They cut as fast as possible. Some scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason he escaped 3 days ago, but the police / family were not informed until he was already there). More filler ensues. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go over what happens in the movie because I don't want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan has already made a message about it. But on the subject of death: they were not so exciting. People in the theater actually laughed out loud (an experience I've never had in a horror movie, even when a stranger calls) during several of them. One of the special: the bus boy who gives the most hilarious "scary" face I've ever seen. The only death that had blood was Lisa, and it was pretty scarce. Her throat was cut, blood (if you could even call it - it was almost black) splashing on the curtain thing. The only other blood was on Claire when we saw her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after killing her. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clicks I've ever seen. Let's see here .. mandatory mirror curtain-BOOM! scene. Cheque. Twice, actually (you can say they are struggling). Compulsory back-up killer. Cheque. There is also the backup-in-lamp scene, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want to scare a bird's eye? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to include one of these). And of course, the security-on-all-exits-but-yet-escaped scene. Will I continue? I can. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says the characters were not stupid, are you joking? "Oh, although the massive alarm is ringing, literally spreading the building, and 3 of my friends missing, I'm going upstairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only nice character - Lisa - made one of the dumbest moves in the movie. "Oh, I just realized that the psycho teacher is here! I have to leave my strong boyfriend to let myself go to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator goes slow? Guess I'll take the stairs and run into the construction site! "Ugh. By the end of the movie they all deserved to die. The only death that had any regrets was Donna's boyfriend (I can't even remember his name - is it bad?), And by that time, the audience was completely rid of the scarce, clipped movie. <br /> <br /> There were some positive-the plays were largely decent, and it was well shot. But it's about it. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1/5, and it's generous. Just for the laugh (and believe me, the audience has a few), and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the response was bad. Very bad. People were booing after the movie ended and buzz was then very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.
