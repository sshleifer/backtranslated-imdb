I will not add to the plot reviews. It's not very good. <br /> <br /> Very unlikely orphanage at Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br /> A beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> Good for facial, and I quote, "look at the mouth, this is Cassie of fools and horses." <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Restore feature? It was free to watch the Horror channel before switching to subscription. I will not enter this attempt.
