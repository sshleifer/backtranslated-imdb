"Increase Victor Vargas" is one of those lights, family flies you can see and the N.Y. Do Times Crossword at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona, you don't have to "pause" the DVD. Just roll it, because you won't lose anything really important. No turns, turns or tension. It's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that is Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. I've seen it a few times before. Just connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family or an Irish family. Only the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family called Bush or Clinton and was Presbyterian, the movie would be a total snooze. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics can't really get the rural area here. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some of the Bronx, and another Brooklyn. As a lifelong New Yorker, I agree to the Lower East Side. And it seems the family never met anyone other than Latin. They lived in an isolated / isolated small enclosure. Some interaction with non-Latinos may have created an excitement, interest or tension. Remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> Now for the often criticized cinematography. I don't know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots looked to me VERY ORANGE. The appetite, the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE. What was that supposed to mean? And the appetite. scratched me pretty. Someone mentioned here that the old apartments had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What owners have done is to break one big appetite into 2 or 3 little ones and push as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing ... This is the second family movie I saw and criticized this week. Is this private sex law essential for us to watch? Please save me! How about these directors? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was nice for a change to see that young Latino actors gave a break and a chance to show their talents, what they did. But the writers leave them and give them a flat, unforeseen writing to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the "forward" button.
