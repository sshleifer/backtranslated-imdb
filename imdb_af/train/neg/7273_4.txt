This early role for Barbara Shelley (in fact, her first in Britain after she worked in Italy) was when she was 24 years old and it is definitely safe to say that she made an excellent debut in 1957's "Cat Girl". While blondes and brunette get the most attention (I'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard), the beautiful auburn actress with the deep voice has always chased intelligence as well as vulnerability (one example of which is 1960's "Village of the Damned" in which her screen time was less than her character's husband, George Sanders.) She is the only reason to see this cat-people kill update, and is perceived as a major advantage (it's hard to tell whether her beauty is a draw found it better showcase). His character apparently sleeps in the nude, and we are exposed to her nice bare back when she wakes up (also exposed 8 years later in 1965's Rasputin-The Mad Monk). The overwhelming gown carries the most of her the movie is a wonderful strapless wonder (I don't see how it keeps dressing, but I like it). Overall, it proves positively that Barbara Shelley, in a poorly written role that most actresses will defeat, rises above her material and makes the film consistently viewable, a real test of strength, which she will soon attend at Hammer's studios in Bray for the duration of would find the 1960s.
