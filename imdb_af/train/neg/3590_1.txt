How low can someone sink while trying to regain an old glory? ST: HF would love to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing what has been made for a good Star Trek show, it should NOT be watched. <br /> <br /> The writing is hodge -Podge, the actors depicting their characters poorly, and most importantly, the design work is straight doggy. <br /> <br /> Like watching strong chiefs, don't look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget it here! Star Fleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair. <br /> <br /> While a seemingly mentally weak captain is pushing over within two minutes of the opening program's credits, Ensign's Spikey is trying to arrange an engineer test. It just humiliates from there. No, not even uniforms fit, for the sake of good. They are too small or too big, crabs to their coffins, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The rigorous discipline and tradition of any of the original deficiencies in this production up to the stairs! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which improved a little with each season. OK, I'll take it back. Who uses CG inexperienced? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Don't save it, it will violate your Star Trek sentence as it did mine. Not even throwing back to previous shows can save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I was openly crying when I watched it, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost burst. So bad.
