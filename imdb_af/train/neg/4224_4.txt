STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Miss the Mark *** There's a Little Inside ** Laugh Behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> In this debut attempt for Nick Park's loved one man and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace walks out of cheese. <br /> <br /> Besides the shortest function in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the earliest and it shows as well. The plasticine animation is a bit creepy and funny here, reminiscent of the Mork animation about the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Properly, though the craftsmanship is behind, I've never really been in Wallace & Gromit (maybe a little too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I really enjoyed, is The Wrong Trousers (and it was more when I was younger and less aware of, we will say the sweet pleasure of life.) I was dedicated to actively seeking out this early effort because of the revival in popularity. of the highly successful recent film adaptation. <br /> <br /> As technically impressive as the first two (all consider things!) this one does not have the emotional angle his successors had to own. That said, it's pretty good fun as a first three and definitely the standard for bigger things to come. Two stars, but a good two stars. **
