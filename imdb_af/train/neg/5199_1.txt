In the first 20 minutes each click may have been thrown out by the hack writer and director. There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically-tortured NTSB board member played by [I can kill any TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of a victim; and the bad ambulance-hunting lawyer. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no concept of aircraft fragility. The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly on the ground like a hippo that decided to take a nap. The first third of the hull was intact, the rear half of the aircraft was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most of the people had fled away in view of how many people survived the plane that had blinked in Iowa after losing its hydraulics. Most of these TV planes are not even burned. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the scene in "Air Force One" where the 747 touches the water and then overflows as it is made of inch thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who accepted more than me, was commenting on technical flaws. What amazed me was how this POS could ever be made. Are the producers of these things so used to cliches that they can't even recognize them? Someone read this script and said, "Yes, I want to spend a million dollars really making it." I wish I was the man's next appointment. I have the title for a wonderful bridge in New York that I will sell cheaply.
