It's one of the most hateful and brutal movies I've seen in the past. Unfortunately, I am sued to stick to it, as Donald Sutherland's misleading presence made it credible. [This is the last time that will happen.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's character was annoyingly whiny and stupid as they came. There were smarter characters than her murdered in the movie. It's just one of the many things in this movie that made me ask, "Where is justice?" Why is the nightmare so filled with sadistic rubbish filled with pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on those who are terrorizing and murdering. This movie could have been so exciting without being ill and turned around. All it does eventually is to change the viewer's stomach with his disease and insult the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> The cast is misleadingly good. My guess is that they first baked Sutherland and used it to lure the others like lemmings. <br /> <br /> I'm kicking myself for the waste of time, giving this piece of garbage a chance.
