It's a fascinating horrible movie. It makes so little sense that it starts a kind of strange internal logic on its own. Well, if it didn't dry up the sidewalks, it would eventually hit the weight of its own impudence. The movie can't keep in mind whether it's a straight forward 'Man Turns Into Monster' flick (like all the sixties' ING MAN's films) OR an abominable story-conspiracy movie or a mystical post life contact story, or ... or what? Make your choice. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and firing in all directions, leaving loose points completely over the place. It was as if Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch pills. Unfortunately, he didn't take enough.
