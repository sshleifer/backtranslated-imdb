Just write that one bag, but it's really. I love the gangster genre and it's the worst entry I've seen in recent years. I praise everyone who is involved in most aspects, except the most important one, the writing. It's a bad story about a small criminal. No amount of fine or black and white film styling can make up for a complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he's going to do another movie about the general. My advice is not wasting your time.
