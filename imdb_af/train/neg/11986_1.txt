What horrible writing and acting. No personality. What can't you make a good movie with a single character? Hmm, it's done in Castaway with self-dialogue. <br /> <br /> So, this kid is traveling to see his dad. The child, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies in the middle of the flight. So the child clashes in a lake and survives. Then he walks around, survives in the desert until he is saved. <br /> <br /> During that time he fights twice a bear. The first time he fights it in the lake. The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spreads the bear. Two shots of false blood flushing from the chest's chest reminded me of Monty Python's "The Holy Grail". <br /> <br /> The child also decides to kick a stork pig with predictable results. <br /> <br /> gag.
