"Dominique" is one of those films for which the expression "slow-as-molasses" must be invented. Too many endless and repetitive rows (how many times do we see Robertson slowly in the stairs because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is only redeemed by a surprising twist, which is unfortunately followed by a second twist that only manages to leave a bad taste in our mouth. Not a very nice movie.
