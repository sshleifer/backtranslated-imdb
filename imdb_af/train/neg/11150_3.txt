I watched this movie alone, in the dark, and it was full moon outside! I didn't deliberately do it, it just happened. So all the elements were there for this movie to scare hell out of me !! Well, it didn't, I actually wanted to close the DVD player after just 8 minutes, but I thought it was a chance, unfortunately I did. The acting was terrible, the only one with a decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a horror fan, it's just the same stuff you've seen many times. Some scenes didn't make sense at all, and you just got the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The (scary) scenes seemed to belong to a horror movie from the 80's, when there wasn't enough technology, yet good movies were made! I was surprised to see the name of a large production company at the start of the movie, I thought they couldn't make money in this option and make it decent? !! I couldn't agree with the ratings the movie received, it's also my rating for it, 3 out of 10.
