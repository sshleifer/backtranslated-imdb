I just watched The Convent for the second time. I enjoyed it before and thought it would make for a good drunken Friday night movie, a little gore, a little style, some humor and so on. I was sad to find that I didn't appreciate it much anymore. It looked as if someone had been challenging to visit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original one worthwhile. For the record I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there were a few things I really dug up. The monastery does the cheese, but not the goodness. Aside from Joanna Canton's likeable performance, the gaai girl and a sweet from Adrienne Barbeau came, and almost all the characters were indifferent, holding onto the absolute lowest levels of moronic, offensive jockhood. The film is then severely hampered by the total lack of free nudity, which means that the difficult dialogue is difficult to see the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the movie. The evil nuns are originally in the design and get very good scenes, though they are not sorry, they are probably so cool, and the movie also has a good amount of neat gore. By the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene, the movie becomes quite entertaining, because all the petty people are dead and it is an evil non-bashing madness. The stylized direction also occasionally produces good results, although the camera is just moving too fast. All in all, it was a movie where for me the bright points just can't make up for the things I hated. Those who love this kind of movie more can enjoy it, but it wasn't a good time for me.
