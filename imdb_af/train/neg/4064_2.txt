This movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director really did "really" and it feels just like a camera flying a woman while living her life. I had to watch other movies by this director for a class, the other was not so boring. This movie was also watched for an assignment ... it's better to be boring with a good grade !! Overall, unless necessary, don't look at the movie. But do not discount other films by this director, as they are not so bad ... and do not discount other films about Africa, they are usually good, especially when done by a Western director.
