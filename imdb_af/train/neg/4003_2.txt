A great disappointment. It was one of the best British crime drama / detections from the 90s that developed the fascinating title character of Scotland's Robbie Coltrane. But this one-off has little to add and may suffer from an inevitable decline due to increased expectations when a beneficiary return after a long time. Coltrane is not really given much to do, much more attention is devoted to the uninteresting killer, and in what he must act, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The ex-soldier's story was written by the books and the attempt to work on Coltrane's family seems light. Perhaps if the authors had a whole series before them instead of just this one two-hour show, they would have written it with much more depth. As it is, skip it and look at the old 90's Cracker that is far better.
