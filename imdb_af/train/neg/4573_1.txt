I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics, so I was interested. What I didn't know is that it's not really a story, but a lot of New Age blowers who love the voice of their own voice, talk about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say this is more in the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie to give this New Age symposium. * A kind of story. Her parts of the movie are terribly touched and are meant to show the speaker's thoughts so we won't die of boredom. Matlin has a real work as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie that falls on her couch. We get to listen to unnamed people who 'mean' about the quantum physics of everything. The one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India (I assume), but I think he turned up for the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like Barbara Eden is really making herself go and she goes on and on and on and on how Quantum Science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It seems like Quark's DS9 was last on cash and he also made a short look in the movie. There is a lot of whizbang CGI that we should be impressed with; cells in the body are displayed as dance celebs, because filmmakers have often seen Flubber. <br /> <br /> People in the movie say the Arawak people in San Salvador were thinking of the Columbus ship, the Pinta was invisible. because natives have never seen chat ships, as if people had any way of knowing today. Of course, they leave all that information and just say, "Columbus's ships were invisible to the Indians in America." The film takes many such arrogant leaps. Thomas Young did a double slit experiment in 1805 and found that the light may sometimes be a particle, and a wave of time. Of course, you will never know * look at this silly movie, because the only reference is that atoms can be particles and waves. And that means people can go through walls, walk on water and never get old if they just want a star !! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just believed hard enough. I'm sarcastic, but this film is full of false hopes and beliefs that the people they see don't really like. <br /> <br /> These are New Age cooks that grabbed Quantum Theory as if it confirmed everything they believe about meditation, zero energy, crystal clearing, etc. If these snake oil sellers really believed the crap they were selling, could they not just maintain their salaries, rather than being in this joke of a movie? We listen to another nameless man, with no credentials we know, talking on his couch in front of a fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to hurry and throw a tart into his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Some other bald man in a suit says no one ever * really touches anything, because there is a magnetic force that is found on the quantum plane. If someone just walked on the screen and hit him in the stomach, shouted: "I don't touch you! I'm not touching you!" A moral relativist in the movie claims that there is "nothing like that good or bad." So it is clear that Hitler killed millions of Jews? Another person says there is "no such thing as love". It's just a chemical and we don't really love people, we're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we are around them. I suspect this man does this film as community service for so many years addicted to heroin. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a real pathetic order where two young adults walk to a wedding reception, to see everything like Robocop. They evaluate whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and a sexual position appears on the screen. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she's a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie saying people often find evidence for their beloved concepts. Maybe I only see in this review what I want to see, but I really wanted to see these people's teeth, and that never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen any of the ideas previously presented in the film, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to see a good movie talking about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, check out the man who wasn't there. If you want to read a good book on Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a movie that speaks of different philosophies with imaginative visuals, see Waking Life (though sometimes boring, self-evident, and pretentious). All in all, you should read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very difficult time giving a movie a 1 to 10 score. , but this one was very easy for me: 1/10 Stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is true. The people in this movie don't know # $ *! Hands off, the worst movie I've ever seen.
