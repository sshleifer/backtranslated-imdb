I'm 13 and I hated this movie. This is the worst movie on earth. I totally messed up my time and it was disappointed because on the front and back the picture looks good, but I did it wrong. But when I saw Delta, she was completely different and a bad actress and I really didn't know how old the two girls tried, so I was so confused. the movie was confusing in some parts and i did not enjoy it at all, but i just watched the movie just to see if it was going to get better, but it didnt, it was boring, boring and i said BORING.and I don't think many other people loved it as well as boring my bore
