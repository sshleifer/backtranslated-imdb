This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How the blob manages to eat is the biggest secret of the movie. The blob moves so slowly that another can escape into a zimmer frame. The blob has a great deal of luck coming over a typical horror moviewoman, who, instead of running away, stands still for half an hour so she can be eaten. If you didn't see this movie, I recommend you, it's too funny to take seriously.
