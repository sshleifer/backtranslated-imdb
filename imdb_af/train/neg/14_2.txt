There are times when you finish a movie, you want to get a refund for the time you spent. It was one of those times. I almost got up with just 15 minutes to endure ... and I wish I had ... <br /> <br /> The pace a man goes from a straight tense life to one of the full spinelessness and irresponsibility can never be so fast. <br /> <br /> From a graduation ceremony to the predictable termination of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and culture can be seduced by a woman, by violence and by intellectual change. Of course, the female part is understandable when the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley) are met. But a penny for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and commitment to a person he has just met is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Honestly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica, Keena, this movie has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do anything else ...
