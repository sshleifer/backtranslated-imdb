The story idea behind the lost MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story becomes a little dull to the middle, and over-utilization of stock footage as well as poor special effects sinks this film to the sub-paralel. /> <br /> The movie begins with a missile heading to Earth. In a panic, as it is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets succeed in deflecting the object. However, this is not necessarily good, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor track that destroys everything in its path. The ship is now in a low orbit across the planet. In other words, with every pass it makes, follows a sword of death - one that we can all kill! So, it is up to the good scientists of the USA (led by a very young and barely recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us - and especially save New York in its immediate flight! Unfortunately, they can't save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't tell if it's a big loss), but thanks to good old American know-how, they can eventually destroy it. harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the story idea is not bad and rather original. But so many old tracks of fighter planes and guys who get radar kicks are getting a bit old and it looked like padding. Overall, a decent but scarcely inspired film that may have extreme fans of the genre - everyone else, at their own risk.
