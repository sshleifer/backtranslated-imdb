My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same town as the screenwriter of this movie. We were very upset that the JCC brings this movie to his Jewish film festival because of the way the mentally handicapped character Frankie is portrayed. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We asked for money back. We encourage the scriptwriter to donate some of the funds to the JCC's Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We didn't like to see Frankie - a mentally handicapped and possibly even autistic teenager - as part of a joke he dropped something to look at the baby's chest. <br /> <br /> There was no point in Frankie's character, except to say, "Hey, mentally disabled is funny." Challenges like Frankie's are a serious matter. Families like mine really have suffering. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter must explain herself. Do they know families with disabled children? Do they see the families with disabled children at the JCC pool week after week?
