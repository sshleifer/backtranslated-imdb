For this movie I only saw two films by Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie movie Le Notti del Terrore (1981), known by horror fans for his memorable performance of the man-child, Peter Bark, and the enjoyable, messy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. No movie was a very spectacular movie, but both were entertained in their own special way (and the fact that they knew a lot of gore and nudity didn't hurt). However, the massacre is dull, dull, dull, despite a little splash and the strange place of gratuitous bare meat. <br /> <br /> The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the role and crew of a horror movie remain during their shooting, is confusing and so boring: when the blood doesn't flow and the skin is not on the scene, the film is a real struggle to go through (it has made four endings to me), with endless scenes of indifferent characters among themselves and doing very little of the note. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest about the film is that his producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his deaths to expel his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've seen that movie then there's very little reason to bother with Massacre.
