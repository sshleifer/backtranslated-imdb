LL Cool J did much better in this movie I was expecting! He did a fantastic job as an "apostate" police spokesman in an "apostate" department. From the beginning he does a good job of making empathy for his character and the trouble he is in. He acts as a kind of "soft giant" - a person whose rough outside can frighten anyone, but whose heart is clearly the right place from the start - and he does a wonderful job. He was clearly the best character in the movie. <br /> <br /> It was definitely a show that won't win Morgan Freeman awards. After starring in the movies like Shawshank Redemption, this film was definitely a step. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor - and in terms of the conglomeration of characters he placed himself on a back burner. There are so many ways in which his character (Moses Ashford) could play a more important role. That he was not disappointing and was a real deviation. I was hoping to see more of him in this movie. <br /> <br /> Timberlake had to stay in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and impersonal. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) corresponds to corrupt police issues that LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, she is part of shooting-em-up scenes, blood and intestines. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Looking at the beginning of the movie, there is very little tension about what will happen at the end. Think of what you would typically expect in a good-police / bad-cops conflict - and it looks like a REAL police shootout. <br /> <br /> What irritates me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shooting-out screens. He started with guns and didn't use them. When he finally came around to use one, he burned it as if he had shot his whole life a gun. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun - and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything - suddenly 2 more full-fledged guns and extra ammunition? Small plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything comes out, you'll probably like this movie. Personally, it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic. Let me believe that the story is true. This story was so clear fiction in so many aspects I get away feeling unhappy.
