I didn't watch kids movies for a few years, so I missed "Here's the Tigers" when it first came out. (I've never seen 'Bad News Bears', although I've worked in the 70s for the guys who arranged for movie, Warriors, Man Who Would King and Rocky Horror Picture Show funding .) Now I love watching old or small movies and finding good-looking people, despite being in a less important movie early. Only a few minutes in this movie I could no longer take and jump to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie that was getting bigger and better - at least watching his appearance would create interest like the plot and acting did not do the job. Now I see Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electric gambler. He has already made two or three of his early shockers, but hasn't created Freddie Krueger or made the "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped on this photo. More surprisingly, Fred J. Lincoln was in the throwing credits as "Aesop," a crazy character in the movie. F. J. Lincoln, from the 70's to a few years ago, appeared in adult movies. He was associated with the adult spoof "The Ozporns", and just that title is funnier than all the Tigers' efforts to get humor combined. Let the fact that an adult actor is placed in a children's movie is an indication of how the people who made this movie slept on the wheel.
