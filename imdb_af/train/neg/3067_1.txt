It's just bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they are apostate, are good on their own. They can take a different standpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. It was so poorly thought and executed as it could be. It wasn't a good thing even standing on its own. Viggo Mortenson is a top actor, but some of his choice of roles and projects leave something to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting, psychological adventure; it is not an adventure at all and is not pleasant or entertaining. Made from a by-the-numbers approach to making movies, stuffing into plot points someone believes in Hollywood, it will please what they see as today's filmmakers. Actually, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It is insulting that someone will portray it as a feature film, and even try to repeat a cult classic. The manipulative plot devices, the "make-it-obvious-so-they-not-miss-the-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotype characters, amateurism ... <br /> <br /> It's plain bad ....
