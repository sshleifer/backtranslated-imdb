In the beginning we get the start of a secret board of all kinds. Everything looks very promising from the beginning. With some supernatural elements being thrown in, the riddle becomes more interesting at the moment. The main character that looks like a good block comes in trouble because of his demand for money for which he is entitled (temptation) and other factors. You really experience the man and you want to know exactly what is going on. Normally, a person would have several options in his situation. Somehow he didn't have those options. In this movie it just seems to be one solution, even when it's clear, it's not his fault. From the blue he meets characters talking about church, prayer and God. And they answer the problem. This should be clear at a point in the movie that is this solution. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it's always useful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good, it simply can't escape. In real life, more needs to be done to solve problems presented in this movie. The secret that is presented to us is never solved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic that is basically nothing to do with the plot. Don't be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. The once brilliant actor is adequate, but if you look now, you'll see he's not serious at all. He must really be desperate for money. Otherwise it would have been an actor of his caliber to perform in such a movie.
