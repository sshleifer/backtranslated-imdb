To be honest, they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixteen, but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9kg emmental and the CGI was now an old hat. Perhaps if some of the actors were not well-granulated, it would have made the movie a little better. To say this is terrible to do this movie a miscarriage if you want to see something that is completely. I watched a few hours of your life and drank a sickle. It's so annoyingly awful, it's really good, but there are still some great alcoholic drinks. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie and she should be worth a look if you haven't seen it yet, don't expect anything in the line of 'Jurassic Park, the lost world' or 'apocalypto'.
