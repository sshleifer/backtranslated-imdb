Since this photo has been classified as a "pure entertainment" work and as there have been many comments on it, I would like to address something related to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the joker role in this movie. Surely as long as he was involved in the decisive work, he has always worked as a small man. An actor can change his ordinary dress, but can't change his physical appearance, and the latter can be an advantage if needed. But far from what I expected, I saw a picture very disguised, and pretend that I had exposed various aspects of baby life through a forty-year-old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what's the point? Many elements are mixed, some of the main roles are violence, sex and criminal activity, including the narrative poorly crafted and to some extent lacking in common sense: where is Vanessa when her house's peace is violated and her husband's life pursued? In addition, the diamond is even bigger than the world's No.1 Cullinan! But the most sickening facet is the constant attempt to make the little man a superman by showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; It cannot be cut by any other material, but is only overcome by the warm blood of a male goat. That's why it's no longer a diamond, but pieces of debris.
