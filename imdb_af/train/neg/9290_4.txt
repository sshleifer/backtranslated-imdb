STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transferred to a harder prison. if the Alcatraz opened again. He claims it should be closer to his wife, but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crosses roads with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mature and almost the same. But there is a gang war brewery between the black and Spanish prisoners that explode in a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader was shot dead and pointed at Burke. But the sh! T really gets the fan when the real killer and leader of hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not make successors (reportedly in contrast to the idea of ​​under siege 2 and only to do so provided the movie company he was at that time had to send his own movie) Although this is a DVD sequel, this time starring to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock images of the first movie to the end.) But there's a reason he doesn't work since Universal Soldier 2 did and that is because he is not much of an actor. Not much of an action star, managing a character that starts out as very dark and brooding, but uncomfortably turns into a standard action hero uncomfortable quipping dull one-liners. Support-wise, veterans of the first movie, Kurupt and Tony Plana, just jumped on the chance of extra work. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that tries to copy the style of the original stuff, with its dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over many. It does very well. Unfortunately, it does not come with an unrelenting hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers really like to go along with them. **
