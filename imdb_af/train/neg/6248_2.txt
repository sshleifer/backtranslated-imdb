Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science goes out of the window and "faith" and "consensus" become the subject of discussion. <br /> <br /> This is due to the fact that I give a failed point to Al Gore's documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he held the debate on "faith" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, if you try to sell the world to spend trillions of dollars to stop "Global Warming", it may be a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know how many of these current warming caused by humans. Maybe it's not, or maybe it overhauled the next ice age and we were fortunate enough to not have the planet cooked. <br /> <br /> But the fact remains that we don't know. <br /> <br /> So we are asked to "believe" in the "consensus". Remember that any scientist who disagrees with the "consensus" is eliminated. Remember that scientific inquiry differs from consensus. Einstein did not believe in the consensus, either Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So why are so much mockery of the many researchers who would promote the field by asking the difficult questions? If global warming is so indisputable, a few people testing that theory cannot be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What happens here? That's the movie I hope Al Gore would have made. Instead, he chose to strengthen his support with the true "believers" of the "consensus". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
