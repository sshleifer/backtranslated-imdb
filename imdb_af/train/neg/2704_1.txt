I do not understand why people will praise this garbage. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, terrible, and just about everything else. The film is a view of life, racial issues, prejudice and everything that is strange in college. This is where it fails. It has no understanding of reality. From many dubious non-sensible scenes in the movie, such as <br /> <br /> A black man chasing a white man with a gun, handcuffed the black man and stopped by the security guards while running the gun right next to them. <br /> <br /> The same white man who cut off roof-top people who are stopped and beaten by the same black man is then stopped and beaten by a Rodney King while the gun is running. free, while a moment later was driven back by only one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As one previous reviewer pointed out, several white men of 230 lbs were defeated by several black men weighing about Â£ 160, including the 105lbs Bust A Rhymes <br /> <br /> Yet a critical flaw in the movie is the level of unimportant main characters. Of the scared and confused white people and the average, evil, and yet rightful (?) Black people. It's almost like an insult to both black and white people. I am a white man and I know many black and Spanish people who agree that this film is wrong to portray characters and give them the attributes solely because of their races. <br /> <br /> The storyline I will now explain is about three characters. One is a black athlete, the other a confused, white girl who addresses her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared, and then blames his problems with black people and later becomes a Nazi. the movie becomes. They all share their problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fighting, love, hatred, prejudice, racial war, and oh yes, don't forget education. Whatever comes to an end for the fatal shooting. In what then they go back to their boring lives and think "white is bad". Sounds like your school years? Don't think so. I don't think the director attended the college, especially if he would make this terrible mess. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a very bad, bad, ugly movie. If you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues, check out American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of college rent Porkys. Just avoid this mess.
