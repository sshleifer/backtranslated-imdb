This one is a real bomb. We must believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestrated daughter of an ambitious politician who has to prove to the 1930s Tom DeLay that he is the presidential candidate. Poor Merle can't go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their quackery, women who are shaky and only supported by friendly uncle Harry Davenport. She blindly joined her two girls and Gary Cooper happened. Some shots of rodeo may have things, a "Misfits", but no luck with this one. Gary later breaks into a formal dinner, where Merle is presiding, and although invited to sit down and join the group, read a lecture on their snobbery. Where does this diffuse cowboy's sudden eloquence come from? The most ominous scene in the film is a ghost party that Gary holds in his unfinished home for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
