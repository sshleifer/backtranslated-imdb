Ursula Andress's naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) also have good bodies. Then why is the higher grade I can give to a movie with such a quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because we have to come to Ursula's incredible body, we have to sit by a movie that is otherwise unfriendly and boring. (Keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American one that is probably the foreign matter). In the typical Italian comedy tradition, most characters are exaggerated caricatures (the laughter freak, the "Latin lover", the drunk, the naive girl) who are not funny but just overworked. Final word: watch it, but hold your finger on the button forward, you'll need it. (*)
