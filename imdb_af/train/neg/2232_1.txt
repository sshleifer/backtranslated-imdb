I watched it ... let me reformulate ... suffered because of being a fan of Eva's. I don't think it's a movie she'll put on the head of her headlines. I like gangsta flix, but it wasn't even close. The budget could not be more than a few hundred dollars, and the money was probably spent on the caterer. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before getting the chance to care about her. <br /> <br /> I won't say badly who did what and how not because it's not worth it. I'm just glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store, I didn't actually pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you flame on me, I love movies, I thought a lotta flix was good that some of you trapped, so for me to jam it tells you everything you need to know.
