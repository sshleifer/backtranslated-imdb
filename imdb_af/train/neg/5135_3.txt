I think scarecrows are creepy, so it's a pity that this movie doesn't make them anymore. <br /> <br /> A bunch of robbers do an airplane emergency in a large field of scarecrows. One of them is going to miss the loot and the other is chasing him while he is being appointed by inexplicable malignant scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows are unimpressive (when they move). On the positive side, the director is getting tension from the static scarecrows. This is as Alfred Hitchcock says: A bomb under a table goes down, and it's a surprise. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it is going down, and it's tension. '
