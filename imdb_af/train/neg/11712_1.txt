The only reason I remember this movie is that it (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 and my friend was 18. We were the age when action flicks were our thing to enjoy the most (and 2nd most). We went out to feel insulted, we wanted our money back, but time could never be recovered. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this movie. As the truck is being attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers, the film is completely offensive to the intelligence of the audience by shooting these villainous bad guys into 4x4 VW Bugs on the truck. Please, rockets at a truck known to carry plutonium? What's worse is that these VW's can get 15-18 shots from a 4 rocket rider. You will see on VW with 4 rockets firing 2 of them, cutting the truck with the last one, coming back a second later with two rockets attached, burning another, then going in front of the truck and now it is full again 4 rockets. <br /> <br /> We pulled it out and hoped for a great finish that never happened. They seem to just run out of money and stop. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
