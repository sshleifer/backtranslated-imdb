I just want to start saying this is the first review of a movie I did on the internet. I had the need to warn people about this movie because it's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading interviews with the director, he says he respectfully responds to criticism, and so I will try to prevent the film from happening for the sake of this and give me my opinion of why I find it so catastrophic. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know that the budget might not have been allowed for big aunt but worked with Nicholson for more than ten years in the industry, he certainly knew some actors at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. The amazing lame makeup and special effects. Again, the budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended, but after so many years, there is really no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious deals with Hostel. Although it is not exactly a rip, it certainly tries to play on the former movie's success. Only problem is Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. The music. Not at all dirty or spooky, not even sick, but just irritating. <br /> <br /> 5. The writing in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also the subplots about the theater and the man coming in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. How to stumble and not in a good way. Nuf said. <br /> <br /> I'd like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (he undoubtedly has his pages on IMDb.) Visit, buddy ... what did you think? Certainly, at some point during shooting or editing, you realized what a turkey yolu had on your hands. Sorry I don't want to be hard, but you need more talent than that. I hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better, hopefully practice making progress. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, prevent it like the plague. I want to be back with interest for 81 minutes. (At least I didn't pay to see it.)
