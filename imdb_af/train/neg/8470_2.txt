I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least try them out) and it has to be the worst of the 2nd worst movie I've ever had to try and try. I never knew the depths of Masacism, until I hired this piece of malaise cheese in a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but it's worse than I would hope for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first and a half hours The credits rolled and I still had to see what pain looked like first hand. Perhaps there are a few viewers out there who enjoy it and can point me in the right direction, but then I know of the viewers who understand or don't remember me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and that is simply NOT ready. look with us (of course we had to make one exception). <br /> <br /> If it were for a remake, I give it a chance as long as they don't incorporate more than 1% of the original. That's all.
