I saw it at an arty theater that also shows "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give "Immortel" a chance. I almost ran out of this movie, and I love science fiction! The story is in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner style air adverts and similar debates on cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the screenplay isn't condensed enough for an forty-five-minute movie. There are three groups in this world: people, artificial people and Egyptian gods. The artificial people have the upper hand and control over the politics of the city. The people are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have modeled a swinging pyramid (on the Great Pyramid of Khufu with a weakened exterior that leaves a smooth "cap" on the pyramid. Will a waving futuristic pyramid not be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not kill you with the so-called plot, but there are many unnecessary gore and many spare parts. The film, as I said, was influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credits are listed for thanks to the UK, France and Italy. The film is French, but uses British actors who do not speak French. So it is clear that their French dialogue was bought. This is a distraction, and I also thought it ranged back and forth between real people and rather distracting animations. It doesn't help that the animations are poor - no better than a video game. Skip this one.
