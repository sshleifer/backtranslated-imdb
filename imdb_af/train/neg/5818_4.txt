--- What happened to these inaccessible people. Alan Arkin was, as usual, indecent and just running through the role. The kids are all a mess. Mariesa Tomei probably wants this role never got her way. And what does Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno do in this really bad, average movie? If you like to watch losers, they turn their dysfunction and try not to do better, it's your movie. Everything else, walk a book, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
