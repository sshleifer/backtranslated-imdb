A difficult movie to categorize. I never gave it a 110% concentration and therefore as simple as the plot appears. I couldn't say exactly what was doing between the American FBI characters and what their roles were. Nor can I take the Irwins seriously as movie characters, if their lines and plays were all in the style of one of his shows, not acting. <br /> <br /> It's nothing more than a glorious episode of a Discovery TV. show, with a largely insignificant subplot in progress, which just seems to be in the way. But as any Irwin show is always worth a watch, this movie is also worth it, but not on Christmas Day. Talking about what I can do better than being here. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
