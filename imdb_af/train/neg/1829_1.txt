Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can no longer stand. How this man is allowed to make movies is beyond me. I can't understand how this happens when I do the work as he does in a movie. I will be dismissed and I own the company ..... I will have to burn myself down. GOD! This movie was just a simple, steamy, smelly stack of POOs that had to be annoyed if possible. Something else I have to say about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What is wrong just to say a few things about a movie? I will never understand why websites will have to write a short novel, because sometimes a brief comment is needed.
