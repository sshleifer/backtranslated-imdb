(There are Spoilers). Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer, takes over the life and car of 18 virgin, although he is too shy to admit it, batsmen, Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the movie Myia not only exposes but gives poor, innocent and naive Trent a lesson on how to see a dangerous mulberry and keep it far away for him or her, to prevent it from being in one turn. <br /> <br /> To keep a trucker halt, Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action, in the back seat of his buggy. Roy is too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is no different from his estranged daughter! Indignant that Miya is reluctant to locate it with him. Roy hardly puts her off to be interrupted by the first-year collage student Trent Colbert who moves into the rest of the team. <br /> <br /> See her chance Miya jumps into Trent's car and the two are down in what seems to be the strangest car hunt ever put into a movie. Going across the north-eastern US, the two ended up engaging in a truck engine, killing a murder and a shooting with state officials who then led Trent's parents home while being held hostage. It is there that there is another wild shooting between the mad Miya with a whole SWAT team being strengthened by the local police and state-owned agents. <br /> <br /> You'll expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be intentional or unintentional, but it's not. In fact, the film is very disturbing in how Miya deals with everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her distorted and child-molesting father Roy. With the drive to drive her all over the northeast, Miya gets the poor slob drunk and joins him in a motel room with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle. Miya also gets it with the owner of the motel, the horny Mr. Foster, by tricking him into giving her his gun, as part of a strange sex game. After taking Foster, she takes off with Trent's, which is cold in his motel room, a wallet with about $ 400 in it, but doesn't bother driving off his car. <br /> <br /> Paying money to pay for gas to come home with his parents for Thanksgiving, Trent gets a call on his Miya mobile phone to pick her up at a local dinner for his money get back. As the push that he is Trent, Miya, now a refugee from his law, later becomes her father, Roy, on the open road as he tries to run both Trent & Miya off the road. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this deserted house chasing Roy, Miya, to run him on a muddy road in high heels, with him to get it into what you know, with a explosion of his own shotgun. Roy was so busy picking up his pants that he forgot that he had left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> With both tribute and murder as well as a hit and run, they beat the two desperados at a S&M / Tattoo boutique where Trent pierces his ear and nose and is dressed in leather and chains, by Myri, along with a matching silk and her dog collar. It's to meet his straight and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. <br /> <br /> With a running shootout with the state officials, with one of those badly injured, the two refugees from the law end with Trent's parents, Mr. and mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn at home. The entire local police force, with a SWAT team, is waiting for them. <br /> <br /> Obnoxious movie with a really disturbing final ending that makes you wonder what exactly the movie has been, if ever it's heard. You initially felt a lot of sympathy for Miya, but if the movie got stuck together, it ended indifferently which evaporates as fast as a donut of ice cubes in Death Valley. Although Roy was the most unlikely person in the film for the first time, Miya completely obscured him.
