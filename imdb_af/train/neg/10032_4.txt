The storyline was okay. Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looks bad. There was so much color and crying about her size zero, but she didn't look nice. I don't know why hell Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role. There was nothing to do with him in the movie. Just because it's a Yashraj movie doesn't mean an actor has to play the role, but how bad it is. Said Ali Khan was good. I think it is high time that Indian directors and producers started thinking of Indian customers as intelligent fate. What are we? fools !!!! What they think, they'll show 2 men are taking a SWAT team out and we'll believe them. Is Indian police so stupid that they are trying to miss some criminals ... They take a whole group of 100+ policemen and no one was there to surround the palace. The action was crazy and I have never seen such a bad action. Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen who all shot at him ..... and he shot back. None of the policemen touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Kak. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the battle director who thought of this scene should take retirement. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not watching this movie.
