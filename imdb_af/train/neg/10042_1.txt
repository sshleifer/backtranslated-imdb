Such a long-awaited movie. But it disappointed me and my friends on the first day of the movie. Some of the trailers looked like an action movie, but it seems to be an out-of-the-box comedy (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the actions of these professional actors, they have done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but I don't think it can save the movie. India is beautifully shot. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) Were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless, the way in which the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot, made me find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> Action ranges were shot very sharply, no one could make not From the head and tail of the stunts, they used Akki (akshay kumar) very well, but could do much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I have seen in recent movies (90's movies have better animated scenes I suspect (initial scene where the car falls, "flying, must be better word"). /> <br /> And the movie's name is called almost every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name, I think.
