So you can read some of the comments on this movie, and you may think of yourself, "Huh. There was probably a lot of RAVE REVIEWS on December 30." Funny thing, most of these rave reviews sound like they come from the same person, or at best a small, co-ordinated "Open House" group. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is really uncompromising. Just because it's 'independent' doesn't mean it gets a free pass. If you want to make a musical, whether on film or on stage, whether on Broadway or at the local community's playhouse, make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance, (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score, and (e) you have lyrics that are meaningful and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can't save this one. This is one of those unfortunate movie events where I was really ashamed of everyone involved.
