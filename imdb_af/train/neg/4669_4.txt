Interestingly, a novel without plot has become the basis for two films. While The Heiress was a good, if not quite accurate, fit, Washington Square was a hands-on and poor act, except for the part of Dr Sloper, a movie that could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> The directors' efforts to make 'beautiful' scenes were so obvious that I actually cut. It has none of the underestimated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have, like Onegin. I agree with other comments about Leigh's depiction of Catherine as an idiot, rather than naive and shy; She made me despise that she didn't feel her. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childlike trust to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was internalized, just as it was in the novel. But we don't have the benefit of a narrative voice telling us in a movie! I think someone skipped the adaptation class at film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the directors' efforts to make a moving and beautiful movie out of a difficult text, but it just didn't work.
