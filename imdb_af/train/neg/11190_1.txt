First of all I must say that I worked for a buster and saw quite a few movies to the point. It's hard for me to find something I haven't seen. Taking this into account, I want everyone to know that this movie is by far the worst movie ever made, made it to me for Gigli, my boss's daughter, and any other litter you've ever seen. Be silent, I just found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about. If you can decipher this movie and tell me what it is about, the author or a fortune teller should be, because there is some other way a person can think of this mistake. <br /> <br /> FOR THE LOVE OF GD Stay away!
