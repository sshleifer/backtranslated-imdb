I gave this movie a 2, and although I consider myself a science fiction fan, I found this movie very difficult to take seriously. It was a late night at AMC, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for some laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects are average for the period - not terrible, but not good either. Of course, we know more about Mars now than we did at the time, but we really can't hold this film. The main reason I didn't like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this movie I wanted to explore, in a little more detail - the astronaut's injury / condition, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, and so on. Overall, the movie is much like a long episode of the 1960s version of the Outer Limits - completed with a cheesy end.
