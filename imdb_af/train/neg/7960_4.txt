I hired it because the second segment traumatized me as a small child. I went about a morning about, I watched HBO and The Raft (segment 2) did me good. This time I still enjoyed The Raft, although I couldn't tell if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good one. The other two segments were complete trash. I can't believe a producer is paid somewhere to make this litter. All I had achieved by looking at it was to ruin another memory of childhood. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad in my list of infected childhood classic. 10/04
