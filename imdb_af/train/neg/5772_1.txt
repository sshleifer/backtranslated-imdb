I just need to add, if someone actually reads it and hasn't got it completely. These other reviewers are not joking, it's really the worst color movie you'll probably ever see. When the movie started, I couldn't believe such a thing, it actually went for the world. <br /> <br /> They don't just say when they say it looks like a home movie. It really works. Like the "director", the family grabbed hi8 video camera (for DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc.) but grabbed some decent acting students and went out shoot a movie. No script, just to make it up while he went along. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, it was on my mono TV, so I only had one channel sound (left of right speaker). At first I thought I had it wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke within minutes. I got up and switched to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects, but couldn't hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be funny to watch, so bad that it's good, kind of thing. I'm not sure it's one of those. I mean, I will admit it is a bit of a budding movie maker. And if you see bad movies, you're just out there and prove you can do better, you know. But when I looked at it, I was just sorry for everyone who made it. <br /> <br /> Just as bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the shortness of her bathing scene. A bit of T and A of her would have increased the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But unfortunately, no. If you want to make a movie, but it is unashamed, throw some free nudity. Work for Roger Corman.
