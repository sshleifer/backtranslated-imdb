Okay, so the launch, with its hokey offer of a free coffin for anyone who dies of the horror of terror, is so nice it's funny. And so the first "skull scene" is so signed up and unpredictable it is funny. The real plot of the movie is somewhat decent, there is at least a bit of real food for thought in the behavior of the characters, and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go. The acting is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> Altogether, this movie doesn't fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie will be. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest score or even the lowest. If I had just read the script, I would say it was potentially a decent movie. It's just the hearing direction and production that destroys the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there are far worse kids out there.
