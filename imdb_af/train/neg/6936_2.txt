Well, I don't know what people in this movie have seen, I don't know. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday and I had a serious headache. Besides some good dialogue there is nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The big bart is now preaching to fall in love with girls of your half age. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the movie at all. I wanted to give 1 score but give 3 if <br /> <br />. I like the role of the little girl called "AB". my word "DONT WATCH" <br /> <br /> save your self donot look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Save time and money.
