Dolph Lundgren stars as a temple man who comes to New York when a key unlocking the anti-Christ is found by an archaeologist. Of course, the devil is just a few miles behind Dolph and is not as easily murdered as being transferred from body to body. body. (Like Fallen without the tension). Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely incompatible. I admit that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren, such as Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme. I try to watch his movies when they are on TV. I caught The Minion and boy was I ever disappointed. This movie is absolutely horrible. With action sequences so poorly educated and badly edited, you can hardly make coherent meaning in the battlefield. Worst of all, Lundgren's ugly unconvincing perf as a tough old priest (!), Though it got worse that the movie was such a horror of Fallen (which was good) and the end of the days (which was bad, but better than this) overall This movie is the worst movie I saw of Dolph Lundgren. It literally has nothing to recommend it. It's awful and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters of the Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out of 4- (Awful)
