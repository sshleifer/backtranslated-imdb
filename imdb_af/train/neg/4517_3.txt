There is plenty to appreciate here: spectacular places and flying rows; period costumes, props and sets; and competent writing and acting. However, to enjoy a drama, we need at least one principal who exhibits certain qualities that we can hold or admire. In these many cats snobs, have we only found one character that is all about everyone? an intrepid man in a volatile peripheral role as their helpless victim. From the reviews here, it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we did not find their malicious schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining. Even the dog is contemptuous. We threw the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should briefly discount these observations, but what I could find about this mini-series we have no reason to expect character transformation or salvation.
