Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei. Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <br /> Overview: <br /> <br /> To review this movie and get good background, I need to start. And the start of this is really George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect prosecution and call it Zombie 2. The movie is the one we know as plain ole zombie. You know the one in which the zombie is fighting with the shark! OK, after that movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a big piece of cash, the Italians decided. Let's make some more zombie flicks! These things are running in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Still confused? The story about this one is actually just a rehash of stories we've seen in many American zombie flicks we've seen before. The best comparison to keep in mind is the return of the living dead. Let's see ... there's the government that makes experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Buyers are released into the general population and shebang! We get a lot of zombies that long for human flesh. A lot of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They have to fight the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of trouble shooting this movie. First, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of Italy, was ill. So he couldn't really finish this movie as he wanted. The film was then handed over to two less directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of Living Death) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to make a movie that wasn't so good. You see Fulci did not really have his heart and soul on this movie. He was disillusioned with it. He handed the movie to the producers and basically said, "Do what the hell you want!" And God loves them. They did it. <br /> <br /> And that's why ladies and gentlemen have such a crazy zombie movie with the big Fulci being credited as the "director" of it. The biggest problem in my opinion is that it's just a useless bore! There is nothing about it! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the poisonous gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the movie is just a bunch of empty, rare characters without any personality running down the zombies. Now it can be fun in some cases, if # 1 makes the zombie and zombie action is really good and fun and # 2 there are many gore and gut involved. <br /> <br /> We don't get here either! Well, there are some inspired moments there, such as when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. It was cool. There is also a scene where a flying zombie head is involved (which simultaneously disrupts all logic and explanation) and a scene of zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and cutting off a poor girl legs. But from there the rest of the movie just goes flat on his ass. <br /> <br /> Endless scenes that don't do jackets endlessly, to move the already non-existing plot together. This was my main gripe with this movie. The sets look unfinished and the art is virtually non-existent. I hate it if everything looks so unfinished! I love my b-movies, but this one just really went down there! It is closer to a z-level flick if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The zombie makes up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a lot of Asian looking for zombies. But it's not a big problem, as they are in the Philippine islands anyway. It's the appearance of the zombies who really suck! They all died with the same clothes for some reason. And what goes for the zombie here is a bunch of black makeup (more like skins) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make-up, but it wasn't good enough to impress. It's just a bunch of goo that spat on the actors' faces. Not only is this movie slow, but the zombies look like shit. It's supposed to be dead people! Anyhows, for those who expect the usual coolness in a Fulci movie, don't expect it here because it's mostly someone else's movie. And the two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) do not really have heart and soul in it. In fact, if you see the extras on the DVD, you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his memories and his feelings on it, he doesn't even flicker it. You could say he was ashamed of it and on many occasions he said they only had a job to do and they did it. And this my friends, is the last nail on this movie. There is no love, and no heart in making this movie. That's why you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick. <br /> <br /> Only for the complete or the people who want or watch every zombie movie ever. Everyone else, don't even bother! Rating: 1 out of 5
