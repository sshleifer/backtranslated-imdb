Am I wrong, or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? I have to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad editing, etc. The only "exploitation" aspect here is how we are ripped off for money buying this piece of crap. It's nothing more than a light porn movie ... no real gore, not scary images, just a cheap piece of garbage. If anyone wants to see an excellent movie without name actors, a little clever gore and a decent storyline ... get Baby Blood ... also on a cheap budget but well made ... and a real story too! a waste of money, but I'll just keep it for a laugh. It's pathetic! New comment .... Sept 3 ..... I'll keep this movie forever, just because it's SOOOOO, it's almost fine .... in a very bad way .... the worst acting ever. .. a real crap movie classic!
