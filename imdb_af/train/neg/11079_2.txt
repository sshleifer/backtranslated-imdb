Over a couple of years of searching for half-decent movies for my kids to rent, I developed a sixth sentence for the really case-like, live video efforts that are really painful to go through (for anyone over eight ). I dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the film and asked me, "What did she say?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes hurt to roll them every minute or so because characters have done a very bad job of introducing random plot changes. And the next time someone decides that it has absolutely no skill with a sword, simply "realism" to a movie, please use it with a dim butter knife. "Prehysteria!" was head and shoulders above this. Arrgh.
