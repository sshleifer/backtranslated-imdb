One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, poor TV-style cinematography, bad acting. Sad to see so many well-known old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. Lead Lady Nancy Young can't act. Terrible direction. Supported with bad TV movies. Sometimes poor jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the movie doesn't make sense. Somehow it is supposed to stop a wedding, but there is no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing stopped my wife, but I suffered through it. The old men have to act like they are young and horny, but it comes out so pathetic rather than funny. How did they even get the money to make it?
