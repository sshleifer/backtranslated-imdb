The only thing that often appears in my head while writing this review is that I will never get back that hour and a half !!! to show that I'm not just air blowing, I will compare the movie with the other movies of the cubilogy (cube and hyper tube)! Cube wasn't big, but it was original and made for some technical flaws! if a successor lost the advantage of originality, but it looks pretty nice and I even gave it better than cube (the story was better)! but zero cube compared to its predecessors is really not worth it! a complete lack of good fx, a very f * ck * d up script and just old bad act, does not combine well! example: all the time in the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... should happen and then it will happen, so it's not very original either! my advice: don't lose that hour and a half I've lost !!!!!!!! oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
