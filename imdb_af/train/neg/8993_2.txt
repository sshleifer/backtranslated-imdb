Back in the 70's, when I first saw it, I was at high school. It was cool then. Now as an adult I look back and I tell myself. Right now. What was so funny? It has moments, but they are few and far between. It is so dated that the jokes no longer rise. Show it to a younger crowd and they will be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor, you might like Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision as well as Groove tube are too dated for today's viewing.
