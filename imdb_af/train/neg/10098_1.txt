Not worth renting the video or worth the time or occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * Acting was over ... poor direction. * Editing was a lot of choppy ... many things didn't make sense or just seemed to be free. * Sound was poorly bought. * Music was highly inappropriate. * Casting was a lot off ... had to be cracked. * Zombies talking, let alone ... ride, dance, work ... just piss me. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! As dreaded as he was ... he was the most beautiful zombie of all. It doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The cover art was good, but very deceptive ... as was the main menu of the DVD ... good artwork and music. <br /> <br /> DON "T BOTHER!
