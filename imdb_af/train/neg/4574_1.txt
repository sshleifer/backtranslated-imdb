I went into this movie, expecting it to be similar to The Matrix of Pi. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written, poorly activated plot in the movie (with CG animated cells and peptides to start). The real focus of the movie, however, is the "expert" talking heads spitting brand new emotional quarters between the plots. <br /> <br /> Sure, it doesn't die enough. There is a bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. This explains, for example, that electrons exist as both particles and waves, and that an atom is mostly empty space. The film, however, takes a giant (and unscientific) leap, saying that sub-atom quantum effects also occur on large scale. The talking heads take it even further. According to them, the following are true: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean Sea, the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were unable to see anything so different no. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. With positive thoughts you can walk on water. -The thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in bottles of water. <br /> <br /> It's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This movie felt like a movie they would show you to join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized it was basically the same. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be seen as a campsite comedy (even though it's not a funny comedy). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: Don't see this movie.
