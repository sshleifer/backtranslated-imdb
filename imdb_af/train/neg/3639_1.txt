This movie sucks from beginning to (especially) the end. You probably don't get worse, acting, storyline, photography, camera work, etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But this makes it a 'good' watch, giving you more than enough good laugh. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what these people think about making this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is ridiculously ridiculous, it's more like a comedy in disguise, like Mafia, also senseless, but damn funny. And watch out for the very end of the movie ... uhum.
