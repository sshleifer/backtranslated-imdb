"Her cardboard lover" is Norma Shearer's last movie. She stopped the movies and thought I joined the board at MGM. It was a good move for her. "Her cardboard lover" was talkative and boring in parts. It was clear that there were only a handful of actors with talking parts, so they had a lot of dialogue to talk about stopping this turkey. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea of ​​a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) hired by a man (Robert Taylor) to envy her playboy fiancee (George Sanders). I am surprised that director, George Cukor, does not have much of the talky scenes between Mrs. Shearer and Mr. Taylor did not cut. Mr. Cukor served Mrs. Shearer well in "The Women", but not in this movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career he gave in 1941 his best comedy roles in this movie and "When Ladies Meet". In 1942 he gave his best comedy show in "Her Cardboard Lover" and so far his best dramatic performance in "Johnny Eager." He had a busy year. I think of all the actors at MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all the big and underage actresses. MGM also Taylor gave all kinds of movies to make - most of them were successful. That's why MGM has kept it 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a social heel. He played a similar role eight years later in "Everything about Eva" for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. What Mrs. Shearer, it was one of her worst performances, she wasn't funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It's strange that she made a big comedy, "The Women" in 1939, and delivered her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old for her younger leading men in "Her cardboard lover." It also didn't help that some of her clothes were terrible. <br /> <br /> She and Mr Taylor didn't make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the wonderful "Escape". The same comment about this movie can be said of another movie, "Personal Property" which Mr. Taylor made with Jean Harlow in 1937. It was too talkative, boring, and the actress grew old. Me. Harlow fell ill in the movie and no one in Hollywood noticed telling her to see a doctor. In 1937, she died at the age of 26. What a waste! She is becoming a good actress and getting better roles.
