For those of us who lived through the weeks of filming in the village and around the Valley - so we don't forget about the boring days of road closure and movie filming. In memory of those who live here, locals include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was the BC fireplaces; Chase plays including Moon Drive from Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most approachable, Matt Broderick was above us all - even then. As far as the movie goes - a joke of a screenplay and even a bigger laugh about acting and play - but caring at this level. A fun time capsule for those who enjoy our coast and valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), original name of the movie, was welcome at Buzzsaw. The old Erba's parking lot was the town square. The backyard shots were off Grove Street in Boulder Creek. Turn off the mindset and see some actors in their early days.
