I just don't get out of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable and there is something so ugly that will make you. Someone here has commented that it may be the frequency of light waves or something rather than ugly. Miranda is just a while. The episode is slow, inconsistent and too talky. I also don't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why does the Federation not just leave the Medusans dams? There is one part I like when Kolos speaks about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even with his lamest, I will always vote. This episode though - mmm, I won't buy it, except for a used copy below $ 3.
