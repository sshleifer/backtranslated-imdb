*** Comment contains spoilers *** I barely kept on this show as appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps was on average a shooting case, when the whole nasal Diane Farr was of course pregnant . (but we were not noticed) and when Colby was ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, tonight's episode, David is caught up with a paranoid, neutral work that an OVERS amateur with a gun, in a lift and .... He can't deny him. An educated, experienced field agent who has spent the first time through the door and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat, cannot take any nuts. Not when the neutral work shines, look away, fall its head, close its eyes; not even when looking at the fiber optic cable that spins around the ceiling around the ceiling about 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the scene came to let me know that I learned so much from the Chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent, otherwise engaged. Don gives David the "emergency word" which is the code for "The s ** t going down"; David is right, they kill the lights, let go of the elevator, start the marsh and ...... <br /> <br /> David can't work in the entry of the nuts. The bad guy ends with both things, David ends SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS is fun.
