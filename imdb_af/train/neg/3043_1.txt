This movie is supposed to be a "sad" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. But instead it comes down to being really creepy. Two things in this movie that stick out in my mind are frightening. 1) The way Santa looks. - Have you ever seen a more horrible Santa Claus? and 2) the "evil rep of Satan" Pitch's habit of odd dances is just sick to look. Just look at this movie if it's the MST version or if you want a very good laugh. I can't believe it's a children's movie.
