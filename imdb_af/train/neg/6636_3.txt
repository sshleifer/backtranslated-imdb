Of the worst, most natural appearances I've ever seen. This may not be surprising, as the clumsy dialogue is given to one note characters. Add to that the cheap production value and you have a movie that doesn't even seem to belong on television. One doesn't expect much of a lifelong movie, especially one of those old ones, but it's almost uncompromisingly bad. <br /> <br /> Plot-wise, it's a horrible, cleaved romance of some kind, even Harlequin, would consider among them. It is possible to guess how the rest of the movie goes by simply watching the opening couple scenes. Surprise, the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious alien falls in love.
