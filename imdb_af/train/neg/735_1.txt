Five-year-old Michael sees his mother shot dead by his ceremony dad, The Highwayman, who commits suicide. "Twenty Years Later" Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) has grown to invite seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents' home to master their own fears during a Halloween night suit party. Morty, a live-sized wooden doll, held by the Indian woman's attire, is owned by the dead father's spirit and kills them with their phobias. Characters are thrown out of a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, inflated, etc. Morty morphs in the father and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wipes. After hitting a girl and stuffing it in a cardboard box, the characters stay in the house, cheer, jokes and sex. <br /> <br /> The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees of the original Friday, the 13th) is surprisingly delicious like the grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of fake horror stories, bad acting, brain-dead characters, repetitive flashback footage and annoying distorted camera work. Plus, the only two minority characters (the Indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. BLAH!
