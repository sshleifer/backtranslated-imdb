The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. A rich family in Rome lives every day, it's boring and fake, with everyone asking others what they think of them. Really boring after half an hour, because it's easy to understand where the story will end. This is because it is easy to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie, so even the most difficult parts look normal. To sum up in the first 2 minutes of the movie, it would be enough and the purpose of the movie has already been said. The family has seen 30 years, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show reality, but to be coherent with its thoughts should push more than normal situations. Really good, how did Muccino put the camera in the right place, move with the cars and that's the only reason I didn't sleep in the cinema, but always in the movie from the beginning. Perhaps it might be good to see the family what it really is and not to blame it. Morante was intense and big as usual but unfortunately on a bad movie!
