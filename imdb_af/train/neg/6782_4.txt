Not one of Keaton's best efforts, it was perhaps a hidden attempt to avenge him on the family he was married to - the Talmadges. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences lead Buster into a marriage with a large Irish woman, who (with her father and brothers) treats him carefully until they think he can be a fortune heir. Wrong identities are abundant here - gags have been drafted and but for the main failure to pay off. <br /> <br /> This Metro short has at least two real laughs - Buster is smart to turn his lack of dinner using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family literally on the meat bring his plate. The other is a family photo, with the whole group falling slowly when the camera's tripod loses its stability. <br /> <br /> The yeast overflow could be the catalyst for a massive range of gags. on gags, but stop short (for all the build up) of development. <br /> <br /> Movie's pressure is sharp and clear and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.
