I watched this movie last week and have the biggest laugh I've had. The plot of the movie is pretty stupid and winding in a poorly worked way. The only plus in the film is Corey Savier's impressive abs. Alexandra Paul (I think it's her name) is terrible as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is gross and his character is a twit above everything. And as if you think she has sex with her son, it's not enough, they throw unnecessary sax solos on every occasion! The end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughing. I mean who the hell the kid wants from a guy who tried to make you think he was your son and that you had a bloody relationship with him!
