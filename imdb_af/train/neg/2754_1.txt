My original review of this movie was simply the word sh * t written 2000 times past. Although it was a very accurate criticism, I felt my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the main actress; her facial expression doesn't even change in this movie, she doesn't show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills almost came to her left and right eyes and looked like she didn't know a jack. She's an emotional shell I guess had too much botox. However, her lack of facial expression by the film comes through the unfortunate love affair with the main actor who seems to be coming out of nowhere and falling on a beach and meeting within hours. The lead actor, whose hair needs more attention than he did, was mediocre at best and didn't even make me feel he was really in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing the scary play is, is the directing, storyline and inaccuracies in plot. I saw tampon ads with more structure than this movie. It is not a development in character, they just want to say and do things I could never believe a real person would want. <br /> <br /> This movie would not have been bad if it was trying to be the right way to snakes on a plane, but it was so hard to be a serious act I couldn't even laugh at no. I believe I now have a brain tumor of this movie and look at all the different ways I could use that budget and a team to create something much better. If I bought it on DVD, I would break the DVD into pieces, burn it, then it would dissolve in hydrochloric acid in a good way. DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE!
