the man who wrote, directed and stared at this shocking piece of garbage should really consider a caregiver's consideration. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this crap? There are so many talented writers out there who can spend money better. I think the idea is good, but the acting, writing and directing are just awful! The jokes aren't so funny, I understand they're supposed to take the microphone. BUT do it with style, this movie screams live sketches in 1995 on Saturday night. Why, I say again why do studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NO COMEDIAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECT AND STAR IN HIS OWN MOVIE. Duh!
