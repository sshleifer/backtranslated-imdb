First of all, let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie. The best review for this kind of Cinema can only be the silence. Movie directed to housewives and grandmothers. This movie is "really" trying and the characters are supposed to be "real people". An Italian can never think the characters may be "actually": they are just "low-profile" stereotypes. This gives a very wrong vision of what life in the Italian countryside is. The plot is weak (plot? What plot?) And the humor doesn't make anyone laugh over the age of 12.
