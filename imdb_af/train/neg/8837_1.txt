This movie is terrible. I really looked forward to it, since I thought "Lantana" was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoilers <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, the good things: it looks good, some of the appearances is OK. The bad things are all different. <br /> <br /> The story, as you may know, is about a few blocks that will go fishing and discover a body, with the strife they find on Friday, but will continue to fish and eventually report it on Sunday when return. in mobile (mobile) series. But the movie takes time (the boy takes time) to go to this central event. <br /> <br /> Of the ensemble of characters (about a dozen), none of the other looks (that is, I suppose consistently because they are all unlikely). I was extremely frustrated because I did not adequately explain how the characters relate, and it wasn't until near the end of the movie that I could vaguely build the family tree. <br /> <br /> It is hard to think of a movie that is indifferent to us, which is a failure in the structure of the story, as the characters' lives look just as bad before the fishing trip as after. . Once you have put the beam so high, it is difficult to stand up. It is short of anyone who commits suicide. <br /> <br /> Logic is stupid. The murderer immerses the body in the lake, and somehow it floats upstream in the mountains. The fishermen leave on Sunday morning, but Byrne comes home for some reason after his wife goes to bed. Then, the first morning, the next morning, the police slammed the door to get him to come to the station. Um, they didn't hear from the phone? At the station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the body. <br /> <br /> Absolutely missing from the story is the debate that the blocks certainly had after they found the body. It's a mystery - everyone asks them "how can you do that?" and the audience asked the same question. (The debate on what to do with the body is the key role in "Liberation"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to walk to the car, drive to the mobile, call the police, wait and they lead them back to the place. If the others are waiting at the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> Much of everything just looks fake. The only thing observed was that local aboriginals like the girl were black, seized the fishermen's actions as racist - would not have done if it was a white girl. <br /> <br /> Throughout there is a strange indifference to which the girl might have murdered (I think the subject is mentioned once), and there is no secret as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene . /> <br /> So I sit bored and confused immediately when there is a twist - not in the plot, but the theme. Suddenly, it is about the silent dignity of the deprived indigenous people, leading to a ridiculous ending with some incoherent things about black-and-white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian film "at its best", according to The Age.
