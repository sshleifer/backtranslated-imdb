Sorry, this movie didn't scare me, it just irritated me. It was just as frustrating when I saw the potential and it all fell to the edge. The kids! The father! The clue! Had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I've heard it before. Frightening! No! I can only scare myself, here where I sit, as they could in the movie. Are there people writing that figure that women should be so annoying? Huh? This movie was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been if the director / writer bothered to work it. We could have had some good music that would add to the stress, if anyone did the trouble. What I really want to know is why do they get the money? Just give it to me and save all that trouble. Leaving? ... No betray us where
