This movie is not funny. It's not entertaining. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead to the least interest in the characters or situation. In addition, it's about a movie as something in recent memory. It is as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school children who have never actually met or had some kind of relationship with a real girl, sat down and wrote a movie based on their wrong fantasies about what an adult man would be. This movie is boring, disagreeable, and sometimes offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also, it looks twice as long as its 85 minutes running.
