The title song for this movie ........... is the greatest generous ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I first looked back in 1978-79 when I first subscribed to the cable. In 1979, cable just started to become commonplace in homes. (or at least when it has become common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> It may well be the first movie I've ever seen on the payline called "The Movie Channel" - which the Star Channel "changed their name to" The Movie Channel "in the early 1980's ........ I got a free month of "The Star Channel" with my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of those movies that was in heavy rotation at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember remembering to watch this movie back and think it was a typical teen movie (in the same line as other medium-budget teen flashes) ... the one where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I totally forgot that this movie even existed until I recently saw this movie again after I didn't see it for decades (I offered a copy of it on DVD for sale in a cheap bin) "I recognized it and bought it for just $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> Looks like I remembered that this movie was much better. However, it was a different experience than watching now (30+ years later). <br /> <br /> It was nice to see the children's list to make rock n roll music, smoke smoke and have sex in the back a fine (often all at the same time). That's what a good teenage party movie should be. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasized about sex with his arch-enemies, good friend does not blow all his savings money for a provoked Dodge Van (with a mantle wall with flush wall, a mirror ceiling and a waterbed in it) to get her attention and eventually get sex with her. But his bow rider finds out and looks for him (so that the two of them can solve their differences by dragging their cars). He and his bow rival finish both of their trucks, and instead of stealing away his arch-enemy friend, he wins the heart of a preppy (less attractive) girl he half-asss most of the movie and he decided he was happier / better off and the movie ended. <br /> <br /> The movie does have funny moments. But look at this movie 30+ years later, it becomes more of a trip to the memory lane. As I still remember Pizza kiosk, pinball arcades, it also brought memories of the crossing of a small town as we smoked a pot as we were shouting with pretty girls and hoping to be laid. (Sometimes I will be happy and get some luck looking at girl to share a joint with me and we want to screw the back back afterwards, I also remember many of the songs in this move (when they were new) ... ... this movie serves as a perfect time scale for that era in those greetings (brought back many memories) <br /> <br /> The one thing portrayed in this movie, which I honestly can't remember, is. ... I never remembered when the full size of it was as popular as this movie portrayed them, I remember it very well, and I'm not going around young men who want them to have a bus. I remember young men in the 70s (including themselves) who were a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang, but never ordered, this movie seems to be the most popular item and that every young man wanted one (which just wasn't from that era)
