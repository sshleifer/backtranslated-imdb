We laughed our heads. This script is so incredible that you won't sleep or sleep for CNN. <br /> <br /> For 30 years my dad was a sea captain. He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer, he once ordered the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and (sorry) on his desk. Of course it was not on a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, core or not. Giving a drill at that time is just Hollywood writing. When a captain is arrested, he is arrested, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are held. It is stored within a well-guarded room within minutes. He can't escape, it's just like in jail. <br /> <br /> Funny thing is, my dad also has a dog on board, but we see Hackman let him go in the control room. This has never been done. My dad cleaned up all the mess the dog made wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars to which this movie is credited, the rest are bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> If we know that 23 people are still living on the Kursk, this film gets an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
