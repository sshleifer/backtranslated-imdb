I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities look terrible. Also the mob characters seem too strange. Warren Beatty didn't do a terrible job as Dick Tracy, but certainly not one of his better performances. Madonna should just keep singing. Glenne Headly did good work in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 due to the wonderful play of Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career, but he still did a good job.
