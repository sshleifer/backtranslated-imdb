Lorenzo Lama's stars as a kind of CIA agent, taking on an exotic beauty called Alexa, kidnapping her daughter and forcing her to fight her previous employers. O.J. Simpson is also on board to offer a drop of perceived credibility to the non-talented ensemble. I have to admit I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his movies. He stinks. But compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas's comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas looks like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I just saw the CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J. Simpson trial. You see, if your parents had cable and the extra channels, you couldn't escape this movie. In 1994 you could go to an Amish community and a few morons would have it in their portable TV. The movie itself is a collection of lame action series and would be intrigues, although O.J. Simpson's shock value jumps to fireballs and exchanges is one linen offering unintentional humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make it a complete camp classic? <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
