The writing is nice. Although the casting is absolutely invisible. No style. The costumes don't look like some of the High Highbury societies. Comparison of Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that. Beckinsale English speaks better than Mrs. Paltrow, although in Mrs. Paltrow's play is the nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he's romantic and not at all spectacular and careless as Mr. Knightley in the TV version. P.S. The spectator cannot at all mr. See Elton-Ms. Smith's development as it was in the motion version, so one cannot understand where Emma is trying to make an Elton-Smith game (except the portrait).
