A squashy slapstick mess that appears as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian Bulry champion who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his people's desert spread in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd (which needs a stud). Which director, Peter Tewksbury, desperately needs some storytelling skills, but what he lacks in the assessment makes him sloppy comic mounts (his social commentary is not exact, but Tewksbury has a satirical stance on his indifference and there are some funny scenes). Despite colorful supportive turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general wackiness is getting out of hand, and there is too much hope and hollerin to maintain much interest. As far as Elvis is concerned, he is completely loose and decorated. And while it's nice to see him on the screen, you have to wonder if he just gave up on movies. These photo shambles have a clear what-the-hell feel, and although spirits are high, the yields are usually low. * 1/2 of ****
