This movie is an idiotic attempt on some action thriller. A coach on the way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white rubbish hijackers who drive dune bumps. They drive them into the desert and steal all their precious items. The plot is constantly changing. One minute they are looking for a rich farmer's daughter, the following are looking for a $ 90,000 collectable stamp. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please don't see this movie.
