I was looking forward to this trip and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I'm very easy on rollercoaster and amusement park rides. <br /> <br /> The roller coaster part was just okay - and it was all about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> It was desperate to be like a mix of far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland, and failed in every aspect. <br /> <br /> It wasn't exciting or exciting. In the least.
