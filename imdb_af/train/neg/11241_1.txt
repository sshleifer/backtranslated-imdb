If you are looking for hippo, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live performers. The visuals are fun and interesting to watch throughout the movie. Now it says, the footage is the only thing good in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes I knew I was watching one of the worse movies of all time. I was hoping this movie would get better, but it never gained any interest. After thirty minutes, the urge to get out has continued to grow and grow. Now, I own more than 2,000 movies and have probably seen the number five times. Yet it is just the second movie I have felt about my whole life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- there is no one. The three main artists are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other movie I wanted to go out) is just awful in the title role. I'd rather sit down at Ben Affleck in Gigli than look at Reg again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow is trying so hard to be camping, that it falls back in her face. The last article I read read that Paltrow is thinking of staying at home and rather being a mother than acting. After this show I will welcome the decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soaps are better written. The story behind Sky Captain is getting worse and getting worse all the time. <br /> <br /> Directing --- nothing. Everything is put in the special effects that suffer the story, acting and reigning, many suffer. Even the "Phantom Menace" performed better and it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a "0" from "10". Avoid paying theater prices and waiting for video release.
