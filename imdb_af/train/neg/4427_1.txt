Final score ... who cares - it's a reality program. It didn't hear any love for it, it pushed lazy TV viewers, put nothing in and got nothing out. <br /> <br /> "Joe Millionaire", the most blatant hidden reality show of all of them, is a television disaster of epic relationships. It's a watershed, a rock bottom, not just for Fox, but for the American public watching the roof one day. Your people should be ashamed of yourself. Because as much as Fox promotes this junk, it won't make money unless viewed by people (and the boy was, the final has almost Super Bowl numbers!?). It doesn't bother you because there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally attempted in those who are canceled while you are back and turn off this effortless cold game program? <br /> <br /> I was a strong supporter of Fox. It's the one of us like me who watches quality TV that helped to rebuild Fox in the days of Married ... with kids and the simpsons. Conveniently enough, none of the shows will make it 6 weeks with the current management. The Gail Berman "terrorist government" as it is often called. The network has waged war TV and, strangely enough, it's fans. The many people who helped build them in the beginning. Now we must not only fight for good performances, but we must fight against their own network. It raises the mind. Nothing Fox did in the past 3 years makes sense. From the cancellation of hits such as "Titus", "Futurama" and "John Doe" (NBC can revamp "Boomtown", but Fox can't make it heady to give the only decent show they are yet another shot this season) ?). And why they can do it all: the success of the litter like "Joe Millionaire". They can now say, "We don't need your TV fans, we have reality shows." They seem to have no idea that the big audience is unwavering and will leave them, the second to come the next riddle. To alienate their base will eventually kill the network as ABC has put it back. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a joke. Here we have a point of departure, in the now classic Fox gimmick, which promises us something else and edgy, but then something that does not differ in any way from "The Bachelor" or something on the big 3. Fox went off mainstream . The final and "twist" (quote / unquote) showed they have no ideas on their sleeve. Now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they all, will end the same cornball, fairy tale. We got a bunch of lazy aspiring actors that the network chose from millions of shots to fit their demographics like a high school bimbos, as if they love this Evan Marriott because ... because it was a competition and that is what you need to do it. Marriott itself is like a rusty Chro-Magnum man struggling to put together the simplest sentences. But how can the women (all the average to look ugly for the road - an important lesson is a guilty pleasure show like this) do not fall to Joe with such beautiful lines as "Look, you're not stupid." /> <br /> I thought people who watched this reality / dating / game show were just too lazy to change the channel, but to "Joe Millionaire" I think they should be really lacking in mind. Come on people, don't be more proud of yourself. Ask a little more about your entertainment than THIS. <br /> <br /> Boycott FOX.
