This movie is a very funny movie. The violence is bad, the acting is ... Well Dani, keep singing or screaming or whatever the hell you usually do. The random chicks that carry nothing are just to capture sexually frustrated goth lads. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. The story and characters can be very good if the director, the actors and other little ones make things better. But the movie is just bad, the only reason people like this piece are crazy is because it has Danni in it. This movie is probably the worst B-rate movie ever. And believe me, it's hard to reach, especially if you're competing with Def at Temptation and about sensible excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan, and so I see it just as another garbage movie ... a very bad one. If Dani made it as a comedy, then he goes well. Well done. More than that though, I lower it low because it is crappiness. Watch it when you are in a happy, happy, joy, joy mode, so you can laugh at everything or if you are high on various types of drugs.
