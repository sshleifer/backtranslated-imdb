Insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, but it can be considered amusing if you see it in the right mood. The special effects are tough, the dramatic play and the screenplay seem to miss some essential paragraphs! "The brain" takes place in a typical quiet American town, where each adolescent works in the same meal and where the kid stays on the high school cherry bombs in the toilet. It is here that a TV guru named Dr Blake and his beautiful pet brain begin their quest for national mental control. Under the label of "independent thinkers", a giant cheesy brain sends waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is it? Now it's up to the Meadowvale teenager to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are clear references to extraterrestrial life, but it's about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this? Unfortunately, there is not so much bloodshed and the "evil" brain looks like an excessive sock puppet. The only interesting element for horror buffs is a look at the movie and the crew that made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and author Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" (guilty pleasure from me) and "Pest". Both are much better movies and they wisely decided to thank the film industry. The best-known face in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, who will worship horror fans forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak offers the nudity factor and she is of course a good talent ?? She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which it is her "masterpiece". In her debut she was credited as a 'road model' and in '3 men and a baby', her character was called 'one of Jack's girls'. I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress?
