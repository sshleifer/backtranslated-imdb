Only a handful of the segments are doing here. A segment with a car dealership from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes his point, turning by turning to the final shot surrendering things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few of the tracks call Paris. The other is so distributed in theme, tone, dedication and production that you can also watch the year's best ads, 2006. It's all over the place. It doesn't develop over time, and nothing about the directors. No construction works successfully with the pieces. Tedium is in. I'm at one hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in some silly-commercial, over-the-ear vampire shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic. Fantasy shows I first think in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thank you J & E for the destruction of another movie) and then make too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you don't need a brand new crap to make your days extraordinary. Why does it divide by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine equates to vampires for some loser directors? Is there ever a genre more over-represented than the vampire movie. Every three years we get the same lame vampire clich√©s. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the switch from segment to segment is quite artificial. The transitions get lost. It does not feel intentional, it feels messy.
