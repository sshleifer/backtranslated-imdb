Charles Bronson continued his 80's slump with what might be his worst movie of the decade, if not ever. In it he plays a detective who is largely going to find and sell a pimp that had kidnapped an Asian girl to the highest bidder. This is a shameful attempt at action and is probably the most depressing movie ever made. Many people consider the Death Wish sequels as Bronson's worst movies. The Death Wish sequels were not good movies, but in most cases they were skilled and highly visible. Kinjite is, however, a completely dull thriller underlined by moderate racism and child molestation. It is really a reverberable movie and it is getting worse by trying to proclaim a "law and justice" personality that is too overwhelmed to really say anything. Indeed, the film with minor sex interrupted with Bronson starts raping the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater that I watched it just sailed on the uneasiness of this scene, just to grab the discomfort of the pimp raped by the girl in this movie. It has nothing but exploitation and the film was really not well written to rise over the exploding level and deliver something that would work. Bronson looks more like things, but it's clear that it's too tolerant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately his worst. The action ranges are also poor. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (Awful)
