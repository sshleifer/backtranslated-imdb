A noble effort, I think, but eventually a poor one. Before I saw this movie, I felt "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was unmovable. After I saw it, I still do it. Unfortunately, I just understand those who have read the story will understand what is going on, and they will be upset about the unnecessary review of the film (update from 1850 to 1970, from New York to London). Even the beautiful talents of Paul Scofield can't save what seems to me to be a good meaning, but the wrong attempt to film Melville's metaphysical classic film.
