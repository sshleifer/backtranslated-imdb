One would think (as I did) that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a movie should be at its least. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, I was badly wrong - it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It hurts my mind how a joke to the other can be so deep. It felt my pain to see these talented actors exercising one of the most positive lame scripts I had the misfortune to overcome. Because of the big names I have long since been through the film, but it has consistently failed to give any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this movie it is hard not to let go. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, big Hollywood productions that left me bitter than that. It's easily one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it --- I really did. But the Out-of-Towners eventually fail unhappy. If you really want time-effective entertainment, just take your money and watch it spin as you flush it in the toilet. Please don't see this movie.
