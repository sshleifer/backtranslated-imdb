Can I please first say that I felt so strong about this movie that I reported to IMDb specifically to review it. And my review? It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The synopsis of the movie sounds interesting-Nazis, occult, time travel, etc. But the movie plot couldn't bring all these elements together properly. Remember the episode of South Park that featured Manatees Family Guy using "idea balls"? Did these manatees also write badly? It's like the author, wanted to include all these different ideas, but has no idea how to link them all together, and to make things, make it even less sense, have a Donnie Darko esquire time travel theme up to including the end, destroying the chronology. <br /> <br /> I could tell from early on that it was a bad movie. Special effects were too low for anything better than straight to DVD. The acting wasn't good, but I saw fairer. I would praise the Nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the evil Nazi butcher was just comical. <br /> <br /> I don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even in the horror genre. But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or drama. If this story is well trusted, it would have been a good movie. But it's over. Waaaaay ear hyped.
