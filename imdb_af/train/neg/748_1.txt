I love movies, and I'll watch any movie all the way, just to give it a chance. I can finally say that I got a movie that I can't see throughout. The play is terribly inactive and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer geek doing it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and ..... the long screens of just ... running !! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG !!! I didn't even do it 15 minutes before I passed the DVD quickly. The screens with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of calling this "World War", calls this "Long Distance War". It costs $ 5 million to make! What they make the money, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> But on a positive note, one scene you have to look at is when strangers first kill people. It is hilarious, not because people die, but because they turn to the skeletons, they stumble for another 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So .... as I said, if you're a fan of boring, old, active movies, here's one for your DVD collection. But I didn't write it for you, I wrote it for the billions on billions of other people who would hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money <br /> <br /> I know it's at the book, but the book isn't that long, and I'm a complete bookworm / nerd / geek / whatever, but Why? Just get the Steven Spielberg version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than that! <br /> <br /> I give it a BIG, FAT NEWS 10.
