I remember that this show was on television when I was a kid in the early 1990s, and there was this rage over kids with goofy leotards doing Kung Fu on each other and riding in plastic dinosaurs. It was called watchmen. I remember that the little ones were going to beat each other and then the shirts and the things in the show were banned in many school districts across the country because this show had taught children to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never really thought of it as a show, especially when playing better like The Tick on Fox Kids. Most older teenagers looked at power carriers in a ridiculous and cowardly manner, and it is not difficult to wonder why. The footage is at best ridiculous. The colored rangers costumes look like things you are going to work on and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get the acting, and of course those who are really laughable. All the guys run around with earrings, half of them wear 90's mullets, and they wear the same clothes every day, then change into leotard with power rangers. <br /> <br /> The toys are especially ridiculous. , and was the joke of many late-night writers. And, of course, two of the worst movies ever made have two of the worst movies ever made based on this show. Almost every critic cast both the films and the performances on which they were based. <br /> <br /> Power rangers are nothing more than a bad television commercial for especially poor toy sales. As an adult, I don't look pretty much at it, but rather as another embarrassment to children in the 1990s, kids, fashion and guys' earrings.
