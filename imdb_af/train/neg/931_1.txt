I can't believe this wood-based and directional piece of click film was made. There are about four beautiful shots (the director should consider switching to still photography) and that's it. A strong cast was completely wasted, scenes repeatedly ended at the least interesting moments and the writing says nothing new. Please save yourself this movie.
