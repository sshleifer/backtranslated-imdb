Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most beautiful stands (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to his life in his skillful hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I was disappointed that Reitman couldn't take a pretty original plot (superhero, superhero got revenge on superpower) and made it into something nice. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in futility. The one-time pony plot is long after the first 20 minutes in the tooth. The movie can't decide if it's romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a flip-flop movie between both, and no aspect has been done very well. Uma Thurman is tops, as usual, and Luke Wilson also pulls down his role, even though his assassins are tired quickly. What is even more malicious is that in some scenes (such as when Uma bends over, a main board knocks through a wall), you feel a witty, giant Reitman opus shouting to get out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, as fast as the superheroine, whose movies disappoint in almost every respect.
