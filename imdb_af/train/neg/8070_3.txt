It's not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I found out this movie (we think) so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** IMPORTANT SPOILERS INSIDE *** <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is pretty simple after removing all the confusing unconscious dream states junk (95% of the movie.) <br /> <br /> Ignoring the junk, which really happened, is this: a Group of school friends go to a ravine one evening. They leave and get in a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. This is the simple cut-off version. (That's right, I said Sean carried with me) <br /> <br /> Just after the accident, Cassie was hospitalized between life and death until the end of the movie. This is where the dream begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continues after the accident with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 Weirdos and Jude) interacting with images affected by her mind (Sean, school and everything around her). The souls continue to do what they are defined as: Annie the cute chick, the 2 weirdo killers (of the opening scene), Father Jude still helps people. <br /> <br /> We are then very much taken long drive, shown a lot of the images (many of which my GF and I still can't connect), but all this means it's not Cassie's time to to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up in hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is again reality. She's OK. <br /> <br /> Then the director added a little extra spice by confusing us again by showing that a little dream piece is strangled in the wheelchair. But this part is actually just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, and is still busy with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions we didn't cover every little thing, but feel free to email us if you want. <br /> <br />
