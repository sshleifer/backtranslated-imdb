If you want to see a movie that was shot strangely, strangely lit, weird stories of these guys (and one woman) who like to split the shit, if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere from these two guys no, one a boxer and the other a gay man, then you should see this movie. <br /> <br /> After I watched this movie, I almost crushed and cut, as the director (of the movie) knocked hell out of me. <br /> <br /> It's a movie where one isn't meant to look for plot or for big acting, it's a movie to intervene and wonder. Many would like to see a plane crash or a train wreck. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie, a good movie, a B movie or even a mediocre movie, it's not the movie. <br /> <br /> Please don't warn anyone watching this movie beforehand. You might want to break at the end of the movie.
