The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a top box comedian, in other situations away from the Stooges. He had a definite record because he was very funny and smart. Moe and Larry and Shemp had known him or her for many years and liked his work. So what was going on on Earth when he joined the troop as the "third stooge"? Obviously nothing. In most of these "late Stooge" short shorts, more often than not, the boys explode or Joe against the other two and it is not an accurate Stooge label. "One for all, all for one, each for himself", to quirky of "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they benefit or beat each other, when the chips are actually off, keep them together and join each other's help . In this particular one, nothing happens. It's almost like a dog fight to watch, because one tries to cheat the other, or be mean and dirty, and not for comic effect. One can assume that there is something behind the scenes here, art mimics life. Perhaps there was actually why Besser didn't stay with Moe and Larry for a long time. Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
