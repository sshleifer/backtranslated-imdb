A movie with very little positive to say for that. <br /> <br /> First, it has zero tempo and is lacking in any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition to being remarkably slow, the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock of images over and over again. I lost the score how many times I saw that "field" at night or that bit of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has the fundamental mistake to think that if the audience does not know things, Gryp will be rather than just confused. So without a hint that there are any problems we suddenly find, marriage is not what it seems to be. We find that Jacob may be the worst farmer in the universe, as he seems to have no time on the farm and also bought land with a completely useless field. Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are countless other questions, some of which are later resolved in the movie, much later, too late. <br /> <br /> And at the end of the field. Horror filmmakers notice that large, lifeless objects are inherently scary? and even if they are meant to be a field big, they make it so. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of reasonableness when Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson ?? the policeman) suddenly accuses everything of the sun simply because she is on medication. <br /> <br /> With the full ten minutes plus looking for the fields that the missing child is looking for (he crawled the window? He's six months old). The film descends to a poorly written scene in a poorly written scene. Bad plinky plunge horror music fails to add sphere. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies can be amusing, but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
