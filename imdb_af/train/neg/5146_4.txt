For a long time I was looking forward to seeing this movie, here in Latin America, Japanese or any Eastern movies have no distribution in theaters. We can find some of the movies in some underground shops, and I just found Avalon. I expected something good, but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and pointless, just silly, with lots of useless scenes and a boring story. I waste my time even writing about this movie. Sorry, but the truth.
