Some people may say like 'Baby Geniuses' with his giant robot baby or 'Dumbo' with his psychedelic drug addict nightmare series, winning the most disturbing movie ever made for kids. You can say that too, but you'll be wrong. Look, because I'm bringing you: Santa Claus, the most helplessly spoken family movie ever since ... well, ever. <br /> <br /> Some of the opening styles that show children from different parts of the world are singing their thoughtless theme songs (this segment is serious, almost 20 freakin minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the exciting conclusion in which Merlin comes out of nowhere and saves the day (no matter, he is from Barcelona). This is the trauma of the children at its best. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just can't ... get ... not ... that ... reindeer ... laugh ... from ... of. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this thought-bending piece of garbage as you avoid a hungry whale during the season. Yet, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of persuasive flu are for you, I think you should try it. But really, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
