It's almost like two movies - one literate and tempting, the other stupid and clich√©. It is really a shame that all the problems were not worked out with the writing, but because of how fast most B-movies were written and produced, it is not too unusual. However, this is a great shame as it could be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, the good. The movie is original and includes World War II codebreakers. It's pretty fascinating and I like to watch the front man (Lee Bowman) step down as a master code breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the movie was very good. But now for the bad, the movie just went too long and lost about 50 minutes of steam. In addition, Jean Rogers' role as "kooky girlfriend" has to be one of the worst written and distracting roles in film history !! For every smart move made by Bowman, the idiot Rogers used to screw things up as a kind of deceptive "comedy relief". If her role was written intelligently, the overall movie would have improved tremendously! Instead, look at her, it's hard to understand how we actually won World War II !!
