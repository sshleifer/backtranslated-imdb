Throw this lamb dog a leg. Sooo bad ... you can look anyway. Col (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad man who is escaped by an excessive space commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Col is stealing a commute stealing on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring the villain back or dead. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger who insists on handling these two visitors from afar, far away. Costumes are shameful and the writing lacks intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran it. Law shows the only sign of trouble. It's hardly comical. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
