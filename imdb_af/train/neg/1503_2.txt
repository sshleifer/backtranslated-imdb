It's incredible! Fidani (who was also a spirit) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This movie has the original title of Leone's "Duck you sucker!" Stolen. but tells the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (indisputable Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). Everyone is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed in the lovely landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani wasn't able and at the same time. In the story some sort of illogical things happened (such as the discussion in the sheriff's house and the demented appearance of Butch Cassidy! Yes, really Butch Cassidy, portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd compilations, illogical plot, bad acting and an appearance of one of the most rewarded anchorman in the story of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Oh, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's big and terrible, but I'm sure he was just there for money, and playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DO NOT MISS !!!!!
