For Daniel Auteuil, 'Queen Margot' was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments were Chris Menges ('CrissCross' and 'A World Apart' cannot even be compared to this one) and Goran Bregovic for using a version of the same music theme of Queen Margot for this movie. the end of the movie). If it was an American pop movie, I wouldn't be surprised at all; But for a European movie with more independent actors and directors, a similar common approach to child abuse without original insight is very simple and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are those poor children who hate people to sell them and wait to be saved by someone. And finally there is the great hero who kills all the bad people and saves the poor children of bad guys. Each character is shown in simple black and white terms: good to evil. From the beginning I could also understand how the story would end. Is it the end of child sexual abuse history? I believe the difficult issue of child molestation and pedophilia is much more complex than depicted in this non-original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
