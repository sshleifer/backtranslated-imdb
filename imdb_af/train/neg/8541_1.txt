Welcome to movie 17 on the different classic 50 pack. Where we'll see, that's right. Another movie that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously, this movie got me so confused in the end, I thought I looked again "At Dawn they Sleep." The plot looks simple enough. Well, it's up to 3 seconds in the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then ... um .. exploded? I have no idea what happened. and it was in front of the screen. It's really sad when I can't even know what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl dies after he put his other girlfriend on the road to take pictures of something somewhere. so we don't get there until someone steals their jeep to drive 200 feet from the road to a town. suspect? nah. so they decide to stay with an old lady in this deserted town. and then there's blah blah stuff and blah blah talk. The man with the mustache goes out in the mist for some reason, even if the old lady doesn't tell him. He gets lost and finds his way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention, it's all after an incredibly useless 20 minutes of those staying in the home of a guy who looks like Casablanca's buggy-eyed guy. Then they go away. There is really no point in this scene. It's really just padding. if you cut it out, no one would be noticed or cared for. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was actually the best part of the movie. wait. let me repeat it. Actually, it was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that I had to look at IMDb to find out what happened. But of course no one else knows, I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> The last 30 minutes of the movie were obviously some of the most imaginative moments I've ever seen on film. They dressed her in a dress, he was kidnapped, then released, he returned to the house, and then the witches were in the house and it ended? seriously. I was almost never so confused in a movie. I mean, as bad as movies like "War of the Robots", make them at least SENSE. this movie doesn't even coincide with the ATTEMPT. the end was so confusing as the end of "at dawn they slept" and the plot was much more boring. This movie gets a 1 just for its mere "I have no idea what happened in this movie." Heksesberg "gets a confused movie keeper out of 10.
