The saddest part of this is the fact that it is 87 minutes, I will never return. I knew it was terrible about the visit, with the man dressed on the roof as a mad Indian captain. (See if they could get away with that in 2008). My 10-year-old son is really in baseball now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Although he seems to enjoy parts of it, I had to cringe when I heard the unnecessary dirty language. Bad, bad movie. It was a terrible ripoff of Bad News Bears. Totally shameless and completely predictable. I don't care for a predictable movie if it's done well, but this one was absolutely not.
