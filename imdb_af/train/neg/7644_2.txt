It was a long time ago, since I last saw a movie, so bad. The acting is very average, the story is very boring, and I have a loss for words about the performance. It was completely original. Oh, and it's so much a comedy like Clint Eastwood is a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the television program - where hell are you?) got it right - the role-play was 80% of our faces - forgotten actors. If they reload hope for a career, then I think this can never happen to their resume! The screenplay has the potential, but not 80% of the actors or the director (who is an actor and must be clear about being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than any of the rest. I'm sorry, but if you ever consider looking at it, I strongly recommend something less traumatic, because not only is it not a total loss of time, but also a poor example of how bad theater looks.
