Awwww .... yes, it's heart-warming and everything an unfortunate family gets is adopted by ABC / Sears and "refurbished their home." That's where the humanistic appeal ends. I liked it very much earlier, but now this show is disgustingly excessive. <br /> <br /> Ten needy families can get relatively luxurious homes with lots of treats for every family that splits every episode of this show. The people at Habitat For Humanity should shake their heads in disbelief. For example, does a healthy sixteen-year-old boy need to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom, or have his bed with the "Low Rider" hydraulics? Does the mother really have her dilapidated, non-running and rusty old overnight truck that is restored and pimped by some of the finest California-based custom workers? A new one would have done the job properly, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there is the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills. Even after the zaniacs left for "Makeover", someone earned another life. I doubt the friendly people at Social Services will see the humor in all these. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a rating for ABC, and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
