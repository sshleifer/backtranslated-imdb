This movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a science film. The worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme a terrible, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / unusual "vision" of the human future. <br /> <br /> Science fiction filmmakers (and writers), as geeks, take themselves very seriously based on the high shit-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just fixed it, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, have a little better understanding of the fact that they don't change the world with a profound " message. "<br /> <br /> Sci fi can definitely be successful at a serious level, as many good filmmakers have proven. But there is a big downside to the whole concept, represented by Robot Jox, with its low "future" lease (lonely design element: the bizarre, smooth billboard advertising everywhere encouraging women to have more babies) and his painfully heavy-handed "Iliad" parallels (He is called ACHILLES FOR RELATIONSHIPS! . <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're a crazy movie freak like me, this downside has a big upside down. I absolutely love movies like this, because bad movies are much more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good. It's kind of like a Lester Bangs approach to movie viewing, I think. <br /> <br /> Note: The lead role in this movie (Gary Graham? Is this his name? I refuse to look.) Is really not that bad. He made a shell of it. He is so cool, especially when he is drunk / overhanging.
