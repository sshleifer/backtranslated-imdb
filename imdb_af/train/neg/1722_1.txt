This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's VERY boring with very boring dialogue and has some very annoying characters and a laughable look. The only reason I watched this piece of garbage is because it was on the 8 disk scare I got. The plot is exuberant and completely silly like the final. No blood so, except some bloody marks on the animal, and some bloody gunshot wounds. The play is TERRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella is horrible as the sheriff and was pretty lazy and his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all. Mark Siegel was extremely annoying and was not very nice either. Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more than that. Richard Garrison is annoying and has not had chemistry with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is so here and has no chemistry with Richard. Overall Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! BOMB out of 5.
