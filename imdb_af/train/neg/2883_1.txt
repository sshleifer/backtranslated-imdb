This movie is just as terrible. It's so bad that I can carry nothing but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes are being reviewed correctly. Many slaughterhouse materials. Weird cuts and edits. No plot continuity. The play is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This bomb of a movie is, of course, made to make money without looking at the accuracy of the content. The camera's work is sometimes out of focus and always shaky. It looks like it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have Dennis Rader with life imprisonment, I wish they would also put the guys who made this horrible movie in jail. . <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this one first. I'll give it a negative star if I can.
