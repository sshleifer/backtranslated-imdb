Wow, I have just managed to watch this godly movie just after a few attempts, just to realize that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a straight-to-video sequel this year. <br /> <br /> Of all movies reviewed by MST3K, and they really work from the bottom of the run, and the reputation of bad Manos, 'Werewolf', 'The Incredibly Strange' and the lesser-known disasters like ' Laserblast ',' Zombie Nightmare '' and 'Time Chasers' - this must definitely be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they ever showed (making it perfect for riffing). Very simple, the movie is about a lot of Munchies-like gremlins on the outside, using people's desires for fame, fortune, skill and of course sex in ways that end with people being killed. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (for example, a test of machismo is illustrated by two guys fighting garden tools), the writing is so forced (as the often-described scene of a gremlin depends on the arm of a girl who would see it, if she had turned her head only a quarter on the left ... and this is not the first time in the movie, it happens), and the story is so ... seldom paid attention (so the MST3K riff about a "law in the future where movies by FILMmakers have to be made), that you are really rooting for the beautiful dolls to kill everyone on the screen. The worst movie ... ever .
