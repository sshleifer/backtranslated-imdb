This Hitchcock movie has little resemblance to its later suspension films and looks much more like a very old-fashioned moral story. A young couple gets a legacy they believe will make them happy. They spend the money all over the world and live a lot of hedonistic existence. But after a while the excitement begins to decline and the couple disappear and become useless in their existence. But if they aren't on a luxury ship, the ship sinks and loses everything - and eventually ends up happier because they appreciate life now! What a strange, stupid and beautiful movie! Personally, I want to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me unhappy! <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are relatively poor compared to later productions - a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.
