Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film in the Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system chip and smuggle it through an airport in a remote toy car. As a result of baggage confusion, Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) the car. She gives it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies arrive. The spies rent a home to collect every home in the area until they find the car. At home alone with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he steals a theft, but the spies always beat the police, while Alex is accused of making prank calls. The spies finally turned their attention to Alex, unaware that he had taken on devices to cleverly capture his entire house. Home Alone 3 wasn't terrible, but probably not made, you can't just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 has some funny parts, but I don't like when characters are changed in a movie series, look at their own risk.
