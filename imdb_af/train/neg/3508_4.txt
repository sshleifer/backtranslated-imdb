Despite the overwhelming cult followed for this sad "documentary," I must admit that we have left the film warmly, which has made our party so much more than a disturbing exploit as useful. It said, after we saw the wonderful theater music out there, we could appreciate what the film could be in secrecy. <br /> <br /> One of the suspects that most of us who have been actively involved in the movie might have had a nice treat. His cruel fans enjoy it destroyed by the awkward suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are just a mistake or two away from the deplorable fate of the two crazy women portrayed who live and contribute to a squalor who they cannot control or escape. <br /> <br /> The movie desperately leaves the viewer and wondering how someone can slip to this level of decline and, unlike the musical, offers no prudent clues or explanations, just a horror show that is not humorous. or insight is ignored. <br /> <br /> This soul, which makes the movie flat, makes the performance of the stage version (hopefully ultimately for cable) increasingly remarkable. Law II is true to almost every detail of the film being discussed, but strangely man's tragedy is art. More importantly, this act is preceded by a fine Law I where we meet the women before their decent in mutual enthusiasm, and are offered tips on how their isolated purgatory originated. In short, all that the FILM lacks. <br /> <br /> For the filmmakers' credit (or their successors), the excellent Criterion DVD edition includes out-and-out material that partially relieves the main film - behind the scenes photos, interviews, and comments - fill out some the empty spots in which the original editing consciously decided to leave in the pursuit of unsaturated horror and depression. They can't make the amateur movie itself satisfactory, but they can at least understand it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, it is just the remarkable play by book writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyrics Michael Korie, who rated the original GRUIS GARDENS above a single (generous) star.
