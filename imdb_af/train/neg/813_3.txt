The biggest one that puts hell out of me is that they say Zues take DUTCH instructions. But she speaks to him German. The 2 languishes are completely different, like saying, "Well, he takes French orders" and starts speaking Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is more like a comedy actor, not a detective in the slightest. The role does not fit him right, even if it is a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypical / predictable things. Typical comments or comebacks. <br /> <br /> If you don't look at those things, I think it's a nice movie to see if it's ever on TV. But I wouldn't suggest renting it.
