This movie had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, directors and editors dropped this movie seriously. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wood, very few of the characters are credible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever changed has just learned a few new editing techniques and wanted to talk about the movie. There are many quick 'flashing' changes in virtually every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic, but just as annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to keep this movie and expected it to be a decent resolution. to the breakdown of equilibrium, but unfortunately no, it made me feel like I was wasting my time and the filmmakers wasted their money.
