The point of departure, while not completely ridiculous, is certainly ridiculous. What had happened was that Tritter had to be messed up by the second meeting with Tritter. House rent an old and decipher Tritter. In real life, Tritter would have been suspended, the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court, with motivation and opportunity, and the hospital lawyers would have made Tritter and the particular department for which he worked. He would be in jail, as someone harassed House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The court case would have been Huis's nice settlement, enough to provide him properly with his age group. While driving a taxi somewhere, try to rehabilitate yourself by doing good to people for two years before people have plunged them to see them before.
