Like most people, I was drawn to buy this movie because of the pictures of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered over the box and the assumption (from the aforementioned photos and the title of the movie) that this film is all about the Cattle from the east kick in a hole for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> But to my disappointment, Chinese Hercules to Bolo Yeung what No Retreat No Surrender was, to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was to ... erm, Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure on video box, minimum real screen time! Oh yes! <br /> <br /> The storyline is pretty basic, but it was well done - peaceful kung fu warrior (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again. He then ran away to work as a laborer on a pier where he impressed his co-officers with his heavy bag raising, causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter (don't know how it works, but never don't mind). Meanwhile, the corrupt boss of the pier has an agreement with gang members, who use them exclusively from the pier. As a result, the workers are thrown on their ear and forced to live on the beach, joining together with their boss, the gangster boss and his Hulking Herman Bolo Yeung. <br /> <br /> While the movie was pretty vigilant (especially waiting for the next look at Bolo), I had some issues with it - firstly, the bad dubbing, but of course it's a given in the old kung fu movies. But also, the movie tended to drag between the various battles. And for the fighting scenes themselves, I found them to be long-standing, choreographically bad (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Very shot and sometimes performed by people who don't have any martial skills. In fact, most of the battles in this film were not 'battles' at all, only people were beaten without resisting! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen any other movies with this man, but I didn't root for him at any moment. Not only did he watch wimpy at all times and on the edge of tears, but I found his insistence that he was not fighting! I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved many people a lot of pain if he had done what we all know he will eventually do and fight! A further secret was why this whole community of people tied their hopes on a guy, they have never seen fights! <br /> <br /> The great savings in this movie were the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is he as big and brutal as ever, he has some good, funny lines and gives the rest of the role a master class on how to fight on film. The man harvest screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star. The man scared me out of life, but I'm sure I wasn't the only person who watched this movie that took root in the Bolo, even by the end! <br /> <br /> All in all, a below-average kung-fu movie has gained many great notches due to your know-how. I've never met anyone who didn't think Bolo Yeung was great. The man is a legend !!
