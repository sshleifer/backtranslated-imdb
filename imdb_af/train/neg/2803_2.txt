Taking into account the boundaries of this film (The whole movie in one institution - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors in total), it had to be made much better. If you have these limits to make a movie, how can the lighting be so bad? And the actors were horrible, played a hair under the acting in Clerks, except it was a pleasant movie, it had nothing. Well, it tried, but really failed. <br /> <br /> It's trying to be self-referenced in a few parts, but the lines were so badly given by the actors that it was just bad. And the main character Neal man, who is a pathetic loser. Clearly, 10 people made this movie and everyone knew each other, and that was probably a real rock group they had, but unfortunately these people really have no idea how terrible they are anywhere. It was made in 2005, but everyone looks so funny, it just bangs before the grunge era. Fortunately, I didn't pay to see it (Starz on Demand returns!) But it wasn't under the title "The Possessed" Studio 666, no matter what you do, it can't help it no. It can be a much better made movie. There is no excuse for this bad movie production when you have the obvious limited parameters that the filmmakers had when they did. Working within the bounds, you need to make the things you can control and the things you can do with the best you can. Instead, they thought mediocrity would be good enough. And that music video, wow, it was bad, I got trapped by it. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair, if you're in the entire b-movie, I think you're going to see it. .
