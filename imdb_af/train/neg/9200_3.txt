One wonders how the writing was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other artists do an OK job, but as it is not comedy, romantic thriller or anything else, it's all disappointing. <br /> <br /> One feels that one of the threads has been pursued, it could have been something worth it. However, it is interesting to see a real turkey of a story directly involved in the war just before the US. I wonder if the surrounding politics has anything to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes, but ending with something no one likes. <br /> <br /> However, it has historical value.
