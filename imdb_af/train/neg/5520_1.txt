This movie is portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. This is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make such a movie as they should be enough to reflect the real intentions of the movie in the trailer. I wouldn't have seen this movie if I knew it. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intent of a movie. I'm tired of it. I really wanted a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. It's a few days and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more disappointed in a movie, and I have never written a comment on a bad movie. I really think real deception was involved in this trailer, because if they showed the real intent of the movie, no one would have seen it.
