I don't know where to start; the acting, the special effects and the writing all go as badly as you possibly can imagine. I can't believe the production staff reached a point where they said, "Our work is finished, time for its release." I'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the UK. I would actually recommend watching this movie just so you can appreciate how good most movies are. <br /> <br /> I don't know how any of the other IMDb users can find it scary as the "terrifying" dinosaurs waddle down corridors with flowing rubber arms.
