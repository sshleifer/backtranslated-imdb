We expected something great when we saw this bomb. It's basically a Broadway movie-based game. The music is simply awful. There is not one unforgettable song in the movie - did any hits from this movie have been heard? You won't because there isn't any. Some of the musical numbers go so long that I got up to go to the toilet and get some popcorn and it still goes when I get back! If their good songs were good - but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible character development. The lead was praised for her singing, but sounded like she was shouting every song - it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone except the hard-Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most overestimated movie I've ever seen in my life. A complete means of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover - which wasn't enough on the screen and whose character wasn't developed enough. Rent the video and you will agree - this movie was an expensive, produced, seasoned dog.
