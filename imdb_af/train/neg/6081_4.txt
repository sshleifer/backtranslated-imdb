A typical 70-year-old Italian comedy movie, original and good music, but with some features, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and sometimes confused story (eg the role of the wolf dog and where does the boy come from? <br /> <br /> The reason why it is still (relatively) well-known and sought after is probably the latest scenes (including typical 70s pseudo-coitus) that include an 11 and 13 year old girl. with an older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it is interesting from a socio-political point of view to see how these representations of many young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the USA) 30 years ago. , while it's more than taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of one girl (Laura) by the other two characters, and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of an aspect of teen life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not develop until the end of the film and is already very experienced in the erotic arts. There is no age for her: she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charm, but in the end it is only used and ends the film that cries like the little girl she really is. The boy is a very despicable bully, while Laura is attacked as a very naive and weak victim.
