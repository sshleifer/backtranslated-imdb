Dreck talks about three beautiful women in California who are going to cover a festival (or something). All the hotels were booked so they had to spend the night in a creepy old house. What they don't know is that there is a creepy resident who likes to kill. <br /> <br /> Yawn. Drilling, useless, completely silly "horror" movie. Bach and her two friends are definitely beautiful, but the movie itself is boring! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are completely empty. The last "revelation" is pleasantly predictable and there is no blood or gore to keep you on the road. There are some expected female nudity, but it's not enough to save it. Drilling, useless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
