I died to see it as soon as I saw the ridiculous Meatball poster and it had split up that it had to be the best satire ever. What a brilliant idea for a satire - the genre is great. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think everyone involved is probably realizing) is a catalog of missed opportunities, not-many performances and (thank you!) A few extremely hilarious, inspired pieces. Janeane Garafolo, who is very conspicuous, looks really bad here, probably because she's struggling to make her flat roll funny. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to look, trying hard to be funny and looks like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny, just to make her laugh, but somehow her segment accelerates snowball in something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teenage ways and was sexy like hell, the other guys are really funny too (the naughty kids). I think the problem is that the director just doesn't move the right things. He started very deadpan, and it puts the monotonous. But when he makes things really outrageous (the drug order is the second funniest moment I've had in movies all year round, the first one comes in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL ABOUT THE GUY, who complains about the movie IN & OUT), it's just funny. I wanted to work this movie so badly, but it just didn't. The clothes and styling for 1981 is 99.9% PERFECT, and the very few songs used are also perfect. It ends up as a medium-bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustrating, elongated sketches.
