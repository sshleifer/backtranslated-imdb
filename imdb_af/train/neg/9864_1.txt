As a gamer I can't say I like this movie. The fact is, I hate hate right. I tried to see it as openly as possible, but if that led to it, it made me feel insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me there are several reasons why. <br /> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I met a lot of players, from all walks of life. I don't know anyone acting like any of the characters in the movie. It is as if the producers of the movie have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and let them all sit in 5 people. Most gamers are rather social people, some with fairly active lives. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The mockumentary style is badly suited to the subject of the movie. A real documentary on gamers actually works better. Although it looks good (I am neatly put together), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also looks like there is no real world context. Gamers swear I'll admit it, but we don't have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. The humor is missing. While self-mutilating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups I've experienced, it's less self-evaluation, and more like toilet humor. Likewise, much of the gamer's humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most gamers will turn on everyone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: accuracy. I don't mean rules, but rather dynamics. This movie will always be compared to the even lower budget movies The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, which both portray players as real people playing a real game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie offers a situation where you want to beat the players senseless versus The Gamers, where you can say something: "Huh, I know such a man ... Yes, it's definitely like Gary."
