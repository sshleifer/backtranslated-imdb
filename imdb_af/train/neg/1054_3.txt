Rural family drama - perhaps a nod to "Ordinary People" - relates to a young boy who withdraws from himself after seriously injuring his older brother in a shooting accident. Despite the indifferent subject (given ruthless glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there is some dynamism in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to control the situation make the film a stultifying experience. Featuring Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the movie, the movie is almost a small-scale reunion of "The Natural". Unfortunately, this project did not get the necessary talent behind the camera to really portray a grabbing, memorable picture. * 1/2 of ****
