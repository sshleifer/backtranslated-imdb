There is a scene near the start of a shooting where horses run. If something red catches your eye, it is because a white car is parked behind the forest next to the route. I thought I saw badly, but that's it. A white mate in a western. Didn't they catch it? Oh, and I pay top dollar when renting. This will make you want to grab your friends and let them all sit 10 big and make a better movie. The talk was so slow, the acting was mostly OK, but could not be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming. There is a door at the sheriff that looks like a door today with the particular trim. I say look at this movie, and move Cabin boy in # 2 at worst of all time.
