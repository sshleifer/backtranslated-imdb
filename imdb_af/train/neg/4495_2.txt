Spoilers from both this and The Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I liked a lot about the original Matrix. It wasn't a deep movie, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was pretty good, fun, and I have a soft place for Hong Kong battles. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life. of the rather unlucky cube worker Anderson. Throughout the day, corporate drones, and at night, brave hacker. Eventually he is eventually forced to choose between these lives through his actions - he becomes an out-of-town to fight the machine, or he returns to the safe, forgetful world in which he started. Interestingly, he discovers that when one of the illusions is shaved, life struggles. He has his girlfriend at his side and his boyfriends, but he eats processed swallows, swears in and lives in a truly oblique machine. Yet the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of that first movie lies in the "what if it's me" questions raised in the viewer's mind. What if _I_ was able to be impossible? What if I was the one? It doesn't matter how much you like the One example, with a cool title like that. <br /> <br /> Also, Agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, embodying all the fear of authority We carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator and unmerciful. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This movie fails to completely go through the ideas of the original movie, and it does so with such a lack of gusto, such a poor writing and such poor editing that I don't can believe they have planned these changes. When the dialogue is on a fifth level, with several long words randomly, I find it hard to believe they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My brief list of characterization errors: <br /> <br /> The Oracle goes from generously helpful, as well as deceptively, to completely obstructive without any real reason. <br /> <br /> Large "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without need - for example, the keymaster was a cute idea, but not as interesting. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses its "adviser" role and gets nothing to replace it. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not particularly enjoyable, or would you really be the people of the world. <br /> <br /> Special Effect Problems: <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are useless and intermitable. In the matrix you felt that Neo could lose, and that he had to become something bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is simply the standpoint of a particularly poorly confronted video game. <br /> <br /> The battle on the highway seems pretty fake, and not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fighting scenes were unmistakable. <br /> <br /> The rave went too long - everyone in my drive at the theater watched their watch. Not because we care about good dancing and good orgies, but because we didn't know about the people pictured, we didn't care either. <br /> <br /> Whatever the hack has been, the creator's soliloquy, must be blacklisted from the business. It turned, using words that the writer clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a pacing killer. The creator's speech could be done in a tenth of the time, and with more danger than "Zion exists to give rebels a place so they don't destroy the Matrix. There are now too many people who don't believe The matrix is ​​in danger of holding and killing everyone, and the earth cannot support even the people of Zion, let alone the other, you can choose one Zion to form the new Zion, while I remember the memories of the people currently in the Matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we have a long, drawn bunch of twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcription and try to break down the sentences. Each one is too long through various clauses and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw the third, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, it is over. It doesn't save this turkey. <br /> <br /> The judges who feel that the second and third movies were "deep" should see some real deep movies. Perhaps a book or two reads about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This movie is just not hard to understand, but it's hard to stomach. <br /> <br /> Scott
