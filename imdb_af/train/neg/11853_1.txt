Let's see it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight compared to dramatic movies (just look at the Oscar nominations every year). But the goods are really an art form. Look at "When Harry With Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle", and classic like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie seeks to create something that looks like a romantic comedy. But no one believes the romance between the main characters, and there's nothing funny about making the big shortcomings. Modine is over to be a leading man - especially a romantic lead. I'm sure as Executive Producer, he had the means - but not the good sense - to throw himself. And Gershon ... I see possibilities of some comic talent, but she had no writing and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Point Lose. <br /> <br /> Others put it, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly thought out, poorly executed; the actors are terribly disappointed; and the characters, well, we just don't give a cause for them. <br /> <br /> It's not an art form. Go rent "Moonstruck" again.
