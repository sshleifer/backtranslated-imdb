"The house of the spirits" is very terrible. I live in South America, in a country that had a military dictatorship, just like the one trying to describe the film, and though everyone knows that movies are far from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as ignorant a judgment. Things are not as simple and linear as they appear here, and of course the political process is much more complicated and interesting that the plot in "The House ...". If you can't show that on-screen complexity is better, it doesn't make a movie at all. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the film, without so many communities. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda might appear in parrots and palm trees. If you talk about certain things, don't just be careful, but respect your public's intelligence.
