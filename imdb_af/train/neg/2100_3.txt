You'd think the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough to do nothing. However, this documentary wants to throw everything in the lightest possible light. It talks about the risks associated with the moon module and calls Armstrong's almost fatal accident with the exercise vehicle, as if the coach and the spacecraft were dealing with each other. This causes the computer overload problem (the 1202 and 1201 alarms) during the final landing sequence to sound like a near-catastrophe, when it was just a nuisance and not a risk to the crew. And it takes the "thirty seconds" call to leave 30 seconds of fuel before it runs out, when it's actually 30 seconds before an abortion is compulsory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go for "From Earth to Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
