I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Kandians, but I found this show not to be funny at all. Producers and role players are probably happy to get both bad and good feedback, as it is so talked about! I was ready for stereotyping and having no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, it is usually true. But there was really nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. The "fresh from the boat" dad, who doesn't understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who is incidentally a terrible actress) and the young, modern Indian man who tries to manage his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor, I just see him better ). /> <br /> It is very customizable and the dialogue doesn't flow well. There was so much potential for such a thing, but unfortunately I think it fails, and I don't really look at another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, she's always a treat and natural to everything she does, badly her daughter in the show, doesn't have the same acting abilities!
