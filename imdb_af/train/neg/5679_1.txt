I was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the movie that I was sick in my stomach and eventually closed the movie. How someone can give this movie more than a 1 baffles score. I know the intention of the movie is to shock, but to show real footage of a living dog (hold back as I type). PLEASE! I closed it to the scene with the dissolving baby. I covered my eyes most of the time until that time. No wonder this movie was found at the bargain in HMV. I really have no desire to see any other movie by this Uwe person. Anyone who needed it needed therapy. Period.
