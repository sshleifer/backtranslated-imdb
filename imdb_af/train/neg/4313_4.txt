Like last year, I didn't get it right. Good, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely involved. Or rather, out of all the drills packed into the theater, at least he wasn't in the Top 10 Most Boring. Many of the presenters, however, were in this prestigious Top 10. I didn't know that the whole thing was done by autocue (although I knew it was written), but it was really awful to see these so-called actors not expressing can give, look away from the visit and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there is no director, she is gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches were long and annoying, Beyonce Knowles had some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and cuts. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter Award. <br /> <br /> To help me write this review, I would like to thank my mom, dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for anyone who believes in me and would like to point out that I am a have high metabolism and of course I did not hunger for a month. I'm not going to cry ... thank you.
