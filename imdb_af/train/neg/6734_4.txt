I found this movie to be a good idea, which didn't deliver. They seem to have found a way to build tension, but couldn't make their payouts very good. In one case, the police are on the clock to find the kidnappers' hiding place. They go from dentist to dentist to adjust a dental record. At the same time, the abducted man (Mason) escapes through the elevator. After all the building, the police arrived at the same time as he was released, which is the least anti-climate. There are also great narrative scenes that take us "within the mind" of the terrorist man and woman, which detracts from the tension rather than add to it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear, as Hitchcock has proven time and again, is far more effective. The biggest disappointment is putting the whole movie and getting the quick, fairly easy end. I mean it just ... "ends" in a snore.
