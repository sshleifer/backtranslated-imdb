"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. While these movies are more viewable than their 1914 counterparts, it seems to be below average. The string with the double folded vault and the hard luck that Charlie wakes up is in a dream in which he caresses the headdress's hair, just to push the head of a mop he used as a quasi. pillow is both classic Chaplin moments. They are ironically the beginning and the end. The remedy is completed to fight with the rival accomplice officer and clear a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the greatest physical appearance of this movie, and Charlie uses it to an expert comic effect whether it is the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to do Charlie's alter-ego what he wants him to do, but not his own two hands. Interesting things, but there is better.
