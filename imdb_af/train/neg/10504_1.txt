I couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it. It's a BIG combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. The shots used are disgusting, breaking the 180 degree angle all the time. My head hurts, trying to see that burden of "knowing what". Dirty on the "mystery machine" window makes you see light from the lights on the windows ... annoying. What else ... it is so badly framed all the time that it just makes you want to scream for that lady who is driving there. I only targeted short films, but I'm pretty sure I'll be better than a feature film ... the story is incredible. Just the long French kiss scene at the beginning tells you that it will be very terrible. So pretty much, try to avoid these really bad movies at all costs, this will save you the $ 5 or so for the rent, and that 1h30 hours of your life you will never come back ...
