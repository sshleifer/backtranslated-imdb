I'm surprised this movie has been rated so high, but if I go with typical grade scale 71, it's a c or d, maybe it's good, but this movie was just a typical thriller except annoyingly slow and unrealistic. Not that a typical thriller is realistic, but this one tried to try, but the woman who was attacked did not charge because she did not want to cross a court, although she would put the man in her arm. , shed the shit out of her and raped her for life, but also protected the advocate who had his feelings and his family, not just random people she didn't even know. There were other similar problems with the movie that would have been if there was some kind of morale to take away from the movie, but the few moral questions thought it was right to kill / beat Kady before doing anything illegal has. offered a bit aside because Kady was finally just a crazy bastard bent on revenge. So surely the lawyer was justified in protecting his family because he was waiting for Kady to rape his daughter so that he could do something lawful, would it be a bit absurd. So now I've just played more of my life for this silly movie. So don't see it that way, at least your life won't be played and so my 2 1/2 hours mean something.
