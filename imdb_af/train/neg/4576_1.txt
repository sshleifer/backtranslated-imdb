At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought-provoking. Of course, if something elicits, think it, then it can be looked at. The reality is this film combines metaphysics with insinuation and baseless conclusions. The link that "What the Bleep ..." would have you see between science and spirituality is not really rooted in science. The transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group of crime in a given area, Washington D.C., can reduce in this case. In fact, the crime rate for HRA (murder, murder and assault) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 ?? 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in the murder rate during the study. In fact, every demand that metaphysics connects to science can and is uncovered. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor effort to indoctrinate people or a joke. Anyway, I suggest you don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long, winding film about science that can evoke thoughts, consider Mindwalk (1990).
