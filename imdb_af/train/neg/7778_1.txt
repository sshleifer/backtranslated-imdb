It must be the cutest, dumbest, most delayed monster movie of all time. It is a complete joke that it even came across in theaters. It's like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown into a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. The people involved in this moronic heap of waste should be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before filming. How else can one explain the absolute and sheer stupidity that this bucket contains. Don't waste a moment on your life. Don't even waste your time sending a review.
