Let's hope this is the final nightmare. This is an indication of a bad thing. Well, there is still some pleasure to have, but only in the most common sense. Rachel Talalay was there for the duration of this franchise, was on the production staff and even produced. I don't know what she thinks, but this debacle comes complete with the human video games boy and a guest look <br /> <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had an idea of ​​what she thought when writing this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than a glorified popcorn movie rather than any resemblance to horror, with the intricate use of a 3D end. Are those glasses not fine? And you get to keep them! That's the equivalent of, you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich. Here is 10 cents. Now, don't you feel special! Sorry, but for me it didn't just make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy's has another facial. This one was for the worst, I think. All the beautiful artworks that have gone into the earlier films in his "look" have been replaced by a distinctly cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. He looks ... less like the burnt assume he's supposed to be, and more like he has a skin disorder. Changing the pilot's makeup as far into a series is about the same level as changing the main actor. But wait! They did it and did it. So I think it doesn't matter. But that mattered to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... another low-rent monster like the Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic this series of promises; mystery with which you can only hope the authors thought, was a spectacular one-liners and clever repartee (unfortunately it broke on both accounts). <br /> <br /> So, there is nothing more to say than grabbing the popcorn and getting ready to laugh because there wasn't a scary or exciting moment in this whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
