The ONLY MOVIE is flash pages of the first Boogeyman movie, as well as inexplicable footage of another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love movie Brainwaves. It was completed with some more current (from the early 90's anyway) footage that was boring, poorly acted and cheaply shot. Not only is the film almost totally flashing, they repeat the same flashbacks through the film. So you see the recycled footage over and over, as if you haven't seen it yet. As if the originals were not bad enough. I have never seen such a movie so full. Someone has milked the last dollar out of these movies. Total ripoff. And talking about stuffing ... why do I have to write 10 lines about this trash? If I can convey that it is rubbish in 2 lines, it should be enough.
