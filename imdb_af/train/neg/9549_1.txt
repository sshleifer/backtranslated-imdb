I wondered why John Wood didn't play Dr Falken until I watched the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad movie. Please do not look at this movie. Hire the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I also didn't like the bending of the plot to the beating-the-terrorist threat idea. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000's of the heads of the US. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorists in training before they were a threat. Aside from politics, one of the good aspects of the first film was the fact that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of ​​the endless war in the end. No such insight is offered in this movie.
