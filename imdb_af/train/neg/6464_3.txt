Watching Marlen Brando on the screen is like watching a master carpenter watching intricate details in a piece of mahogany. Brando's play is the only thing that makes this movie watch. The plot is null and void (not slips). The other big names actors seem to be desperate efforts to give the characters a portrayal of humanity. These characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either mediocre or just awful. The director throws over freeze-frame and slow-motion shots with impunity. The random music is cartoon and destroys a hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I'm really looking for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was far away. The venerable Brando couldn't break away from the terrible rags he had poured out on him. I heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "relentlessly funny" ... It's not. David Lynch movies are worn out of bad creativity - this film is by no means creative. And don't confuse indifference with stupidity.
