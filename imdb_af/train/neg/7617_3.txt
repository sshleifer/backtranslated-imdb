It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is definitely worse. This movie is more funny and ridiculous than scary. I laughed most of the time watching it. Low quality effects (if you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about and how low quality it is), bad actors (I hear from them for the first time) and it seems shot by an amateur camcorder (so It looks more like a TV show, than a movie. But at least I had the patience to see it to the end. Like comedies? Beware. Want horror? Watch Ju-On: The grudge or another good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I talk about Diablo's legend, I don't even know if I can classify it into a Horror genre. Just a low budget chess. <br /> <br /> I rate it 3 out of 10
