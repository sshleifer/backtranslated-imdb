After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time to watch. Well, I don't know why I'm bothering. This family was basically entrusted with a clue that led to a huge stash of ancient treasures hidden by the Knights Templar during the Independent War. Apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did Knights say that the treasure of Europe is moving to America? How did Nic Cages character find out that "Charlotte" was a ship? How do they realize all the clues and puzzles in about a minute? And how can two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded piece of paper in the world? These are just a few of the plot holes in this inane piece of Hollywood action that went wrong. Cage is in some big action movies - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - so why did he let himself down? Is he getting too old? His character is pretty annoying. Somehow, this 'ordinary' man steals the Independent Declaration, expires thieves with guns, escapes from the FBI and generally looks invincible. The whole movie doesn't really make sense and it was quite a disappointment.
