An okay movie, with a good leading lady, but a terrible front man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the man, is a very bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the film's saving grace. She is the best actor of the bunch. <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE * the first comment, by the co-author who had the movie (and according to his IMDB.com account wrote only ONE review - and guess which movie?) is of course. a plant. While the movie was shot beautifully, it was by no means subtle or large or any other hypobolic descriptions the judge used. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a big scourge. It offers all sorts of sexual situations, but never goes along with them. Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the "naughty bits", it's worked out. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a bit indifferent and the end and much of the third action is really a big mess. There is, of course, a quarrel as each movie is needed to make a turn. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
