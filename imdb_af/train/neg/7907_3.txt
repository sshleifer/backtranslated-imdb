An excellent performance by Alix Elias emphasizes an otherwise misguided and confused hope of drinking. I saw this movie, maybe 12 times, and with each run I find less and less fun. Why are Munchies so desirable? Has it ever been explained? Are they a reflection of our unrelenting, drunk 'animals themselves?' If so, doesn't it make it clearer? Why don't you just pick a touch of the subtlety that botheres this movie, and make the connection explicit? Another part of this movie that doesn't lead me to end - motorcycles. The jacket carrying the little monster on the front looks like it's a street traveler. The sunglasses say "pretty cute man." With all this, I'm ready for Easy Rider at the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Hold on to the Gremlins range if you are a fan of small, smart cracks, reptile puppets - this will give you the treatment you deserve.
