Certainly, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we really enjoy them. However, it wasn't even a guilty pleasure, it was just a treasure. Some old, vince offerings, enough to make himself the main character, while probably getting drunk / high - probably both - and making a movie was a good idea. He then continued to show his writing to equally tall / drunk individuals. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and original, I couldn't get it by 20 minutes before it turned off. This makes you serve, like Citizen Kane. Batman? WTF ... Some guy walking around with a bat, really original. Almost as good as calling him a fat man, and a fat man was walking around in a superhero outfit.
