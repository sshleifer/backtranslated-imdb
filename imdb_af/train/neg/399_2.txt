This picture started with good intentions, Bacon the scientist to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is cute as usual in her role. It's all apart, it's your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundtrack with special effects in general, less any kind of humor, white or soul. In other words, don't waste your time watching it. Get the audio cassette tape with John DeLancie as the invisible man instead, also with Leonard Nimoy. Now it was good, and HG Wells was well served, unlike this mess.
