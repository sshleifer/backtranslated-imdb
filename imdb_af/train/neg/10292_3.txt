It has its merit; Morvern Callar is both the merit and the disappointment. She is so mysterious, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost person who makes her so far and unreliable? Or is she, as one reviewer, called her a revolutionary? Personally, I call her dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern completely disengages herself. Throwing away her boyfriend, not the family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, is selfish on a trip to Spain. She looks so without any relative human greed. The only element that will enable the audience to see one's side is her good friend she is going on holiday with. Although at the end her friend is being dumped and Morvern has nothing to do with her. She could also have killed herself. <br /> <br /> Despite being able to make Spain look as slender as the UK, the directors' shots were great. The lighting and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame that the movie has nothing that interests you. It's just over 90 minutes, but feels much longer. They make it possible to make Morvern interesting to grab your attention, but do nothing with her, but alienate her more from you to the point where you don't care about the characters or the movie.
