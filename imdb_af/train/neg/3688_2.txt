As usual, I watched this movie for A.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this movie because it would be successful. But luckily or unfortunately, the film was a failure. Then he delivered a hit with Chandramukhi. I'm eagerly waiting for his future Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I read the other user's comments on Rajni. I found it interesting, as the user is also from TN. Rajni is one actor who, in my opinion, does not act from his heart. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we should appreciate Rajni for his strong going at his age. <br /> <br /> Any way, I have to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so wish you luck Rajni ...... .....
