Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me this has led to some terrible spending money, but also some good laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movies we have hired. The plot is over, the whole takes your friends in the woods and never back, it's very old. The prettiest part of the movie looks like you are visiting the local butcher shop, except a little more dirty and with blood on the play that is looking for meat. And if somebody ever was afraid of this movie, they should stay with Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good thing about the movie is that the two girls in it are pretty hot, one better than the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good thing is that this movie is sometimes so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like to act or rent horrible, but I do not see the fun, but I see the amount of effort these people put in there and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth the rent . Only you are too mature to recommend it. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy to laugh at it, I'll give it a 8.5.
