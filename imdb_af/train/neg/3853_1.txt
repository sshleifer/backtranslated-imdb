I think Jason Lee has great potential, but it was the wrong vehicle in which he tried to break out as a star. The plot is terrible, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I thought for relief, because in retrospect they were pretty nice jokes. I was scared of Fletch's future and had to comfort myself that it was the movie that was wrong, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are warm, but I recommend watching the silence. photos on this site to find out, instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star.
