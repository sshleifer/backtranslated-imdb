I don't like Sean Penn's direction, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no core, it is colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that spends most of Penn's work, its latest work, even more than the previous one. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, looks such a fundamental banal product, apparently to some degree of honesty, but ultimately it is glorified for the most part, and moralistic as Hallmark charts a line of Hell's Angels - Greetings developed, and let me long for the redemption days, which is a fine film. Viggo Mortensen's play is much, much more credible than the ridiculous Eastern promises he made with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is aimlessly senseless and seems like an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, proving he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A suspected 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap.
