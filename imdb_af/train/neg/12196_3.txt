The actors played a very good job - especially the mother. But as the movie progressed, I found I watched it more for their acting and not because I cared for the least. And sometimes I feel irritated by the irresponsible and hands-off approach to parenting that is shown time and time again. The daughter is a 17-year-old shallow shank whose main ambition in life covers famous men and becomes a dancing nip hood (complete with a lot of "outside"). The boy is a man with a low self-esteem who looks very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much so that he throws a drug party late in the movie. The husband and wife are both bored, but rather than putting energy into their old relationship, they will rather look for new partners (although the woman chooses poorly, because the man she throws herself is gay --- OOPS!). I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such a flat bump. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the absolute banality and persistence of the capitalist system. Since these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, it seems dishonest.
