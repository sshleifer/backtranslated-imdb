Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there. He was good at Goldeneye and made a nice Bond villa in The Living Daylights and appeared in several other films. One thing he can't do is a movie as the lead role, which he is in this extremely bad revenge film in Malta. Joe's partner died, killing the killer's brother and accompanying the murderer to Italy, but some guys caused the plane to sit in Malta and escape the killer. The rest of the movie is that Joe Don is pursuing the killer here and there, Joe Don is detained several times, Joe Don tortures a bartendar and is interrupted and so on. The movie is pretty bad and you will not find yourself attracting Joe Don's character. You will be surprised at how many times Joe Don gets the hero, and it is incompetent. The coronation part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer across Malta with the killer in a priesthood and then comes in boats and chases them all over Malta. This movie also has one of the worst closing lines ever to end a movie.
