Quirky, independent, theater, Christian Slater - that's what made me discover a jewel of a movie for an hour. Son, I was disappointed. Julian Po never gets over himself. The film is relentlessly self-conscious. I found myself unable to suspend unbelief for a moment. The exaggerated, obviously theatrical sets, the exaggerated, obviously acting, the exaggerated, naturally theatrical direction - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories need not be delivered. And it's hard to feel much for Julian Po, because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girl, the annoying town lover, the idiotic minister, the bitter children - why would anyone, especially someone with a lifelong ambition to come to the sea (Slater's character) decide to stay so stupid?
