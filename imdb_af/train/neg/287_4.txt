As an Altman fan, I've been looking for this movie for years and thought that with such a big roll it should be at least brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It's one of Altman's abused mishmashes, thrown together and thrown improvisationally (or so it feels) hoping it all gets together in the room. It is not so. <br /> <br /> Like Maltin shows, this turkey is only known for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, which releases the vets around her. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (It's pretty easy to do - it's never been released on video - to my knowledge - and its cable appearance has the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
