This is a classic example of an increasing problem with movies. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? What does that mean? This movie is not alone. Most movies now look to do this. For 2 years I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that a city rock can take behind the actors, drowns the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting in this movie, because in the English version the woman always muttered. I was hoping Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, you will speak or get the marbles out of your mouth." If you watch it on DVD and you even have high school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 because Reno was so nice in Leon. People rave about the scenery, but I saw it on a TV and I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
