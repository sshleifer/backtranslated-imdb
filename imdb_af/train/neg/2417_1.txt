It was undoubtedly the worst thing I ever spent money on. I feel dirty to admit that I have rented this movie and actually paid money to see it. It does not even evaluate trash. No no. It is the juice collected at the bottom of industrial dumpsters, located in especially dirty areas after an exceptionally humid summer. To name it, garbage will be everywhere. It was so bad, I felt I had to register with IMDb and warn my fellow man. This luvahire character claims this movie is wonderful. One must question his understanding of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky did a very good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director suggested his audience, he was on every sentence spoken by Ricky, or alternately broken into uncontrollable moments when most directors wanted a more bleak response from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> "I am an aspiring actor I will be playing at my school myself and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it is not easy to be emotionally in a scene. gives props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it. "<br /> <br /> Wow. I must also give props to actors who can draw emotional scenes. Luvahire, you might want to look at another line of work, if you think these chuckleheads have pulled it off. Yet they can help you if you have to cry. Just look at the movie. ha. ha. ha. <br /> <br /> "BRING ON THE SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would fail you solely on this comment. <br /> <br /> I'm too disgusting to continue. I will now send the film to my colleague, Mr. Bangla, switch over. <br /> <br /> How much! Having read so far, I take it for granted that you have already seen the movie, and now you are looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) Additional erratic rejection of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie. 2) Additional erratic denial of what you feel was a good movie that needed to defend against such a defamatory scum like myself. Whether you want to articulate your horror or ammunition for an exciting repartee, if I say something good, it will only disappoint you - so let me assure you, there is little chance of such disappointment. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here at IMDb have already summed up the specific shortcomings of the movie (eg the acting, the soundtrack, the direction, the dialogue, the editing, etc.), but all these errors can be readily forgiven, in and of themselves. Few people will rent a movie entitled "Hood of the Living Dead" if they require these elements to be top. However, the ultimate failure of "Hood" is the fact that he does not deliver the abundant promise of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" virtually jumps out of the shelf at the video industry with the implications that it may be one-sided. Here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie film with the realism of life in the ghetto, bombarding the gangsta zombies on the innocent life while rockin shells, too mortal lice in their exhausted rides. The mixture of the two genres could be hilarious. Instead, the movie is more like watching high school children, suddenly delivering the lines on a play they do, but don't understand. To avoid a betrayal of the video hearing, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers release the movie with the next new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: A horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over the weekend last summer because we were bored ". Or maybe they can release it as a documentary version. "The day creativity has died: An exploration of how a low-budget film can still be without sound or original thoughts without being bound to a large film studio." <br /> <br /> The potential tenant whose interest is not troubled should find the following blurb on the back of the video case: "The Quiroz brothers have again proved that things you can do easily yourself not looked very interesting. " Bangla
