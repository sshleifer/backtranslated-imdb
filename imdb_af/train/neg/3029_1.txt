From the first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible series of extremely short tracks of vague camera work. While the overall plot has every potential for excitement, the story is so badly told I can't buy it. From the middle of the film, the actions of characters do not make sense to me. Stop reading to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea that Edna should make them coffee after shooting her son's arm is far below his alleged experience; It's just a very stupid idea. Domino does not question the fragmentary orders she received from Claremont Williams for a break-up connection, but she does not evade me; Shouldn't she be suspicious of Williams longing for them? These FBI agents look out of their minds with just one helicopter on something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shooting. In addition, what they do by giving Cigliutti withholding and leaking information is quite a lot of encouragement to murder; It seems to me as goodbye to the case law as the way the FBI investigates. In fact, they will have a case that is irreparable if they acted like that. We see a car accident that would normally be at least seriously injured if most passengers were not killed, but they all miraculously left with a few bruises. On the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino who loves Choco, who from Domino's point of view is in no way based on past events, but only by stunning the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The whole range of scenes From the phone call from Claremont Williams, I seem like a dramatic razzle blind. Combined with the awful, awkward camera work, it just makes a bit of a scream to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the lead actors, whose talent is undeniable.
