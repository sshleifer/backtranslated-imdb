It's one of those horrible sex-driven B movies that couldn't be played near a theater. Women walk around dressed in thinly dressed "bunny" outfits, an extremely fat woman is the source of many tasteless jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has a strange boy (Jim Hanks, of course Tom's brother, who wants to "get" the man. Hanks is really good, but this movie doesn't go anywhere and has no sense. One has to wonder why it was even made? Nonetheless, because of Hank's performance and some entertaining moments (but not more than a few), it received a star "2" from 10. However, I think I was nice.
