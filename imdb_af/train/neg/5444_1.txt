It was 1974 and Martin Sheen played it. <br /> <br /> It only says what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik reformed, got a good wife and didn't want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik may have been a naive innocent, or he just wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Who was or was Slovik was not for history to decide, but it was a movie that dealt with dessert at a time when a country questioned why it was fighting, and the movie has offices. <br /> <br /> Regardless of soldiers who were also in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's tell the truth, it was about the Vietnam War, not World War II), EoES was like propagandist like Gung Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik made his position clear and simple. He had a nerve problem. Heck, I have a clinical nerve disorder and trust me. If I did military duty, it would have been no problem for me to let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demo or do KP service or latrine service without any problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe the teleflick, Slovik didn't have that option, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> What the viewer also wants to believe is the viewer. I learned that movies of this decade or that decade, in dealing with service or military service, would actually take the same attitude over and over. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s, serve your country. <br /> <br /> It's history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie looks predictable to my Hollywood. He refused to serve and only when he was tied to being executed, he shows emotion. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outburst could easily have worked to its advantage in his statement of his nervous state, but of course the movie wanted to show him as a man and only when he was going to die is he sad. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the judgment of the hail Maria by Ned Beatty and In the end, with the Lord's prayer, it was funny because it sounded like they try to see who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this movie can be watched without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope everything was worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.
