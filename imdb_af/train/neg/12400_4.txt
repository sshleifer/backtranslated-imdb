Matt Cordell is back for the third time, although I'm not sure anyone is being cared for at this point, except for rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last movie, is raised by voodoo and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in shooting a fellow officer whom Cordell loves very much. I missed part of this early 90's low-budget quickie, but it was nice to see Cordell picking up the body in various horrible ways. The problem is, the overall movie is pretty static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. The interest is getting pretty fast, even with those big B-filmmaker Robert Forster as a doctor ending with his brain. Stick to the first movie in the series, which is funny and awesome and exciting at the same time.
