You heard it said that every moment should live as if it were your last? Whether it's your last day or not, I ask you not to waste any part of it! Nichole Hiltz offers some nice moments of candy (which unfortunately remains wrapped up) and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food advertising. A low, unrealistic plot with terrible dialogue means that there is no "art" in the "art of revenge". <br /> <br />
