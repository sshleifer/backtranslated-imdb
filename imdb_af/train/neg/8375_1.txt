America. A land of freedom, of hope and of dreams. It is the nation that has been striving for independence to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world for the sake of all mankind. However, there are times when we cannot help but the Americans will only stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' (and I use the word with a few discussions) calls these feelings with intense cleanliness. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a fiery jewel thief, created by capturing the cut head of Marlon Wayan on the body of a two-foot-tall dwarf. After he accidentally dropped a large diamond in Vanessa's handbag, a reluctant to have children, Calvin realizes that he needs to interfere with the diamond to repair the diamond. So, like any ordinary man, Calvin will dress himself as 2 years old and dress him up on the poor woman's doorstep, where he is discovered by Darryl, Vanessa's brother. <br /> <br /> Darryl is uncomfortable with Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the "baby" has a full set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife scar and the sex drive of a 16- old. Even more absurd, Vanessa also doesn't see Calvin's baby and tries to breastfeed the lesser pervert. This miserable attack on the soul of mankind seeks to find humor in rape, skatology, sexual assault and pedophilia, but in a dishonest attempt to turn into a family entertainment, the Wayan brothers move in a sickly amount. sentiment and lack of morality. <br /> <br /> The brethren dull try a Freudian rehabilitation of their theft rap by revealing that he had a bad dad. By striking Darryl in the cross, Calvin can develop the loving father-son relationship he and Darryl always wanted. As if it were not ridiculous, Calvin's attempts to sexually persuade Vanessa to somehow convince her that it is selfish that a woman should enjoy herself with a successful career. Instead, she should spend her life playing the role of the house-bound grandchild. , spending her time or expressing babies and cooking her husband. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the Wayan brothers blended their scrambled and twisted humor, along with the clumsy sentimentality that many of Hollywood's recent work of work infested. In addition, they are endemic to the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for converting African American humor into a poor and miserable shadow of himself that survives in fiery jokes and coarse sexual gags. By law, these two are legally forbidden to pick up anything that even looks distant from a camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means they have undoubtedly filmed two cheaters this month and will make millions of dollars of sticky merchandise.
