The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and Vienna's history. Take a well-known genius that you haven't read, describe him as dementia, include crazy doctors to heal him, some pretty women, play his part by an actor with a huge mustache, every character speak with the strongest accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another sought-after figure that has nothing to do with the first one (Freud), mention a few words used in the genius's works, redo everything you can , especially music, and you're done. Public, please stay away.
