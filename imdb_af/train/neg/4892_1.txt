they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> OK. First, I doubted that, but after seeing the waking cloud, I changed my mind and was finally convinced that they had sex with watermelons, with people dead or alive. Of course, no safe sex. the (terribly ugly) front man shoots it all in the woman's mouth after he has done the dead woman. Never heard of HIV? don't think. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring but also incredibly rebellious. In fact, in parts it became so disgusting that I couldn't take my virgin eyes. sex with dead people! how big is that? And what is the message behind it all? we need water, we need melons, we need to be dead to have sex? sorry, but it stinks!
