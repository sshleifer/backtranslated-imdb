If I could give it less, I would. Don't bother renting; If someone burns you the DVD, it is burned. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible movie. A total waste of even digital "movie". I have seen better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys. Lommel claims he wrote it. If so, he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story line does not exist, the dialogue is shouted primarily, the camera work is a kind of attempt to arty flairs with nonsensical cuts of completely unrelated leaps to industrial transport scenes or a kind of strange fierce young woman. <br /> <br /> I can usually follow a less obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" movie. I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This one is also beyond my limited comprehension levels I missed. it or it is completely useless. I think it's a "Let's see if we can get a title coming out soon and do a weird gap about it and see if we can grab the money's work. <br /> <br /> I can't see why Lionsgate even bothered it, totally worthless, it's so bad that I wouldn't hire the same director.
