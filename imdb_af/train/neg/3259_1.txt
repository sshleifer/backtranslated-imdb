Fantastic uncomfortable. I don't mean above that just a few people should avoid "Doc Savage". Almost every demographic group will be bored by this trivial, TV movie-quality production. It's a bit like the 60-year-old "Batman" series, except it's not funny. Even by accident. You're better off taking a nap.
