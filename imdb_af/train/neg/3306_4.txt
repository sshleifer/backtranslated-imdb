A very straight cute old lady, desperate to save money to save her home and belongings, becomes a potty in her house, smokes with some old friends and then sells them. This is the story for this low-key comedy, which emphasizes the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor that preaches. For many of the movie it works. The humor is not the laugh-out-loud variety, but it keeps you entertained for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is looking forward to starring. But the end really ruined a "cute" movie with devastating bad messages that would just like to see the ultra-liberals of the film world. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I prefer a happy ending, too, but it shouldn't be all hot and fuzzy for those who violate the law blatantly. Here too, the typical (1) children are out of wedlock, but it does not pose a problem and is considered to be good; (2) clergy who are portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a medical doctor who is also stoned! <br /> <br /> Hello? And reviewers here blast Hollywood? It is Exhibit A how a secular society has lowered the standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least a trace of morality rather than nothing but a Timothy Leary "If it feels good, do it" message.
