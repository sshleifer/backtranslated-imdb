In this strange-unbelieving apocalypse, the world is suffering from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be concerned about this Grade-Z movie that is less like Sheridan Le Fanu's well-known short novel as my mother's lasagna recipe. Bored waiters are still driving petrol stations and doctors are still making home calls and helpful police officers are still getting up with radiator fluid just when you need it. The plot, and I rather use the term, involves a father and a daughter trying to talk to the general, whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who is very comfortable with the father travel and daughter. I must confess that a moment or two of real humor can be found between large pieces of inadvertent humor. The film also boasts just enough nudity to interest a boy of fourteen. Any parent beware.
