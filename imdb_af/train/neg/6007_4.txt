Surprisingly, the film has some redeeming quality in moving it to its end. On the other hand, this movie is a very bad and crippled one, with a small budget, insulting badly written writing and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It is stupid that with all the money in the Christian circles they can never get enough money to make a decent movie. I'm not a religious, so I can't really care less, but movies make some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and to make people more interested and curious to read the Bible, for example. . In this respect, these movies always look like a wasteful opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really makes the movie work and brings it down. This makes the movie laughable with its effects, and it just gives the overall movie a feel-like B movie. <br /> <br /> But what hurts this movie is his writing. The things just happening in this movie are just insulting to the intelligence and then I don't even complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is just as unlikely and the people in this movie are so unlikely to be insulting to their viewers. <br /> <br /> I also hated how the movie was at times like a soap opera. . It seemed to me that they simply made it difficult to make it into a full-length movie, and they added in some characters and dramatic developments to just fill it up. I just couldn't really be rare at times. <br /> <br /> However, it should be said that the film becomes more solid and steady at its end, if its story is more focused on its essence. However, it remains predictable, but it has prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as this type of movie is concerned, there is much worse to look at, although I don't think this movie will be about any new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
