A friend and I rented this movie because it sounded very good. But we were wrong. First of the acting .... wow ... the acting was the worst, the effects were also very bad, it looked like a movie a college child made. The plot was pretty good, but it was done. The thing that destroyed the movies most was the actors. The chief was the worst actor ever ... it is a pity I even call him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad, it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh have seen it .... but other than that ... stay far away from this one. I usually like B-movies and such, but this one ... I don't know how it even managed to be put on video ... this one is the worst I've seen and I've seen badly children.
