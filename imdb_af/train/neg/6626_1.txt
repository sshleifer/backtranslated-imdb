I saw the movie and I screwed because the movie was silly and boring. I thought ram gopal heat would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was spoiled and they spoiled "sholay". the throw and the crew were bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie. Some people ran away in the middle. amitab bachan's play is poor, i thought this movie will be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest flop of the year. No one justified their work, including Ajay devagan. this movie does not deserve audiences. I bet this flop flop. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS"
