This "screwy comedy" looks a lot compelled. Indeed, the actors TRY are very difficult to turn into an essentially unknown script. And as a result, it's not going to be completely over. The idea of ​​a woman who finds out she is pregnant after getting a quick divorce is not just as funny. And then, when Cooper drops down with the baby, because he doesn't want it to be taken up for adoption, it just seems terribly indecent and it really hurts to change it into a comedy. It's also a pity, as the actors were more capable than the script, and I just got bored with the whole mess. Since Cooper has made so many good comedies, I recommend you see them earlier.
