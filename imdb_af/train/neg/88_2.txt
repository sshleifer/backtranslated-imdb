I was looking forward to this movie. It's a good family movie; As Michael Landon Jr. However, the editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another movie from the series, they are all very good. But when another is made, I ask them to look after them better during editing. This story was everywhere in the place and didn't have a center. This is unfortunate because the other films of the series were wonderful. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they are both good role models. In addition, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoys a good love story.
