This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. There were some sub-plots that let you think for a while that these items would eventually come together ... but they didn't. If you want a "stranger in the frozen waste" story, stick to the 1950s version of THE THING (not the horror re-created in 20 years later). <br /> <br /> I couldn't think of the fact that the "alien" is fairly recycled from INDEPENDENCE DAY. <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they hired actors who could actually act as the intended mood. <br /> <br /> Many scenic colds with little discount.
