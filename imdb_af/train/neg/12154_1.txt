You know how everyone is joking about the acting in porn movies? Well, if you've always found the plot line of a porn to enchant your interest, then this movie is for you. It was really like a porn without the sex. Or if the analogy is not to your liking, you and your drunken roommate have found a film camera left on a parquet floor. This is the movie you would make. -Heating work -bath camera work -Music done on a casio keyboard This movie has everything, and more. For those who are masochists in the crowd, it's a premiere piece for your collection. <br /> <br /> All I can figure out is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of film were people standing in it. <br /> <br /> Their movie career is over before it starts.
