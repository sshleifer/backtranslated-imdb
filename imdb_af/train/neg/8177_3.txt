90 minutes from Mindy ... Mindy is a scourge for the boyfriend Bill ... Mindy previews at the high school ... Mindy gates to Big Sur, shops a shepherd's bread, Mindy almost gets gang raped. . Oh, the pleasure of Crown International drives. Keep in mind that these movies are never designed to be watched, starting on DVD players. They were made as 90 minutes of atmosphere, so the teenagers of the 70's would have a soundtrack as they got it in their Pintos and Citations. The lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience - they probably only agreed when the T&A on the screen matched what they were in the parking lot. The film is really annoying when viewed as a story. It's great to talk about it than to see it. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. With no luggage or change of underwear, they spend 2 nights a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and almost raped by depraved cyclists, and after their innocent friend "Pan" was brutally beaten, Mindy and her girlfriend found an unguarded motorcycle on the road. Mindy is immediately raised and torn, "I'm going to Big Sur !!" But again, it's very nice to talk / read about than to go through.
