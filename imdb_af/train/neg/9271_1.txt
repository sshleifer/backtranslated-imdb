For the small minority seen here, this film is praised. I know it's at people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can surely see it's total rubbish. So bad, it's not part of this franchise. I can only assume that is how big it is, are friends with someone involved in the movie and try to give their career a touch. Poor in every way, don't tell people. Storyline is a poor rehash of previous entries, script is likewise. Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not disguise the ideas of the filmmakers, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of alarm clocks. Absolutely no redeeming qualities, totally ungrateful. I awarded these few chancellors one point, simply because they had one to get someone to fund this piece of crap. They had to put more effort than they did to make the movie really. Disgraceful.
