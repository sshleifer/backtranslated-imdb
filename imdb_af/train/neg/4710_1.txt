My brother is in love with this show, let's get it straight. I totally agree with the people who said it was copying Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /> <br /> I've never really had strange parents. I mean, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's really annoying and not cute at all. It's almost the same way I feel about Johnny testing. Besides, nothing makes me laugh at that show. The gags are so stupid and useless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids don't like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is great, but c'Mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab, which used to be one of my favorite programs, and still don't mind watching it. It makes me disgusting and ashamed of Johnny's test, and makes an absolute ghost from that wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. The. Dog. Is. So. Annoying. He's more hard and stupid than Johnny! And the gay accent? What the fudge! I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies because it would be better for children to watch than to listen and watch the unpleasant shit that goes on in that show and pick up a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyeballs to burn in miraculous flames and your brains should be fried from this show, you shouldn't see it!
