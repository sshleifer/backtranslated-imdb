How have I never seen or even heard of this junk movie? It is upright me rose with bloody teen pants, laughing plot and an irresistible 80's cheese atmosphere hanging around there. For some reason, nobody is really interested, the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are being slaughtered by an unknown psychopath. Freshly recruited teacher Julie Parker becomes involved when all the people she contacts are either appearing or acting prominently. This movie is hilariously bathed! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and each character is equally meaningless to the other. For example, a girl died and her body was dumped in a container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly moves three weeks before, but the murdered girl is never called or even missed. Not even by her boyfriend! The acting is a pity and there is not even a little nudity to enjoy. The revelation of the killer is pretty funny because the makers were really convinced it was an original twist. It's not guys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror turkeys ever.
