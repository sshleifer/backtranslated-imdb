In my knowledge Largo winch was a well-known Belgian cartoon (never read) the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without the spy life! So, when I had to choose a movie for a 5 year old child, I picked it up because the kid was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But just after the opening credit, I have serious doubts: when American movies start offering incredible, here, no action and a horrible sex scene? Then the story becomes very complicated with financial moves? I thought I lost the child. <br /> <br /> But strangely, he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was this the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father? The multiple boxing story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? The exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he loves Largo ("Will he get up?") and we enjoyed our moment.
