Although there are quite a few well-known "television" names related to "A Man Called Sledge", nothing extraordinary about the movie itself or any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a television series of the 1960s-70s like the Rat Patrol is a greater role and much more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and presumably thought he should break away from all the light comedy stuff he did ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter" etc). Unfortunately, his earthly fortune works against him, as Sledge is a humorous character written to give cash to the popularity of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western character. But Eastwood's stuff wasn't as flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I suppose "A Man Called Sledge" can be classified as a spaghetti western, although the pace is too slow to really fit that subgenre. Fans of the slow "Combat" series will feel a direct connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw a few, trendy, slow shots and cross-solves, giving attention to themselves, rather than serving a storytelling purpose. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard "big heist" thing (add "War War" here) with Sledge setting up a $ 300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that the truck is being monitored on the road with 40 outriders, while being locked in a safe in the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of Alias ​​Smith and Jones with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The story will make a decent hour of television, but grow old very quickly as a very full feature film. Garner does not allow any of his charms to leak into his characterization and the film does not create enough tension to hold a viewer's interest. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the thing collapses and burns shortly after the gang has used. a complicated and completely illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
