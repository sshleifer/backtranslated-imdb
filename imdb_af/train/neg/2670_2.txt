There is no way you care about any of these characters. Some spoiled middle-class overgrown children take drugs at a party and go down with each other and argue. I just saw it on TV and I didn't think it's a 'movie' as such, more a post-'This Life 'concession that really has no resonance or proper drama on it. Such things will be commanded by the ominous unhappy, irrelevant middle-class "lifestyle" shit that takes itself too seriously. It has David Baddiel in it and the bird from "Cold Feet", you know what to expect. There were a lot of these things in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise ... "they were educated and used drugs? Friends, but kind of dysfunctional and with turbulent relationships? Sounds good!". This kind of nonsense, and after-Guy Ritchie comedy gangster stuff ... dark days. If you taste it will irritate you to the point of violence.
