I can only assume that the other judges of these "movie" shareholders are in the production company, as it's probably the worst movie I've seen in the past five years. From the opening shot of a Rabbi who laughed uncontrollably, it was clear that the actors in this movie would kill to be considered "B-level". Both my wife and I were in a good mood before the start of this movie, and we were really looking forward to a funny popcorn movie. We knew we didn't rent Citizen Kane, and we didn't expect to see the most amazing movie ever. But after 40 minutes to endure the most painstaking, unhindered piece of garbage I've ever seen, we ended it instead of wasting another few minutes of our lives. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" with no laughter, terrible acting, thin plot and annoying characters is your thing, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the popcorn scene. <br /> <br /> I can't justify writing a longer review of this photo, as I have been scarcely having an hour to find one joke.
