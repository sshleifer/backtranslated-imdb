I saw this recent Woody Allen movie, because I'm a fan of his work and I make it a point to try to see everything he does. Although the reviews of this movie have resulted in a disappointing effort. They were right. It's a confused movie that can't decide whether it's a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about female middle crisis. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has faithfully married and leads a life of aimless luxury with her boring husband and their two young children. This rather mundane plot concept is complemented by such incompetence as an ancient Chinese folk doctor who makes her invisible with some magical herbs and the ghost of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic to you, how about something more prosaic, like a relationship with a saxophone player? <br /> <br /> I was never quite sure what this mixed muddle was trying to say. There is only a handful of really funny moments in the film, and the end is a special touch of Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> Renting 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead, a wonderfully well-made film emerging in the combination of comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
