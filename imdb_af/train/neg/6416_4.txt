SOME NON-SO-SPOILY SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> Why, when disoriented or sick or scared at a club, do they cut through the middle of the busy dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks in their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger's door and when they don't answer IMMEDIATELY, open the door, step in, scream a few hello and then start going through their stuff? <br /> <br /> If you're pursued by someone you just discovered, was a killer, what would you do? Quiet quietly and hide it under a wooden platform or under metal tools? Of course, run to a rotty old barn or other rounded structure? <br /> <br /> I can talk about almost any excitement that has come out over the past few years, but since it's the "Return" page, I speak of "The Return." I saw it for free because I work at a cinema and make a point of exploring all the "scary" movies. I thought this was tolerant ... apart from the well-behaved clich√©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really dead and looks kind of "Huh?" by most of the movie. The details of the plot are slowly released as the film progresses and it is almost enough to make it interesting, except that there was not enough explanation as it moved on and so I was almost lost to the last 2/3 of it. <Br /> <br /> If you're a hard-thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there is nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie, I think it's worth a matinee ticket. If you thought the trailer would look like an interesting movie and you can't wait ... wait.
