I went to see the Omega code with a group of other Christians covering about 15 people. We all expected to make a good piece of Christian movies. What we got was an extremely painful, protracted, and pretty boring movie. It has good production values, but also has poor acting, poor writing with poor dialogue, and no right direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated, and some people in our group placed this movie as a bigger cheese than 'Anaconda'. None of us could believe the movie lasted less than 2 hours. Flashing effects and sharp cinematography cannot save this bad, bad movie. I give it a 3 out of 10, and the score is just as high because I saw the horrible "movie" Werewolf (1996) the night before I saw this movie.
