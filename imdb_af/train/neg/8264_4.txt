It's a movie where the actors are all right, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie where each of the three couples meets in a situation that feels enriched, forced to be cute or to move the story set. In other words, it feels like they are colored movies, not like real life. Even if women who work at socializing venues ever go with one of their clients, it just doesn't seem realistic as it is written in this movie. When one of the characters also meets the overweight woman in the movie, it feels artificial, the way they look after each other in seconds. Again, the actors are all good, and moments from this movie are nice, but overall another indie that could have used some rewriting before the production began to roll.
