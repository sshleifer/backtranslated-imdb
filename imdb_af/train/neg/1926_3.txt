After having forced my children to see it at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christian cases, I feel adequately qualified to judge this version of dr. Seuss's classic story, well ... it's not very good. First, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV species, it will be difficult for everyone, but this interpretation is so melancholy and filled to be positive. I will admit that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall, the film comes out as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it presupposes Christmas commercialization. Jim Carrey is typical above, but it is totally inconsistent with Grinch's character. As characterized by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and clever. There is no way to use Carrey's madness, and that's just the most obvious mistake. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are being wasted completely. Why, universally, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will just take on any role being offered (much like his compatriot Michael Caine), but this must be submitted under "Movies That Should Never Be Made." It doesn't promise good for the Cat in the Hat, a thinner thumbs that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will make the same recommendation for one as I am with this one: Save it and read or read the book or watch the TV. It is 2 hours you can never return.
