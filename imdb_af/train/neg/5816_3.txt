Out of the critical praise, I expected more from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just ran out and didn't have a point or a plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (adult for her age or no) would be so blown away to get the loss of her virginity. Maybe I'm too young to tell (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no problems with the stories of Shakespeare in Love, or life is beautiful and I wasn't alive for one of those institutions. The role play is very good, but unfortunately for them the writing did not allow them to engage the audience. Overall, Slums had his moments, but if you don't want to remind about dumbbells and tube socks, I'd say this one.
