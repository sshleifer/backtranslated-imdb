Although I have to admit, I laughed more at watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget must consist of business change of actors. The production values ​​are so low that they really made it look good. Remind me of the Robot Monster which consists of a man in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a victimless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I wondered why the victim didn't start shouting "None Will Pass" and "It's just a flesh wound, I got worse." This was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year. <br /> <br /> The "gladiator / demon" was also a sting. Between the terribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it, the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> A movie that's bad enough to see. Similar to seeing a slow car crash on film. <br /> <br />
