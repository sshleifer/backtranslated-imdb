This is one of the worst things ever to come from England, so it says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out if Lembach stays or not is incredible. The front secretary, Sheila, looks in her picnic table for a while after dr. Rat Face Trapped. This movie also has several views of London, though none of them are good. There is also a point where there is almost a car accident that gets your heart rate just below normal. There is also a teleported watch, and the fear that the woman does not look back is parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense", just a much more dull and British. Add on a raging rifle between the British police and the Dr Rat, which has nothing to do with the electricity of many people, plus a cat and you have yourself ... ummm ... a British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good, though not one of the best.
