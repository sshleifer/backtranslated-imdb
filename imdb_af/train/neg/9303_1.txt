I am writing this review after watching it a few months ago .... the trailer looks promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. It's a complete joke .... and literally a spit in the face of the right classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which they even had the gall to put themselves on the back of the compare cover art. The producer who played Brandon should throw tasty hamburgers and serve fatty hamburgers. He may not even be good! The lighting was bad and a great annoyance from the movie you couldn't even see the actor's faces. I don't even remember the rest of the members who are sad, bad, they do nothing to impress you to make them unforgettable. It's all the time I will waste on this review. PLEASE BE FAR as far as you can from this hope junk, even if you get it for 25 cents, don't buy it. Buy a piece of gum. It will entertain you! <br /> <br /> If you want a good quality low budget school, much better than that ... look at a Jeff Hayes movie .... because it takes talent to make it horrific and the child has it! <br /> <br /> I just gave this one star for the cover art .... that's the only thing worth meeting this so-called "movie". <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
