I watched this movie. To the end. And it wasn't really easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost every detail stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT", which you can't believe the makers take it seriously. Even harder to believe is how this "product" made it to VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to watch a horror movie, just watch "Scream" but if you want to laugh hard and enjoy a good time, look at some kids running through the forest and after shout and show how inability they are, look dark.
