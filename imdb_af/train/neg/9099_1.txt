This review also features a spoiler of the first movie - so if you haven't seen a movie and want to, but don't want the spoilers, please don't read the review! <br /> <br /> While this movie is supposed to be about the Christian and Kathryn event for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions. The actors they portrayed Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are indeed very poor substitutes. Also, the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did could not deduce. It is absolutely terrible that some of the dialogue was verbal - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen enough now, you will recognize it. There are also contradictions in the plot. If it really was the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why did Christians fall in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He is supposed to be in love with the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character) for the first time. <br /> <br /> Also joining with photography / "You can be a model" comment at The end was completely paralyzed and didn't add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can't believe they have made a cruel intention 3.
