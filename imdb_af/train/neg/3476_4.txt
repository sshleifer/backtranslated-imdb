I liked it, I really did. Please don't think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a crap, it was crazy, but sometimes it's fun to relax and watch a crappy movie you don't have to concentrate too much on. I didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales, and there wasn't any, but it didn't matter, because I just watched it for entertainment, and it entertained me all the time. Movies like this are why the Ben Stillers (excuse "there's something about Maria") and Vince Vaughns (how you also played his name, I couldn't bother) worked. It's right to watch a crap movie as long as you don't expect too much, and I'll stand for one, run, maybe run, but don't drive because I don't have a car, Blockbuster Video, or even choices, and rent a bunch of these toilet humor movies and stay in one night watching them. Good day for your reader. P.s if you don't say these comments helped you, then I don't like you, if you say it helped, then God will bless you, you will go to heaven.
