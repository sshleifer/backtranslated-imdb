I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, more objective photo and more consistency. It's just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romance, it's just boredom itself. I find the actors' work also quite poor. O'Donnell may look great like Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he doesn't lack any charm. Probably, as he grows older, he loses his childish charm, but does not get an adult's charm. It is no surprise that it is not shown in many countries and is sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and is not even released in the Netherlands.
