This movie is probably pro-Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character is a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian town. At the end of the film, he seems to be a Muslim because of his main character, that he kept his amulet and his general clothes. He has a six-year-old child who carries the same body and therefore it is probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. The main character therefore chooses to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. Neither of the other male main characters, who are Christians, seem to break out of a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end, so it seems.
