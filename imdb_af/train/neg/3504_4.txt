I got this show (I just watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes / actions seem to fail. Some are not funny, but some are amusing - in a 12-year-old boy. She reminds me of the New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what she has, including the kitchen sink, while praying that a few things stick to the wall in her attempt to be funny but different. <br /> <br /> But what she often got was not enough, as if she didn't have the kind of succession, a good comedian should succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole business is like an under-potato.
