I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit, it wasn't my cup of tea. Although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But when I watched it, I thought. "This movie doesn't make sense at all." Where on earth did this man come from in the dark dress? Where were the two guys when they left the girls? Where on earth did a shark come out? <br /> <br /> All these elements in this movie have somehow not been added. I felt like these movie makers wasted so much time and money on such a movie. So much I've seen very good horror movies in my time, but it's one of the worst horrors I've seen. At the end of the movie, I told myself I wouldn't look at it again. So much pappy show in this movie, I decided to give it the thumbs! Count me on this one! 0 out of 10!
