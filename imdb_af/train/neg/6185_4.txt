My first review of 2010 is "In The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who want to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploration, they were approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artefact about Columbus's hidden treasure reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> Next day, the four divers go to the bottom of the reef and dive nothing from rough to a full day. A few days past and the two hired divers found out that they are part of a huge deadly plot in which they cannot escape. They will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a nucleus. <br /> <br /> The movie also features a story about another person (brother of the main character) trying to upload things to his girlfriend. I think this part of the story was a waste of time, it also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple who is a complete waste for me and was not needed to show. <br /> <br /> But apart from that movie does have good underwater photography and the colors blend well and therefore it gets 4 stars. In blue 2, a successor is only by name. None of the original actors or characters come back, it has a stupid plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
