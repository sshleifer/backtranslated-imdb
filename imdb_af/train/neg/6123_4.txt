When I was a teenager for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and her various statements about this film. But now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is terrible. Please note, Bo Derek is absolutely amazing, and she and husband John Derek make sure you see a lot of her. But if you take that aspect out of the movie, it becomes one big, dull ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane for the first time (that is Bo of course) he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo wears a wet see-through shirt, with her chest showing prominently. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to hit a beautiful naked body, then it can fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and valuable movie, go elsewhere ... almost nowhere else !!!
