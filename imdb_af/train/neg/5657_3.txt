I'm a big fan of Lon Chaney, but the screenplay of this movie didn't work for me. The story jumps alien (I've learned since then that the movie is missing a part), and characters appear and disappear with annoying suddenness. Some of the subtitles are excessively explanatory (eg "Why are you no longer a child!" - cut back to the photo for a long, slow beating - "you're a woman!" Yes, we got it first time, but there are some talk series that ask for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blonde girl's argument, please!) The plot, which involves turbulent desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was difficult to watch. For the author's credit, this problem was considered a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right and inevitable inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (eg "Daddy-Long Legs"). Chaney usually gives a good performance, but I think he's better geared up in the past - he told it several times here, IMHO. I enjoyed the clone order and was very impressed with the stunts. Loretta Young was beautiful, but surprisingly young. The movie has its moments, but so far it's my least favorite Chaney picture.
