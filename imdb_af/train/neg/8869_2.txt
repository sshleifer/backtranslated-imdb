With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry really hit the bottom of the rock. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has had a peaceful life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund) in recent years. One day Stefan's old friend arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan is a small courier work. He is supposed to bring a suitcase full of heroine through Sweden-Germany customs. Unfortunately things don't work in Germany as planned and Stefan is now in great trouble. It's always nice to see a Swedish movie breaking the traditional family drama pattern. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how a movie should be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight in the movie is the unproven sex scene of the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. It only takes a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes pure. Let's say what it really is, crap.
