I tried as hard as putting the whole way through this annoying mess, but I just couldn't do it. Brad Dourif sucked absolutely the lead role and all the supporting role players were only slightly worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is just ridiculous, from the terrible actions of the ridiculous FX to the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Full waste of time; Don't bother. Root canal therapy will be more enjoyable. Bamboo sleeves under the fingernails will be much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watching Your Boll movie will only be a little worse than that. Get the idea?
