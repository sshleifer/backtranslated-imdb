That's what my friend Brian said about an hour about this movie. He was unable to keep off. I was terrified of how invaluable it was and eventually I got up and played, running out of adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want, the pinnacle of hacking. Something so uninspired, so impossibly terrible, that everything you want to do after watching it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie is viewable. It is not, not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would only recommend it to anyone to help them understand how truly unbearable it is. Don't believe me? Come around. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, as a nation, we do not always make the Middle Eastern people taste good in America. But how about a child in a sock outfit that bends in a salami fashion to a stack of Castrol motor oil bottles? You will find it here. GET THIS? THE ARAB WORSHIPS OIL. I couldn't believe what I saw. Having the kid planes in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think it was a funny joke? It's not even close to "smart offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to punch paid to write that little bit in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, a five-man singing group called "Landmines" is the stage at an official ball. All right, are you right? The joke is their kiss and off-key. Why did I write it in caps too? Because the joke is POUND, POND, pointed in your head with a HORRENDOUS sight gags marathon. They start mediocre enough; glasses cracking, punch tumblers crushing ... then there, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence of a woman's shoes comes off. You read it correctly - the music was so bad, in one frame, the woman's feet were wearing shoes. The next time the shoes are off! Get it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came down! What the f ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless assembly of inventory to bring home the point that the SINGING BAD IS. If one is actually suffered by this scene in the theater without running like hell, I will be surprised. This movie is frankly like a practical joke to see how quickly people will turn off the doors. Robert Downey Sr. gives rise to the comedy as his son addresses respect by staying drug-free. Bad. Other things to note: <br /> <br /> 1. The popular music shoe horn in where possible. Every time Licentier appears, play a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song. Plus, all the actors are doing their best to act because for some reason it has become very cold. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's criminal terrible accent. She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while she rolls a marble around her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys are all shouting at her fuss as they are in a community school acting class and they are geared up to act like excited delayed people. <br /> <br /> 3. Licensee is feeding his rebellious dog a condom. Remember, when this movie came out, he threw in "abortion" and "condom" as "edgy". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston played a grinding, son-hungry pedophile, back when Hollywood thought "pedophile" and "gay" were one in the same. Challenging embarrassment. <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the end. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. This is actually the end. Tell me it doesn't mean you want to explode everyone who ever made a movie. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. Up The Academy knew that other movies, like The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, were actually less funny simply by placing the video tape near them.
