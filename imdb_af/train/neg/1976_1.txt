How is it possible that a movie can be badly made. Bad acting. Bad writing. Just an embarrassment around. This is just one bad clich√© to another. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some big names in it. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This movie made little money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies is just not there. It's a pity they didn't have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some big names in it.
