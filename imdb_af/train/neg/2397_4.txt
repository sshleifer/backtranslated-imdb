Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller. DON`T LOOK NOW, didn't he? Strangely, the aforementioned film was broadcast on BBC television over the weekend which had no favors tonight's performance of COLD HEMEL. <br /> <br /> You see it is impossible not to compare COLD SKY with DON`N COOK NOW as they both have the same director and same structure and for the first third of COLD SKY I thought they also had Replacing the same plot except a dead man instead of a dead child, in fact, my thoughts were on this movie about a sad widow who saw her late husband walking to carry Venice with a red anorak. It does not occur, but about a third of the road through time is a massive plot and, despite being essential, it is not explained in any depth. In fact, very little is explained in COOLHEMEL, which destroys the film <br /> <br /> People mentioned the rather poor production values ​​of Cold Sky and it is impossible not to notice them. If I wasn't different, I would have thought it was a TVM, as it made a television to get it right to white capitals in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to inject art house predictions via spoken thought processes, but it doesn't help the movie at all. One cannot help feeling. Roeg must put all his efforts into the plot turns that are completely flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, interested directing and a very bizarre performance and screenplay make for a bad movie
