I borrowed this movie from the library, thinking it might be great. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a pretty girl but in this movie she is not at all seductive, but I will have to prove her uncomfortable attempt to deceive almost all the other main characters. It's so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the film's dialogue is so pretentious and the lack of humorous fact that is then acceptable. <br /> <br /> Overall failure.
