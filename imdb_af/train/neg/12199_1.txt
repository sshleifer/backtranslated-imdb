-My and my sister watched that movie now. We laughed to the deaf. can you imagine on the deck there nomination for Oscar ?? - first the musician mixes about 4-5 different music styles ... and the music is not synchronized with the screens and moves the character ... <br /> <br /> --- main character Silvester does not fit in there. He looks like Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are all but Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. plane called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What is an idea when Rambo is jumping off the plane but he is stuck? rope mix 3. a girl? The best scene is when she dies. She means a lot to him. He knew her for centuries? he cries for her ... o my god samurai 4. how many darts does he have? his dart is always full of arrows? I didn't see a scene where he was collecting them - but I saw the scene where the arrow stays in the Vietnam solder head - that's very important. 5. How many rockets can the helicopter hold? (real one) I saw 4. but Rambos hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. The most important part. What the Russian special military helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. First scene when he enters into Vietnam's camp ... his first idea was to free the refuge that stands on the tree on the open space, wow, which is an idea again: 1. with the knife you cut the iron wire? Maybe just made in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - use to hit a running man? o my god, your Americans really need to learn about the weapons! do you know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think the author watched too many movies after World War II)
