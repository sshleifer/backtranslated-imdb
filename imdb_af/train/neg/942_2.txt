See it on the cable late one night. When I didn't know that the girl who was announced as Shannon Wilsey was actually pornstar Savannah, she was so beautiful (and so often got naked, thank you that I actually sat through this brain-rotting float. I like cheese-like flakes so much like the next man - more than the next guy, actually - but it was far more than cheesy and more rancid. The bad scientist and director, writers and special effects of people's virtually total incompetence contradict the gracious nudity that the The only saving grace of the movie is Savannah, before turning into the plasticized Barbie Doll, becoming her a porn queen, is really interesting to look at - she is deadly, beautiful, bursting, sometimes uncontrollable, giggling, shining and laughs and usually looks like a very good time, which is more than can be said for the audience, because although Savannah and her colleagues naked a fair amount of this photo, it still doesn't spend d ie the fact that it is an incredibly stupid, fussy and annoying film. If you know someone who has it on the video, or if it's a night on the cable, make sure you don't waste it on the rent.
