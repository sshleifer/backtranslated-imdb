It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise a movie for an aspect of its production, but the intense annoying behavior of more than half the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the deduction was that the block designed by the building had failed a flood. Is ok. <br /> <br /> Also, trying to shoot out a deluge-slalom style won't work. Running 10 feet in some trees won't work. Oh, it does. As mentioned before, the intricate stupidity and mere stupidity of some characters are ridiculous. In a confined space, with limited oxygen, a four-year-old can tell you that a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes from the movie, the value of the movie is being released. However, if you have some kind of intelligence, you will also find it difficult to endure most of this movie. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that so many quality stories aren't produced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made. <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned the last five minutes? Well, to give yourself a hook, keep looking to see the latest in fighting avalanche techniques. Absolutely priceless.
