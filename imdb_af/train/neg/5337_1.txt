There are so many negative reviews about "Stay away, Joe" here I can no longer keep quiet and let this injustice happen. Here's a side you haven't heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's movies are my shame for a simple reason: these are perfect movies for a pure relaxation, because I don't have to think when I see it. That means I don't have to worry about a complex plot, because there's never a proper plot to start with. I can only kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, turn off my brain, and enjoy all the wackiness and horrible, easy-going rock-roll songs of the roughest decade of them all. <br /> <br /> In my books, "Stay away, Joe" definitely falls into the "so bad thing" category. Now if you are like me and appreciate "the trash value", this is the ultimate campus experience of 1960. It's so bad it's almost surreal to look at and just when you think it can't get worse, it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. Ultimately, you are so surprised at all the new levels of stupidity that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so damn amusing that once a generation was making movies like this. I still give it 1 out of 10 - once it hits the bottom 100, it becomes an immediate bad movie classic.
