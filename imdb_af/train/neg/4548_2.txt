Boring. Minimal plot. No character development. I went out of the book in this movie with high expectations. It could have been a wonderful movie. It may have become a cult classic. No, it was a huge deviation. It was poorly cast and had terrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were: the rebels or the army or the church or all of them? I'm still surprised by some mini-pots from the movie. I am amazed at some aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never fully explained. I felt like I was watching a cricket episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It looked very much like a TV movie. Don't see this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
