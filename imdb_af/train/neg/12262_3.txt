Adult movie fans have endured many terrible movies over the past few days. Blood Surf shamelessly closes the list of stupid, excess pulp-horror titles on ridiculously large animals that want to change the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we had to fight through the mutilated 'Crocodile' (led by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other movies and ?? top of it ?? it likes to exaggerate. The saltwater crocodile is thought to be 90 years old, over 30 feet long (!) And it makes fun! During the film, he entertaines himself by devouring a whole bunch of stupid surfer dudes and dudettes who experience new excitement by navigating in a shark-overloaded area. The only beautiful aspect of this movie is its tropical location. Although this is a completely inappropriate setting for a movie like this, the lagoons and nature look great. Every other aspect is just disastrous. There is quite a bit of gore, but everything looks fake and laugh. The dialogues are quite painful to listen to! You won't believe the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope they are not so stupid for them! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as a "mechanical toy," but the crocus looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's big white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacre fails to impress. I won't say too much about the play, as it is so secondary in flash. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs jump joyfully as they run away from the animal. You guessed it: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. It gets so nice again. But 'funny' for a completely different reason than James Hickox meant.
