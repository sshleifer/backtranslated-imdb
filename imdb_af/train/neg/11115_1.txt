One previous reviewer called this film 'pure visual joy'. I wonder if he saw the same movie I did. "High Art" has had the most relentless depressing interiors since the "Seven". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the clich√© to go to a B&B for their first time. Of course, before doing so, one must occupy opium-denied parties inhabited by people who are not seemingly profitable but somehow support a thriving drug habit. Not to mention the icy stars of the famous films, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start, they are aware that they will be thrown over some time over the next 100 minutes. The film also says the Sheedy character has retired for ten years of professional photography. What did she do, retire at age twenty?
