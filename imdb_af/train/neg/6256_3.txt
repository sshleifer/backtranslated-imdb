Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer who said "strange people with generous taste reviewed this movie". I thought the movie was intriguing enough to see it. I think it was mainly because of Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is psychologically psychologically appealing and on the one hand deeply homophobic. Thumb on the former and triple thumb on the latter. I'm not sure if the film is meant to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was mediocre. Many conversations that were about 90 degrees did not expect anything from reality. I still wanted to derive a sense of the plot, but it was only a conversation with a madman (Speedman). I feel generously sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. His loss is no greater and is certainly less than the losses incurred by more important causes every day of the world. <br /> <br /> Does the film naive about HIV / AIDS? Yes: That of the intended audience. Is HIV a Dark, Mysterious, Evil Killer? What about the victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less malicious intent than lupus, multiple sclerosis, TB, hepatitis, CANCER, or their victims, for GODS. Just because a disease is transferable does not make it a deliberate or negligent - or evil - it is. <br /> <br /> Is this excuse for ignorance or foolish risks? - NO. Should all people practice safe sex? - YES. Will safe sex save the world? - NO. Are safe sex realistic in all cases of love and lust between passionate and emotional people? ?? NOT NATURAL. What kind of a world would we live if everyone followed the rules, no one ever had any risks and sex was never spontaneous and passionate ??? I ignore the movie dealing specifically with gay sex? ?? YES. HIV is spread by sharing blood or body fluids between infected and non-infected individuals. Sex is not required for transfer, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by intentional violence by one person on another. I actually thought the movie did a good job of portraying the absurdity of Tom's violent abduction, imprisonment and intention towards Dan. This kind of bad violence occurs every day. <br /> <br /> Stream of conscious notes from The movie: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why don't Dan ask why, do you feel so, rather than what do you do? Implication: men who have sex with men get 'AIDS' Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in the sex act? Why was it Dan's responsibility to use the condom? "Maybe you slipped it before you stuck it?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she didn't want to hear the truth." Make a joke. "She's in heaven and so incredibly hurt about what she knows about me now." Is Dan's life over if he has HIV? Certainly not! Is that why the whole world is so homophobic ???? They think gay men are the cause of HIV, that they will give it to the rest of the world, and we will all die? do you joke ??? Are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem ??? So do we feel about the victims of tuberculosis? of malaria? I can see that Tom was hurt because of his wife's death, and he blames it for Aids, but seriously ?? who is here guilty? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the sick? (assuming they didn't search and didn't try to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Sure, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but it's not driving, not flying, leaving home, non-living. Do we want to blame the disease on the victims? Would safe sex between Tom and Dan prevent Tom's wife's ultimate downfall? Maybe, but not Dan's own responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. I called it. <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve" ?? COME ON! 24 days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I overreacting? Maybe. But I think this film shows a judging finger to gay men for their reckless and malicious intent to create a "straight world" by practicing unsafe sex, as the rate of homosexuals who practice safe sex is even or better than that of heterosexuals. We all need to wake up and get serious about HIV / Aids. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of just Africans every year.
