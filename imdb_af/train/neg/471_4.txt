A cute "misfits-in-the-army" saga, trying half-heartedly to be both surreal (the foreign subtitles) and vulgar (the flatulence), but ending a mixture of many different kinds of humor, none of them followed very successfully. Barbara Bach, the Bond Girl of "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
