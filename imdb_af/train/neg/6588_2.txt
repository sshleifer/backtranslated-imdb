The following are some of the most frightening issues with this movie: 1) Clich√©s are abundant. Serious, terrible "turning" is everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps in time, which will be good if done well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame characters that do not evolve so much or remain altogether static or drastically change for no good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big one: HORRIBEL. Over the top of almost every person. <br /> <br /> The following are some of the best points of the movie: 1) The lead is damn but beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people who will be in this movie: a) People who can sit 90 minutes of the ride just because the head is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think of themselves, I like Hollywood dreck-rich with cliches and overacting, but if I could only see it in Korea ... "There is a very good Korean movie theater out there, so why do you waste your time with garbage?
