What a waste! This movie really could have been something decent, but writing is especially crazy, and the main characters are fairly level and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recreation of the seventies was well-crafted, but overall this movie was a great waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, which deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the big BOOGIE NIGHT.
