This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story,' theater release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the foniest, uninspired and most boring biographical documentaries I've seen. If the movie I saw in a kiosk was originally released on TV, I would argue with its producers and distributors not to deceive a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematic worthy documentary feature. Even as a TV documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying entertainers sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms, and the pompous, pseudo-literary narrative more true of a sleepy Infomercial bed. The only redeeming aspects of this "The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, was "The Untold Story of Princess Diana", the original concert, video and TV recording - inexorable Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimony interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses with insights, such as: "He was a free spirit" (really. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) lowered the Freddy testimonials, by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe who new and loving light in Mercury's complex life and character. And ... how about the Harry Potter-like hostel schools? How did the interview with the first girl-lover ("now working in a travel agency") and members of Freddy's first school group contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, queen, remain unbeaten. These filmmakers do not ask a single challenging question, nor do they do independent or visionary research on their subject, but provide a boring montage of polite clean and extremely empty remarks about a mysterious and brilliant rock legend that does not deserve. To be remembered by this history channel biography, your grandparents can relax on a Sunday night.
