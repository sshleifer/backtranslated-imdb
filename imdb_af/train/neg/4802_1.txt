I give this marriage 3 years and that's it. Adrianne Curry is dirty mouth, spoiled, controlled, loud, and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris he has an image to protect and should avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has a low self-esteem and a different time change. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will not have a happy offspring. Her mother said he was an old cock and thought it was his last attempt to regain his youth. Here are two very good people who will end up in a nasty divorce. I don't think his old "Brady Family" will fit into his new life. I see they are excluded. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He supported him and was there for him.
