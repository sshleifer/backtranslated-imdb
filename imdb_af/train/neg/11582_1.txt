I'm glad to see most other people here, don't even think much about this movie. It has some big names in the cast, but it is. There is nothing else to recommend, except to save some pretty women you can do in a thousand movies. <br /> <br /> The story involves nothing but unlikely, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that national film critics all look like .... and most of the public can't stand. <br /> <br /> The Oklahoma accent is so fake, they are laughing, the southern racist stereotypes are right of Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressed.
