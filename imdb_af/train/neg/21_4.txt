What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It actually required me to buy this movie to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film was another failure for him. The writing was so bad. They were just nothing to sink your teeth and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the writing and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the gunfire at the beginning of the movie sounded like the noise of paintball guns when fired in a screen. It was very weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this movie. There was also a very annoying block at the start of the film that was a member of the robbery. He has this American fairy tale like a girl shouting lines like: "Let's get the F # $ k from here" and what will our husband do. "He sounded like a girl. As a positive. It was funny to watch and made it. I also laugh for a few seconds. Woo Hoo! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He'll bounce back ...
