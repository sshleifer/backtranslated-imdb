By the end of the movie I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom and watched our Navy act, save by the sea. I liked seeing the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I had figured it out before, but I never thought about it. The use of a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is strange and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, as it is mostly seasoned professionals, but if you go so far from what is likely to happen, it should be more than a fantasy, comic, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie is filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it hurts the quality of a movie when a serious topic is made in a caricature. That's why I said it had to be more comical. My pet flight with movies about air travel is that everyone is just passing by. They walk around with drinks, put them down and count them 5 minutes later, just as if they were in a building or something, and act as if turbulence just didn't exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but stress doesn't have to include a 30-second accident after he hit something. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses kept this poor manuscript of a movie canned after the first show. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see a psychotic person ... :)
