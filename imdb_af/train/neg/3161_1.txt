Much of the "over her body" is so painful that I actually embarrass the actors in my seat. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves she can't carry a movie in this terrible romantic comedy, and beyond, that she doesn't really even have a comic timing. She is noisy and annoying as a ghost coming back to earth to hold a cookie pie to meet her widowed fianc√©. The fiancee is played by Paul Rudd, dripping and charmer, while the psychologist is played by Lake Bell, which makes the film any anemic energy it has. I was most sorry for Bell, as she apparently had comic skills and worked overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately, she is against the insurmountable task of making a movie that Jason Biggs tolerates. She is dragged along with the rest of the role as Leo DiCaprio at the end of Titanic. <br /> <br /> "About Her Dead Body" actually ruined me because of his laziness and total lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can't be funded, because huge amounts of money are getting so thin. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies are so good enough? How stupid do they really think is the movie audience? <br /> <br /> Degree: F
