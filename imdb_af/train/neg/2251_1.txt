Actually a wonderful hope of porridge! <br /> <br /> A predictable, slow-moving, soul-destructive, ingenious movie that lets you cut your own wrists with a rusty bread knife ... seems almost necessary. <br /> <br /> The acting is over for the thin dialogue, every scene is at least twice as long as it should be, the intricate details of how this career collapses or the career is rising is just too cruel and mundane for words. The music will be great if you don't have to sit down by the movie, but really, three good songs aren't enough reward for the effort needed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie I prayed to pray. God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, ever, ever again.
