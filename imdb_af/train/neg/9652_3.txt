The second half is getting better with the turn in the story of Ajay that destroys Salman, but unfortunately the climax falls and the movie ends on a bad note. <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is ordinary below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocre. <br /> <br /> Among actors, Ajay gives his best shot though he is not convincing as a Rock singer, but he is excellent as the negative role Salman Irritate with his punjabi and speaks nonsense only when he impresses get drunk and on it.
