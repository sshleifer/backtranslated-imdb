Jeez, just in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this peculiar hybrid of spaghetti western and kungfu movie that develops around a treasure hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian once-off company include humorous storytelling, out-of-the-wall events and some very easy T&A. Extra-campive moments are served by Lee Van Cleef's unpleasant wig, leather-clad, bible-dipping psycho manager Yancey Hobbitt (lovingly accumulated by Julian Ugarte, the man who had to do more dark European genre productions than he did) humorous dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laced sound effects that accompany several small events (especially every jump made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While this little piece of action falls and squares in the Turkey Territory, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can't deny the charisma of this duo. Don't expect too much, and you'll get enough of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
