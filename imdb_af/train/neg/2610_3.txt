102 DALMATIANSE [Walt Disney]: I wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a stupid, stuffy story, terribly over that acted by Glenn Close, which deter every scene as if she play for her own entertainment, and incredibly boring and uninteresting key players. The dogs are again the only "actors" that actually look and it's a stretch. Another waste here. GRADE: D
