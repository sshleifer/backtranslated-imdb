You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. A juicy, thin verse and it will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine who comes from his retirement to let us know he is not dead as we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul who married Ethel Merman a few years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this movie, Ernie jumps first in feet and portrays the grandfather who makes ties with his long lost grandchild. We've seen it before. You may enjoy this movie, but don't say you're not warned.
