I wanted to keep this movie and watch it completely by thinking it should get better. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie ever, but it never lives up to its potential. The point is good, the throw is good (I'm especially pumped to see the return of David Naughton) and, God loves them, you can say everyone tried their best. It only briefly touches on. "Brutal massacre" should serve as a constant reminder of filmmakers, that only Christopher Guest can do Christopher Guest movies and, despite the fact that he makes it look easy, you should just forget to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often ... they are the reason why it gets 4 stars from me. If you have the "Spinal Tap" of horror, I suspect you might want the man who made "Spinal Tap" to stir it ... just think out loud there.
