The film did it: show how a young girl is dealing with poverty and growing in her maturity. However, for most of us, this topic has been adequately investigated and, in most cases, more sophisticated than here. The movie got fit, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If it was on TV, I would have switched to the latest news on the Starr report. It's so boring, I got this movie.
