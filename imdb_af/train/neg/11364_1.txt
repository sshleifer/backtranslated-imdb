The first 10 minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium is good: you see real chaos on the set, a producer on the side of a nervous breakdown, the cool is director (Mickey Rourke) , the bad tempered star, etc. You've seen everything before, but it's done well. BUT THERE! The rest of the time the movie just repeated: the same ten minutes over and over. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f ** ked career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. A total of 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
