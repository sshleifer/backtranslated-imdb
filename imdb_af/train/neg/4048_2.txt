Maybe not, but it's terrible. Even the fantastic cast can't save it. OK, I admit it started out very funny, but they seemed to have jumped off the downhill into the Generals house. Bill Murray became a fast-paced, humorous man in a fire hole shouting things to people in the street who were just not funny, as he tried to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV? Come on ...) and ends a national hero after invading another country and the death of God knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the insufficiency and incompetence of the American army and shows how arrogant and imbecile they really are, even if it is unintentional. I actually felt disgusting that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released.
