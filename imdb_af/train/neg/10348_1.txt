I was very excited to see that they ever made a movie from my favorite book. I didn't realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was terrified by the numerous omissions of important parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a movie from a 4-degree book report on the novel. Meg did well at school and not her or her father had glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed as much by a scientist; They left her kitchen lab and replaced it with the internet. And that's just the beginning. At halfway through the movie, I shouted myself on the screen, to the horror of the other people watching the movie not reading the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four inches for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who hasn't read the book, this movie is so good.
