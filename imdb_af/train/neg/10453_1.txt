This movie earns more than 1. But I give it one because so many fricken fan boys gave it a 10, which means it will get a score that will take it into the top 100 list. It's not so good, it's not that bad. It's a stupid classic cult class with so many fricken boys, it's ridiculous. These are the types that are probably still laughing at Chuck Norris jokes and still say, "I'm Rick James!" It doesn't matter how old or irritating it gets. I'm afraid to hear, "I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane" months ago from idiots trying to be funny. His crappy plot crap acting etc. It is good to love a bad movie, but you still have to recognize a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the marine star John Cena to see a real movie
