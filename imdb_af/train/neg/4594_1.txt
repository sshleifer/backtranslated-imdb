I had many problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains basic factual information regarding quantum mechanics, which is good. Although quantum physics has existed for more than 50 years, the film provides this information in a grandiose way that says, "Don't get blown away here!" Well, not really. It is no longer the shattering revelations of the earth. In any case, I was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles must be described by wave equations is not new. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with these things, and it must be kept separate. The people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to saying this by simply thinking of something you can change the matter around you. Therefore, we need to think positively to have positive impact on the world. and make our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not follow logically from quantum theory. For every so-called "expert" they interviewed for this movie, there are many theoretical physicists who disagree completely. They will rightly point out that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support mystical ideas about our spiritual commitment. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that people are going to watch this movie and eat it completely because it makes them feel good. The mainstay of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is so bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" says that most of the assumptions made by people over the world have been untrue since history. Therefore, the assumptions we currently have around the world are likely to be false. Huh? It doesn't quite follow. And even if it did, I didn't see how it helped his argument. I mean, if his ideas have ever become general assumptions, I think we'll have to accept that they're also false, based on his own reasoning.
