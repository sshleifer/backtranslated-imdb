I love these actors, but they were lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder, what did they think they were up to? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called it. in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you like "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably like it too. I both hated. 10/03
