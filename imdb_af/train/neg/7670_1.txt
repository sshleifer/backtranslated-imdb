Well, where do I start my story? I went to this movie tonight with some friends who no longer knew the actors in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. Well, I figured out within the first 20 minutes, which made a bad decision to go out to see this movie. The plot was crazy, and so was the writing. The lines were terrible to the point that people in the audience laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could no longer look plastic. Even some of the scenes seemed to have been made faster ... as they did not drag for any particular reason. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
