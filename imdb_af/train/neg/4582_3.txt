If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend $ 9 on a used textbook, not this movie. I'm a bit worried that the money I spend is being used to buy Kool Aid for shipping to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I don't think the directors really got any point but they seem to be trying to make several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning our lives are deterministic; 2) Science cannot be used to explain everything we do, which means we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world only exists in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough one to follow and 7) put this little piece of paper in your mouth and you'll see some very rough things.
