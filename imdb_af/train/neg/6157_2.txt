Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepy nights where I followed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie. For some of the names in the movie, I expect a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham to such a horrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fences as they talk about survival in a war or a terrible disaster. I mean, I have fenced, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I even watched this whole movie was because the remote fell under the bank and I was too lazy to get it back.
