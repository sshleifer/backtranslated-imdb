This movie is a crappy and forgotten Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally busy, especially by Capshaw, Fishburne, and the usually fixed Ed Harris. Connery may not look like a Harvard Academic. The movie gets worse when it goes. It is a third mystery that is extremely confronted by the time it disrupts. The film drowns an excellent supporting role. George Plimpton also appears in a small role to add Gravitas to Connery because they are discussing the death penalty. The violence and atmosphere pepper a third course of mystery / thriller that is highly manipulated. The writing and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence is the only virtue of the film. Manipulative, Violent and Haunted. 2/10 Avoid it.
