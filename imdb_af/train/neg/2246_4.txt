I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so no comparison. Also, it was a few years, but I didn't grab this story or found its romance fascinating. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are set in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is an exhausted, disillusioned rock star in the background and begins with a romance with a fresh, talented new song sensation, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline. <br /> <br /> Leaders, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are sufficient in their roles, but not their chemistry or plot left much of a point with me. The film is remarkable to me for only one aspect, Streisand's beautiful version of the Oscar winning song Evergreen. She really has a powerful and wonderful voice.
