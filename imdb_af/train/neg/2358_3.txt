In the future of 2001, Freddy is the last surviving teenager of Elm Street. Cause ANY scare for whores to humor and unnecessary celebrity cameos (come on. Ronose ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! WTF?), Tied with part 2 is the worst ever devil's rapist ever has. Wow it was a piece of crap. Not even the big legendary Alice Cooper can leave the stench of this movie. And then hell did Freddy ever have a daughter? The entire film is seriously delayed in any single imaginable way, form and form. Rachel Talalay, you stink at the high sky, baby. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Cast and Crew Bios; Jump to the 3D sequence and jump to a Nightmare option (more extras for the movie can be found on the seventh slide of the Nightmare Collection DVD series) <br /> <br /> Content of the DVD Rooms: Trivia Games; screenplay; and web link
