The original Trancers are not a good movie at all. It had massive plots and had very little in the way of internal logic. However, it was entertaining, better than most low-budget B movies, and can be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not one of these. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffer from many of the same problems of most flop successors. The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is unsatisfactory. It seems that the people behind this movie feel that the best-known faces of the first movie would be back enough and didn't bother with anything else. Not even veteran B-grade actors such as Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this movie out of the mug. <br /> <br /> A brief plot: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a cop of the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first movie, and both with Hap Ashby, the man Deth has been sent to protect in the past. It is discovered that Whistler's brother (the bad guy from the first movie) has traveled early to create an army of Trancers, people have turned into deadly deadly zombies to kill Ashby. Complicating Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife, who died long before Jack, was returned to the past, was also sent back to stop Whistler's brother. Jack finds himself with her now. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. What makes it annoying is that it behaves in a fairly poor example of Soviet Revisionism as it always was the technique. <br /> <br /> The other thing that irritates me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) gets very little screen time. It bothered me a lot, especially since it was much more interesting than the real plot of the movie. It felt like it was just throwing something to fill the space in the movie. Alice's character in particular looks very uncomfortable with the fact that she is only reunited with her husband to find that he is married again, who also wrote her very flat or very poorly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of watching this movie is if you are interested in watching the entire Trancers series (currently six movies). Otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from this low successor.
