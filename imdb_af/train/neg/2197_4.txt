This one returned to the days of the matinee, when children had not been exhausted anywhere, taking their dates to the balcony after immersing their younger brothers and sisters below. It doesn't matter on the screen - the little ones will sit down and the big kids will ignore it. Of course, the adults will never see it. <br /> <br /> But they put it anyway on the video, along with most of the other critical, low-budget golden "B" flashes. .of television. This film's inherent and inadvertent humor is derived from the ancient ideology (the "bad girls" harvested to replace poor John's bruised body - they got it), over-exploited plot (a mad scientist trying to play God) , violent but conscientious monster whose presence in the previously normal-apparent scientist's rural laboratory is never completely explained), and acting that polarize at wood or over. <br /> <br /> It's a great party movie, as your guests enjoy adding dialogue and commenting to other horrible movies. If you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this movie is also available on video in its "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment, in which the host and dolls of the cult TV series make the necessary additions for you.
