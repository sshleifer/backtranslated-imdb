It's like a bad 80's TV program has come loose and is trying to become a soft core film. Oh my god it was bad. The sites of each character had little relevance. The plot itself was not something to speak of. Something about a stalker, I think. In the end, does he shoot himself? It's not really clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they eventually flew with him in the scenes to the scenes ahead. It was barely vigilant. Thank you, I didn't spend any money on it, but I want to have that hour of my life back.
