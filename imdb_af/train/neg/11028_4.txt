Near the start, after it was determined that John Dillinger (Warren Oates) was banned, an egomanian rapist, another 1930s bandit was surrounded in a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), the second officer, investigates the situation, puts a lit cigar in his mouth, automatically picks up two charged .45 caliber and stays alone in the distant house. Afraid, scared, scared. Purvis died alone from home, with the female hostage, the mishreant dead. Everything in the long shot. <br /> <br /> If you are surprised by stories such as Red Riding Hood, it must have considerable appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it is. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his downfall dramatically. Multiple civil code violations. Many shoot outs with Tommy guns and pistols. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> As history stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, partly I guess, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who dismissed Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in pursuit of public attention. <br /> <br /> The photo was written and directed by John Milius. He is the man who wrote it in his contract, that if any animal is shot during one of his productions, he must be the designated shooter. Milius is the man, a compleat gunfreak, who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War, quotes Henry V, "Saint Crispin's Day," and everything. and complete garbage. "I knew I would never take him alive, nor did I try too hard." That is, kill them all and let God choose them. <br /> <br /> You just love it.
