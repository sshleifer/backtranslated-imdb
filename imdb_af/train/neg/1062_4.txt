Ouch! This one was a bit painful to go through. It has a cute and amusing point of departure, but it's all about hell. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville have changed in surprisingly decent behavior. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played the way. I know this is the way the parts are written, and it's hard to blame actors, if the script and director shock them. If you have scandalous characters, it's good, but you need to have good material to make it work. It didn't do that here. Scream away from this movie if possible.
