Whatever I think, I'll probably love the new Star Wars movie, Phantom Menace, that will probably blow the Titanic out of the water, if you forgive the pun, when it comes to the devastating box office receipts, so beat this from the number one place. Every time I hear someone say "Titanic" is the biggest movie they ever saw, I think to myself, "You don't see a lot of movies or how?" What a travesty. You can make 50 great movies that are much better than "Titanic" and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, it won a lot of academy awards, many people really loved it," if anyone can say in his defense. Well, many people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans may be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that part of the problem was the mega-hype about the movie. I waited a month or so to see it and eventually it did not meet the expectations set, which made more attention to the terribly stupid love story. True, "Phantom Menace" is likely to have a similar fate. but. <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" is. a) A cheesy action movie is thinly disguised as a serious period. b) a three-hour epic that gave the best moments in the trailer. c) A juicy love story out of faith or entertainment. d) something went better with documentaries, which I would have enjoyed much more. e) A movie with arrogance that stays to the level shown by the right ship. f) A 3-hour robbery that I will never return, so the biggest motivation for a time machine I can think of. If I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, "I wish I could trade places with you." g) a slap face to any true victim of hypothermia. How long should we believe that people in the cold water can be frozen and still make meaningful sentences? h) Fortunately, a film that has not been recognized by the Oscar for any acting achievements. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and few others. <br /> <br /> The only reason I put it as an anonymous comment is that I do not welcome the rebellion of 10,000 thirteen-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio fans coming to his defense, and I'm not really interested in to hear a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.
