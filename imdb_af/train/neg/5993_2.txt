I grew up (1965) and love the Thunderbirds. All my friends at the school looked. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, at lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. To count off 5 has become an art form. I took my kids to see the movie hoping they would get a look at what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only highlight was the funny theme song. Not that it can compare to the original Thunderbirds count. Fortunately, the early Saturday morning is a television channel still repeating the series Gerry Anderson and his wife. Jonatha Frakes has to submit his director's seat, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Full mess. A CGI remake may be acceptable, but replace puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a big mistake.
