This movie, which was supposedly a thrill, had about five sub-graves that developed simultaneously towards the end of the climax, but ended more than a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was thin, the pace was slow and incompatible. and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks as if he's coming to a gym, Matt Damon pitched it up and the others saw their lines of a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully designed to be politically correct and it did not say anything about big business, oil and the Middle East. I saw that documentaries offer more excitement. Just look at it if there is absolutely nothing else to do.
