I can hardly find it to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and the disk looks good on paper, but the filmography and acting I fear is not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt it is high in their CV filmography. Michael Caine temporarily appeared in the role of the doctor, and I didn't really believe in his character. The plot was incredible especially for the victim's son. Some of the screens were reminiscent of other movies, which I sometimes asked if it was actually a spoof thriller. The lighting was sometimes dark and it added that a low budget film was watched with a few big listed stars, and wondered why I was not bothered to look at it at all.
