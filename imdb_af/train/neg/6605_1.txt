Design only to annoy (or entertain) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director's intention for the viewer was to keep the title character, it would have been good, but I know there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who criticizes America's pro-Marxist 60s movement not a movie maker from the '70s. There is so much idiotic dialogue going on, sometimes I wondered if I didn't actually watch a comedy. You won't be guilty of thinking it's a satire? That's how naive the movie appears. Spacek was in her part of the Leftist movies that brought me to the obvious, inevitable conclusion that the red-headed cop is one of those Hollywood liberal morons. But I mean, aren't they all? Beautiful boobs, but for brains.
