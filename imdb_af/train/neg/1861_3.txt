You know what kind of movie you come in when the main character of the ceremony is transported to the electric chair (which looks like a truck truck), just to clash the prison vehicle with (and I'm not doing this) a genetic engineering tanker. The goo that sprouts, melts and melts its DNA with the snow, we create protagonist, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> However, my favorite part of the movie is an over-the-shoulder shot of the snowman throwing up some poor schmuck, where his hands look suspiciously like some white oven pencil gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
