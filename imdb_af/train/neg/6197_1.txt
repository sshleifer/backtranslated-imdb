At the end of the movie I just asked, "Is this the worst movie I've ever seen or is it the worst movie I've ever seen?". And the answer is ... Actually, after you have seen this movie and thought about its meaning, you just can't find anything and you can only remember the two rape scenes, which are incredibly cruel and useless. It seems to me that the director is trying to push this question into the crowd's head: "What are such crimes compared to the horror of war and extinction?" because I noticed that the two terrible scenes directly linked to the war and that are horrors (during the first scene you can get here, the raped girl gets shouted and at the same time you hear one of President Bush's speeches about the need to start a war with Iraq and in the second scene, the photos of the three criminals who have a sword in a woman's vagina are followed directly by World War II archival photos. facts I really couldn't think of the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horror's expression, which I did, was too shocked by what I just saw and felt (sorry for bad English)
