College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is plagued by nightmares of a cellar house in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting off his own hand, spitting a worm, a ghoul rip open his chest and roasting over an open fire. After his friends lived at a height of 6 feet over his bed, a helpful, occult-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) indicated they were invading Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is to help when things get out of hand! <br /> <br /> The group is stranded, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) gets busy and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil of "Mickey" appears to be the helpful ghost of "Bodybag" lead singer Sammy Mitchell. She teaches Alex how to live out of his body and dance a rock music with repeated nightmare footage to expel the running time. All the victims appear as wisecracking ghosts in the Griffin Thin character in an AMERICAN WORLD IN LONDON. The script is full of plot holes, cheesy dialogue and lame efforts on comedy. Good FX work and cool opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only thing to earn any earnings. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") do some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
