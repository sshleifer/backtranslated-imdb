When we discuss a movie entitled 'Snakes on an Airplane', we must point out early that the snakes are quite important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here is very bad cgi snakes that don't look or move like real snakes. Snakes are terrifying because they look slim, they crawl at an angle. These snakes do nothing of the sort. they slide like they want in a video game. they are cartoon hats. I will go so far as to say that even someone who has a big phobia against the right snakes will not find this one. <br /> <br /> Why would you want to include extreme earthquakes of these cgi failures on earth? why not rely on tension .. the whole 'less is more' ethics. Or better yet, why not make them good in the first place? and maybe even use them sparingly. <br /> <br /> Just look at John carpenters 'the thing'. Here we have a real mucus, and a bit of malignant relationships. 20 years go by and we get this stack of smelly sfx-crap snakes on a plane. when will these people wake up and smell the coffee? special effects are deteriorating! <br /> <br /> sure you can say .. but the movie is a joke, get it? sure I'm with that idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, this movie has a crap dialog. and the music and sound effects are by no means creepy or memorable. <br /> <br /> I could handle every other actor who is part of this movie except Jackson. what did he do there? the man who stood in pulp fiction 10 years ago. is this career progress? Do you offer people value for money? no. I'd like to know what Tarantino thought when he was halfway through the stinker of a movie. <br /> <br /> The current generation has very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer them just what they want. Upon leaving the theater, I saw a number of ads for some real horrible future issues, including ... DOA: dead or alive, another animal movie called 'washed away', and another crazy comedy called 'click . In addition, I saw some terrible trailers, including one for (still) crazy British horror / comedy. I haven't seen the movie industry for a long time like this. <br /> <br /> expect to buy this movie in the DVD bargain section for Â£ 1 in 6 months time. and if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of nice snakes, and some bad cute cool dialogue comes from Samuel L Jackson's Lips. forget about it.
