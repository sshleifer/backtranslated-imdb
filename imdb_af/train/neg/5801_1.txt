Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist investigating the inexplicable investigation. He travels to this small town where it is said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> His car stalls and he is hiding in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she becomes a devil and he kills her, and the town is wondering what the woman has killed ... who I think was the witch, but I'm not quite sure. Ivan is being chased by her spirit, or something, and he must have faith, or something to beat it. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid story and minimal effects. Not to mention that it's not just a Christian movie ... but also a stranger. The voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more comical than terrorism, as it is so high-pitched and shiny. You won't miss much by missing this movie.
