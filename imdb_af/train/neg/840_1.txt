I totally agree with the last commentator. It could be the worst movie ever made. I also had to move forward most of this movie. Michael Madsen must have done this movie to someone like a favor. The picture quality is always grainy. And what little plot is there, is just stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I have a lower score I want. Don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it.
