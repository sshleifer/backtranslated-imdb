A really bad movie. While Rick Baker's special effects are pretty impressive (as turn the stomach), it has no other redeeming qualities. Like many seventy movies, it makes you feel like you have to take a long shower and scrub the slime of you. The characters are uniformly bleak and plot makes no sense.
