The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pigmies and taking them to Scotland and then realizing that they are not animals or subhumans, but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people being kidnapped, such as animals being treated, yet giving such a shallow, stereotypical role to the film. The kidnapping (British anthropologist) eventually becomes the hero of the movie because he "controls" to relate the pygmies ... No idea how the two hostages feel about their trial of their trials ... I find it a flat film, with a one-sided fundamental racist view ... it never manages to move away from the "white men's" view
