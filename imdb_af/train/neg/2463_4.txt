I don't know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen in the past. It is sometimes disturbing but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very complicated and can attract anyone who is in trouble and gossip. I found that I kept my teeth on some of the aforementioned scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore very disturbing. <br /> <br /> The humor of the movie is somehow hidden and is not recognized by anyone. But if you're a fan of strange and strange entertainment and teeth being drilled, it's just the movie you're looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comments and somehow feel attracted by this kind of entertainment. , try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too strange for my taste)
