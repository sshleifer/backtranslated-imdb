If there ever was a call to make a bad movie that would reflect how stupid humanity would be, the one would take the prize. The plot is centered around Bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages from the Scriptures, leading a group of power-seeking thugs to bring about total control over the world. How stupid, does this writer believe that people should actually be? <br /> <br /> The acting was at its best. Casper Van Dien wastes his talent to make this film. Michael York's work was a fair game for the role, as he was the centerpiece of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was sick and very disturbing. No tender or immature thoughts should see this movie. This is how a basic good against the evil plot can be deceived. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental illness floating around the movie circles, looking for ways to market this type of litter. Something had to be censored to get a PG-13 score, but it was still terrible.
