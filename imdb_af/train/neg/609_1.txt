It was an absolutely horrible movie. Don't be lured by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are good actors, but they should be their worst role in history. Even their big play couldn't solve the film's ridiculous story. This movie is an early nineties American propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when Colombian rebels made their case for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared ominous, and her pseudo-love relationship with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that had no real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.
