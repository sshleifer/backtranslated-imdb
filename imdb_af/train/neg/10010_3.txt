Plot is not worth talking about, even if it indicates corruption, murder, power and the rest of the exciting related topics. Characters are sometimes interesting. Not realistic, but interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is slow as a tea drinker ceremony. Visual art not beautiful, but good enough to facilitate eyestrain. Good movie to watch for dinner before going to bed - nothing shockingly too much, nothing overbearing. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I love Woody - great performance. Should the plot be deficient and the work done well. The rest is bearable, but very predictable. The whole is viewable and better than most TV shows.
