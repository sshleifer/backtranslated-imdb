I expected a comedy like the Big Mama movies. Instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This movie has three plots: The first involves Madea and her takes a foster child. The second involves a woman involved in a rich man who abuses her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There's really very little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a band (in a comedic manner) to convince the child to straighten out. The child is indeed turning herself. Apparently it pays kids to beat. <br /> <br /> There are plots dealing with child rape (with the permission of the mother). There are scenes with old men and young girls related to them. (The islands take place at a family reunion.) The movie jumps off plot to plot so you're always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? It's actually nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
