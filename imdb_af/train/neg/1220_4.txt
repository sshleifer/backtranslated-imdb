She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is also a perennial Razzie nominee. Doing a movie so badly should be an indication that she needs money. She can do advertisements about why you should not be talking on a cellphone during a cell phone, especially at night on the way to a busy shopping center. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should stick to the production (Shoot 'Em Up) if she is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> She is applied by four thugs in the parking lot. The first thing they do is have a gun. What is she doing? She started pushing and cursing them like she knew martial arts or something. She succeeds in getting away, but gets lost in the bush after crashing. Why didn't she drive to someone's house? We get four thugs with guns that chase a lady with a toolbox. Of course, their guns are not a game for her wrench. Ha! Of course she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. The poor thugs. <br /> <br /> Now, she's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
