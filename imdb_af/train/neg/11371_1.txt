The "documentary", and we rather use it terms, summarizes that Muslims are trying to take the world violently. Then declare that any Muslim who does not recognize it is either unaware of their own faith or lying to your face! Also, every person interviewed in the film has found a market for their ridiculous actions to sell reality by selling some to conservatives who are willing to make others think. What the West needs to know is that it is nothing more than propaganda aimed at spiritual midgets. If you are looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides several views of qualified sources.
