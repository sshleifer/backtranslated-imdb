I'm a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At the time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this movie and Jenna was the hottest pornstar ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could make of her by making this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they no longer make big porn movies. In a fantasy world, pornstars can act, but they are the real world and they cannot act. That's why there were pornstars, if a woman could act as beautifully as Jenna, she would have tried to go into ordinary movies instead of pornography. Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager through her 20s, she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth. She moved her into low-budget mainstream movies and couldn't act. Where is she now? I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she made "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we don't want to hear you talk, as much as we want you to have sex. Also, Jenna would have many more fans and more money in your bank account if you did anal on film.
