As mentioned before, the visual effects are amazing. They are awesome. I use Blender personally and graphics are not easy at all. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the plot confusing, but the overall conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to run away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the room from the bottomless pit, Proog explains that "one step out of place and (you're dead)". Here there is a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, from nowhere, murdered Emo. Proog immediately changed from a caring guardian to a lost child to be a sick man. He betrays us. Not only is it depressed, but we do not care, because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not being developed. It is not a story about someone, by struggle, getting stronger. It is depressed and does not show because there is no great truth about the human soul or the world being revealed as a great drama. In my opinion, the film is poorly underdeveloped in all respects. However, the graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than mere eye cakes. There is no truth, no fight and a bad surprise. Finally, an underdeveloped movie without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
