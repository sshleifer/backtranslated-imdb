I found Darkness to be just DARK. It has some kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and some ghastly moments to let you go UGH! BUT, it was alert to confusion. You don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a movie shot at Super 8 Film, you already have that unpleasant grain. As with Nathan Schiff movies, this is just too much. Director Leif Jonker would like to make an original film, but he does not have the know-how to do it. The camera was never placed in the right place, lacking basics like how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to hurt a movie as well. The actors are all fairly uneven and hammy. But despite these negatives, the music is good, the gore is alot and ranges from foolish putty to very good devices. Is this a classic as it says? Is it worth the worth of the two slides? NO. But it's a good first three. Now if these guys stop beating themselves over this movie (from what I understand here the only one they've ever done) for a while and try again, they can do better.
