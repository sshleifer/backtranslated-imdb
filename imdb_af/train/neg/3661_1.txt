Unknown to the man, he was attacked by a werewolf and now he is the curse. Associated with such creatures, our hero must jump against time to rid himself of this terrible tribulation before the next full moon, "according to the DVD hat's synopsis. <br /> <br /> Roughly produced by the original Spanish, "The Fury of the Wolf Man" lost any charm he had in its original form.

The often incoherent story is not even sadly amusing.
