SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it's like watching a short shit on SNL is a bit stupid. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid crap. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder is just funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy tries hardest and people think he's funny. Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was really funny with Andy was the pool area. <br /> <br /> They could've made the "Quiet Place" much better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part where he pronounces his H's is delayed. They try it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while acting ... he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for the simple people with the brain of a 10-year-old level of comedy. It's about half the United States.
