Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to struggle with each other. This time, future travelers traveled in 1992 and recruited some people to return with them until 1944 and prevented the creation of Godzilla, which will save a future Japan of destruction. But after this task is reached, time travelers are revealed to be a bunch of double cruisers whose own creatures are on the brink, and with no Godzilla to stop them? Eek! It sounds very stupid, and it's probably, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks good too. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish rather than enjoyable rubbish, and the movie seems to be just as dull as its predecessors. Look out for the shaky Spielberg-in-joke.
