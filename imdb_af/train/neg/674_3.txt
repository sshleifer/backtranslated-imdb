I am known to fall asleep during movies, but it is usually due to a combination of things, including, very tired, warm and comfortable on the seat and just eating a lot. But on this occasion I fell asleep because of the movie junk. The plot development was constant. Constantly slow and dull. Things looked right, but with no explanation of what they caused or why. I admit that I missed a part of the movie, but I watched the majority of it and everything seemed to happen without any real concern for anything else. I can't recommend this movie at all.
