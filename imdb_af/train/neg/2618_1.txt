... because it was just terrible. 101 Dalamatians were funny, even though not formal, but nothing more than puerile drives. The same plot except with the story being cut from it; the world's most intelligent and terribly annoying macaw; Tim McInnerny proves he can't really do comedy (ever, Percy remembers in Blackadder, but it was his highlight - it's been downhill ever since); way so poor that if a group of college students made it, you throw it in the bowl and tell them to do it again - this time around. Ieuan Grufford goes back better to Hornblower sharpish, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu have to hide for a few years. Maybe I can be too hard; After all, I didn't manage to sit down the whole movie. It gets 1/10; just because I can't give it 0.
