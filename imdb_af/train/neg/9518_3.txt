Poor performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Larger underdeveloped supporting characters. Annoying talky with no real plot. Finish letting you flatter as a pancake, with more loose points than you could attach in four pursuers (that's if you even cared about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. The penultimate order in which the "Chicago hood" is looking for the Sinatra character is laughing. The music in that order is also poor. And in the final scene when Martin's character removed his hat for the woman, he called a "pig", I almost let go and got a stone to throw through my television screen.
