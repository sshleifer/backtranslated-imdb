I really look forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters. I don't like this program because it takes fantasy on an incredible level. The World Speed ​​Record for Helicopters was established by a Westland Lynx at 249 mph a few years ago. The only chopper ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. It hit more than 300 and was a compound helicopter, which meant it had a pusher propeller at the end of its hull. It does not offer any helicopter more than 275 due to the rotation principle. wing flight. And the Bell 222, the "actor" depicted by Airwolf, wasn't very fast, even by helicopter standards. And it didn't last very long in production. <br /> <br /> There was a movie that came out during this period, called "Blue Thunder" which was much more realistic.
