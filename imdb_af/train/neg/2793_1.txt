This is on top of my top list of the worst movies I've seen on Starz on Demand so far. It looks as if they are picking up straight on DVD slots that they can find and attach to them. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shocking budget can get a horror movie and put it on TV. To be honest, it looks terrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were movies that worked around their low budget or in other cases just needed the low budget to be big. <br /> <br /> It's not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You now know the plot, I'm sure if you read it. Or you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason, you got bored on this page. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl who has come to know us for 3 minutes in an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video. Whoever brings it along, thought it was really interesting, but it really wasn't. Anyway, she killed herself. Then she owns someone. Then some murder begins. It is really irrevocable and as completely average and boring as possible. When the first shootings go into her apartment, it sounds very serious like a piece of popcorn. Was it the best sound effect they could get? I could find a better sound effect to use for free (without copyright) on the internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Don't let the other reviews claim it's a 10-star movie school. They are, of course, either distributors of the movie or even the director trying to imagine that this piece of junk is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Laughable.
