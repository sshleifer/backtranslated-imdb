Someone called editing. It was badly changed and what started out as somewhat intriguing has become an incomprehensible mess. To begin with, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choices for the type of experiments in which they are involved? And, what exactly do they test? Apparently there is a big plan that an agency will exploit. The acting is pretty bad. Everyone is emotional. Everyone holds secrets. They often mention that if it wasn't for the money, they hung it up. There is a confused minister who emits Scripture. On and off. But again, the biggest hangout is the lack of a playing field for the actors. There are some very cheesy elements. The little ones and the chaise lounges. The terrible wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting but didn't look right.
