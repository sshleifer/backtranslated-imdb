If you want to know what kind of white music people listened to in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you also have to listen to a lot of whistles and violets (see my remarks about My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> Losing admission: I approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, after just seeing his predecessor. But as an attacker who was preparing to finally search for my mother-in-law, My Girl 2 looked at me, looking for a mother. <br /> <br /> Another way, anything I liked about My Girl 2 has nothing to do with My Girl 2, but about a protagonist who, like many adopts, asks, "Who is my mom" ? And if my mother's home movies are in a actor, I'll make sure my own movie is about it. <br /> <br /> People are listless. Movies shouldn't be listless. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... listless. Avoid being a full juice comforted by a series of little annoyances.
