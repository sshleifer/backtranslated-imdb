This movie portrays Ruth as a woman, hard drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure thrown in with a little baseball. Babe Ruth's early life was very interesting and it was omitted for all purposes in this movie. Lou Gehrig was also barely covered and it was a well-known relationship, good or indifferent. It had to be better covered than it was. His life was more than anything bad. He was an American hero, an icon that many baseball greats have their lives to their pattern. I feel that I am fair in reminding a great baseball player who totally ignored this movie. Shame on the makers of this movie for the capitalization of his mistakes and not his greatness.
