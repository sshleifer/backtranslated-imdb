Nothing will ruin a movie as a combination of a poor writing and a poor direction. This is the case with "The Mummy's Tomb." <br /> <br /> The script is remaining ideas from older, better Universal horror flicks such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." The direction is slow and old. The acting is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis is poor compared to Tom Tyler's "The Mummy's Hand" and the manufacturers are foolish enough to make Christy Cabanne's much better prequel footage and show the weakness of their own movie! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this movie was and, two years later, initially turned it down as 'The Mummy's Ghost' with a better script and better director. The result was probably the best movie in their four-film "Mummy" cycle, though not as close as Karl Freund's original 1932. <br /> <br /> Cabanne's footage raises this movie to a 3. The "new" stuff is a 2 at its best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably happy to see their characters bump, so they no longer needed to appear like that drunk!
