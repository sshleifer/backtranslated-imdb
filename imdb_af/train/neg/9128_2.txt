Even if one did not realize that sellers were poor during the filming and died before the film's release, the FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU will be painfully viewed. It's probably a lampoon of Sax Rohmer's well-known Oriental villain but it has no focus. The potential for satirical comment on the anti-Eastern overtones of Rohmer's concept is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. There are virtually no real jokes or gags, just mostly actors behaving foolishly and spitting grim lines. It is especially disturbing to see Sid Caesar spraying fools and racial orders for attempted laughter. Most of the other actors also embarrass themselves. <br /> <br /> Then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual role of sinister Fu Manchu, who tries to refine a formula to regain his youth and his solid British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; He gives a strange warmth to Smith when he discusses his fetishist attachment to his lawnmower and moves strangely like Manchu as he expresses his love for the English music hall entertainment. But most of the time he plays both roles with fatigue, and then sabotages any comic possibilities. Vendor routines where he revives his fading power with electric shocks are particularly rude; He seems too convincingly annoyed to be funny. <br /> <br /> A few truly quirky lines, a bit slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk (Cato in the PINK PANTHER movies) as one of Manchu's minions, and Helen Mirren's amusing musical numbers can't do this do not save mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comic genius, they will learn nothing from the FAST PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
