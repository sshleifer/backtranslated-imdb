Many people are equal to the movie, so I feel somewhat bad and give it a bad review. But after sitting 96 minutes, I felt I had to do it. Where's the plot in this movie? I had missed it, I waited for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened. Probably the end was "somewhat shocking," but they didn't build it up. I forgot who was half the time, so they didn't really develop the characters. The acting was so-so, most of the time it was credible, but I could see most of the time through it. So ... without giving away anything, I have to say that unless you like the actors in the movie, there's no real reason to watch this movie. I can be wrong, but I just didn't understand why there was so little or too much of the movie. I can't decide which one to be, so I'm telling you. I don't even know if it's a good idea, the cost and everything ... Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel so high, I stay with me vote at the top.
