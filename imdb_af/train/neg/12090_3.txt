Although I can see the potential redeeming qualities in this movie through his plot, I certainly thought that the painful nature of the scene structure was too many of most viewers. Big holes in the script like they never explained, "your dad died." The mother's comments made it even harder to make sense of these characters. <br /> <br /> It won first place in Cannes in 2001, a shocking consideration. Perhaps the French hunger for film noir that year and was desperate for something as sadistic as this movie. I understood the long screens as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when it matched the inability to relate to the main character, it went too far for me and me in the arms of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one that is not satisfied with the fact that he watched a movie as soon as it is over. I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which was much more alarming, but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. Seeing these teachers slowly and painfully at the scene has become so redundant that I found it boring - and I wanted to keep this movie every time.
