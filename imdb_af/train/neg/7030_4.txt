One of the cornerstones of the low-budget theater is a well-known, classic story and a complete bastardization. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The scriptwriter takes the enduring Fantasy of the Opera story and moves it into a late 80's shopping mall. But the "Phantom's" goal is just to take revenge on those responsible for disfiguring his face and killing his family. The special effects provide a good chuckle, especially when body parts appear in dishes from the yoghurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as unpleasant as he would expect, mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame has not yet arrived. If you're looking for some good laughs, at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, watch this movie. Otherwise, look for something else.
