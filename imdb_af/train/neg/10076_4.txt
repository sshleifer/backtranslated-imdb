The difficult relationship between this film and the first Grease was set right at the start of the film when Didi Conn, one of four members repeating their roles, approached young Maxwell Caulfield, a British exchange student. Although in previous film, Olivia Newton, St John's strange speech pattern is not explained, it is explained here. Caulfield is her cousin. What is Conn still doing in school, I think she just likes hanging around Rydell High, although she is now a beautician. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a clever kid, so of course, the caper types led by Adrian Zmed marked him as a nerd. And it is especially bad when Zmed's girlfriend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd won't cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to set up a modern Zorro act. He gets a rubbish bike and puts it back together and teaches himself to drive. He gets himself a leather bike outfit with a pair of glasses to hide his face. If Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will have no trouble making friends at any gay male bar as he is restless. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 launched Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started with them. The successful career paths both enjoyed. If you've seen the first Grease movie, a much better movie, then you definitely have an idea how this movie will come out. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original Victim in their roles. The music score is not as good as the songs coming from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not that good.
