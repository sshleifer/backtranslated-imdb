It offers nothing less than a movie length version of the 1970s TV hit 'Love, American Style', with a flash of nudity. 'Superchick' (1973) is a shiny piece of fluff that can somehow still be entertained. And the main character here, Tara B. True, is really a kind of superchick. A stewardess (not a pilot) who looks so good that even her plane's auto-pilot made her a success rate! And with a quirky boyfriend in every port, this swingin'gal puts the "lay" in "layover." With her germaphobe surgeon in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creative challenged rock star husband in L.A., Tara is sure to stay busy. And if she doesn't discharge these guys from all their masculine energies, it's like the viewer learning, a karate class, a mile high club that fights whistles and rapists, attending groovy pot parties. And a hijacking attempt on her plane stopped. . As I said, light sad, and definitely good for a night when you feel a bit brain-dead and just want to smear just before the tube. Future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings some nice charm to her role as Tara, and the movie looks nice enough to please. Disappointingly, the fruits of the 70s of the 70s, Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still have to do what they do best - show their chest! Although the picture is never extremely funny and doesn't have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it manages to be consistently amusing, and I think it's something. Strange that the end credits need to pay attention to me. Jillson's body double; Don't think I saw it before!
