The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute's return to her hometown for the fun of a sister / friend. There are some other small story lines that may be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully investigated. The core of the movie is the funeral, wake-up and later controversy about the future of a community of crones who make and sell dolls to buy vodka, but now lack the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently the movie is unsaved. The prostitute's journey from town to town is an unrelenting endless train ride and bumps through the mud. Perhaps it is our intention to impress us with the immunity of the Russian landscape. The town itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one man, the common of the dead girl. Continuing the pop industry is problematic for everyone involved and ultimately seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand camera that can cause discomfort. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do not include the songs and rods of the crones. Don't go to this movie unless you're in Russian.
