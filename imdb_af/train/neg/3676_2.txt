Susan Swift is a handsome youngster, a flower child who was transplanted after the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but she does not have the vocal series for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to swallow; She is quite nice and has bright eyes and a nice smile. In "The Coming" (as it was mentioned when it was briefly released to the theaters), Swift can be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The movie is very low-budget and borrows from so many other pictures I gave it about 15 minutes to go. It starts out strong and has a few camp apples. It is clear that there are more serious films dealing with the Salem gate trials that are deserved to be seen about this; But, if rubbish films go, it's not too terrible. The Boston venues are a definite plus, and the supporting role play is almost hammy. * 1/2 of ****
