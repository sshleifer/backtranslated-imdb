There is an interesting discussion in this movie. Is a moral person good enough or do you need anything more? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that without the guidance of God, a morally good person is not enough. There is a line early in the movie: "You and I can look at one who is morally good, but both know he's going to hell." <br /> <br /> While I'm not a Christian, discussions about this in the movie were fascinating, but not in the way the movie was meant. I left the movie with a stronger feeling that it is morally good * is * enough. The arguments and discussions presented were very biased, so much so that they were satisfied with the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when it is distracted in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As George Carlin's character said in Dogma: "Crochet while they are young." <br /> <br /> The basic premise is also a very interesting one. A bible from the 1890s tries to publish a book that says that morality without God is good, as long as the morality is meaningful. Do you just tell a child not to steal? Or don't you tell him to steal because God doesn't tell you? (No matter what it means the child doesn't steal, because, how will he feel if it's his marbles stolen?) The author, Carlisle, wants the school's recommendation to help sell the book (to spread the world). However, it needs unanimous consent, and one of the scholars has it against. He brings in a very interesting discussion early in the film about morality for morality for the sake of God's word-argument. To prove his point, he produces a time machine (puts the film only to make the plot work, which I'm good at), and sends Carlisle to the year 2002 to see where the teachings of morality without God will lead us. /> As it should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees, and has turned himself back at the time of his return (because he is returning, it's not really a destroyer, it's a bible movie). <br /> <br /> Regarding the film as a movie, it was fairly slow and reasonably poor. Something not needed in this movie is that it produces two "bad guys" trying to figure out who Carlisle is, even if he didn't hurt anyone, committed a crime or something. What is wrong with the film that shows Carlisle's opinion, shows his view of this "sinful world" and returns him with a new perspective? <br /> <br /> There are also some points in the movie that confirm that I'm happy. I'm not a Christian, or at least someone who says, "It's God or nothing." Three near the end of the movie disturbed me. First, when the two "bad guys" Carlisle just before he jumps, Carlisle turns his * only * really despicable act. He falls as Jesus' time comes, and makes it the "bad guys" (who are also Christians, oddly enough), thinking they missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after returning from Carlisle, he finds a boy in which he shouted at the beginning of the movie not to steal (but God didn't mention, the child kept the marbles and run away) and tell him the time it steals is wrong because God commands it. Like the Carlin quotation above, scared children in religion are a faux pass in my book. <br /> <br /> And lastly, the epilogue. Another scare tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far in the future they can go, and he says he doesn't know. The epilogue shows that he is trying to start a bible in the distant future (starting at 2100) and failing it. The years with 10, and again, trying, and by fading, he is like 2030 or so. In the course of the film, Carlise mentions that he has experienced the end of the world, because the world was great with sin and the loss of God's name. Terrorist tactics have been used for thousands of years. You will think in these things. Enlightened times, the church would also be enlightened. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. While I was pretty sure before it was morally good, it was enough, now I know it for a fact. Worth watching if you're not a Christian, to confirm how happy you should be as ignorant as the people in this movie.
