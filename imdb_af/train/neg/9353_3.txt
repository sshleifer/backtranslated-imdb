I founded the title ... I expected an informative and intriguing journey to alcoholism, but I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rough shot. <br /> <br /> The main character is not much given. psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify cute teenage-like poetry as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a pity because the essence of the story could have been good, with a better effort to portray the inner feelings. from a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems more like "I'm the way I am, because that's the way I am." And the laughingly bad attempt to give a similar poetic edge to a lower classmate makes it even worse. A cheap way to make a dull movie looks like it's a clever, artistic and meaningful picture. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not very clever, artificial or significant ... The leading character does not develop at all, and the poor attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt, it rather fell out of the blue. <br /> <br /> The movie is heavily borrowed from classics such as a Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but eventually they fail to regain their greatness, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest, and we give a movie that is pleasing to the eye, but uncomfortable for the brain.
