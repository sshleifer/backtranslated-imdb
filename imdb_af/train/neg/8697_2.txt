Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why does it even review this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those deadly (and many fake-looking) prehistoric monsters, runs to kill people. The original was bad enough, the successor was even worse. It falls somewhere in between, but not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR movies. RATING: 2 out of 10. Graded R for graphic violence and gore, creepy images and profanity.
