To begin with, I must point out that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you don't know why or what for. When you finally find out, you just realize it's a twisted soup opera dealing with adult prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate boys. The characters are pretty poor and the actors (especially the little ones) don't help them to make them credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a wonderful actress, no matter if the movie is pure litter. <br /> <br /> The only positive things about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" good intentions, and he has filmed a few scenes that are very intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
