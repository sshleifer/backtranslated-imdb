David Mamet's film debut was considered by many to be a real thinker's movie, a movie that you all and everyone asks. I saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a female psychologist called Margaret, who is also a best seller. Margaret is disillusioned with her profession and her inability to really help anyone. She tried to fix it by settling her patient's gambling debt on a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, which is the only reason to watch this movie). She discovers that Mike is actually a professional trust man when she almost falls victim to a scam he meets immediately after her. Frustrated she comes back to see him and asks him to show her how artists work (she plans to use it as a subject of a new psychology book). She then falls for him and accompanies him for a long time that he and his associates have set up. <br /> <br /> I don't feel like going into detail, but at the end of the movie it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were a comprehensive concept of Mike and his loved ones Margaret out of $ 80,000 to oppress. <br /> <br /> First, the big turn at the end was very predictable. Any scene where the girls were working was made very clear by the stages acting and strange line. Not only that, but the audience (and the main character) know they are talking to men. Is it such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has hurt herself? In addition, Margaret is presumably an intelligent psychologist who is an expert in reading people, but she allows her to easily dup - and remember, she knows Mike is an artist. <br /> <br /> Secondly, we were led to believe that Margaret had been knocked down from the beginning, but eventually getting the job done, she had to do several things that the men could not have predicted that she would do not. First, she had to decide to settle her patient's debt so she could meet the first men in the first place. If she did not, the whole could have failed. I just have to say that it is fairly unreasonable to assume that a psychologist will take it himself to settle a patient's gambling debt. Not only that, but what is the chance that people will be in the right place at night, she decides to show up? Did they appear every night at the pub every night, hoping they would see them? Another thing that could not be predicted was that Margaret had to stop seeing Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. What is the chance of this happening? And yet the whole concept is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was with the end. Margaret finds out she was snapped and decided to get revenge on Mike. Initially, we are leading Mamet to believe that she is going to go, but it falls, so the ultimate end is that Mike gets her into an airport luggage area. Somehow it just felt like an awkward and unclear way to end a movie about artists doing their trade. Not only that, but she did not even return the money he had stolen from her. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie makes you feel empty and unfinished. And if, like me, you predicted that Margaret would be crushed, you would find this revelation just as unsatisfactory.
