This movie is mediocre at its best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. Her bitchy behavior of "Law and Order" carries over in a failed attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one that comes out of harmony in this terrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to get out of this mess is Charlie and Denise's marriage. Hopefully that effort will deliver better results.
