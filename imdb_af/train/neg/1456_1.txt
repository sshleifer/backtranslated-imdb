Simply put, it's a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, has to tell you that it will not try to be deep or do much to Hitler's character. First, from the first minute of the movie where we see that baby Hitler looks angry with evil music playing in the background, we get a picture of Hitler who presents him as a cartoon supervisor, apparently only from a Saturday morning TV -show has been ripped off. The movie really wants his case that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, it is so boring and confusing to make him such an unequivocally evil character (one has to ask how the unclear, fictional character in the cold film ever persuades a nation to follow him or the name of Time's man of the year). This film had a wonderful opportunity to take a figure that has committed some of the most terrible acts in the 20th century and is trying to submerge in its mind. Instead, it just says, "Hey! Hitler was angry! Just think you'll love ..." over and over. The big irony is that the film is still attacked to show sympathy to the character. Give me a chance.
