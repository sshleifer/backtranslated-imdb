In my book "Basic Instinct" was a perfect movie. It played excellently on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the smallest role. It has had wonderful photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All this is a movie that's as good as it ever will! <br /> <br /> This sequel is exactly the opposite, it can't get worse, bad acting and a lame script combined with totally inactive direction, it's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that slightly concentrates on you is the relatively short wait for the next scene which is an exact re-enacted copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh and I laughed a lot despite myself, because it was like looking at breaking down a shiny monument. The only good thing about this terrible mess is the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score from BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-white responsible for the script even included the "There is no smoking in this room" dialogue in the interrogation scene and yes, she is sending her lawyer (who is now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this horrible movie that never had to be made! It damages the original, so bad. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms Stone pays the best surgeon who can buy money) can do a good job, but of course can't restore the perfection of the original. And as far as the human body is concerned, it also applies to movies. There must be a law: never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
