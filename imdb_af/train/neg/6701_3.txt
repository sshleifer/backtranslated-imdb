For years I have been an environmentally conscious and was really looking forward to this show. I used it to record all episodes, because I thought I could really learn a lot of new things. I can probably get past Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I'm sure many of these have been staged to look like a reality show and call on that reader. It doesn't work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle. Because Ed is such a great letter of information, maybe a second show that is really serious about the environment is a good idea. Dumbing things off is not necessary for some of us. <br /> <br /> I don't pick up any more episodes or look at the show, but let me know if a real glow in the works might be.
