Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching, I thought it was good. But the plots just got worse. The storyline was too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he is silly. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the silliest character of the show. How could a mother treat her own son, okay if it was the daughter-in-law, but it was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a bit funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a good job. Don't know how these shows are playing for so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored as I was and have nothing else to look at, I suggest you watch it.
