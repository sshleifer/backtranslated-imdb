I gave it a pure four from its historical context. It was considered lost for many years, until it appeared in Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Tired is the straight man and Larry and Curly play as a duo. Spade Cooley has a few numbers. I think it has something to do with the work on a farm. I'm not quite sure because the plot was so little that nothing really stuck in my memory. I vaguely remember that it is a Western musical comedy. Even the Stooge seems to be going through the movements. Overall nothing is really recommended. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan, don't bother it. If you're a stooge fan, stick to the shorts.
