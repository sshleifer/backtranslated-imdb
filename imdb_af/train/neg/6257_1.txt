Destroyers. Strange people have reviewed this movie. Allow me to add balance by explaining the following: <br /> <br /> Scripture: Terrible. As Tom and Dan get to know each other, "talk about movies, the talk is clear from one person, and I suspect it was the director who did his words carefully to sound intelligently. Then Dan asks:" Have you ever heard of the HIV virus? "And it sounds about as natural as asking," Did you communicate with the nine alien races? "<br /> <br /> Acting: White teeth and a chisel face do not make a sensitive Performanceman Speedman did well enough with what he was given, I suspect, but Marsden was horrific - indifferent, unbelievable, and straightforward in his imprisonment. /> <br /> Plot: Save me! The moments of half-flight were not exciting, but annoying and weak. Remember Marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throw it down: "They don't work, man!" Tee-hee and beware of the semi-black-and-white flashbacks, which are starting with some choppy sounds that are missing from CSI and others drama drama is taken. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the most dangerous, evil and offensive, is the homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a movie in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan could get the condom or didn't use it at all - excuse me, where was Tom having sex? There are a few omissions of the insertion partner who come as a villain of the gay man in general. <br /> <br /> Total: Beware!
