How does a Scotsman make love in the chunky purple heather? Very, very carefully. Now I have the clear advantage over many of the judges because I was born in Scotland. Too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "four legs good - two legs bad," as Orwell had. Jessica Lange emphasizes that the Wells - next - the - sea Amateur Dramatic Society 's production of "Brigadoon" would decrease. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose Great Granny once pulled off at Edinburgh Waverley. And the Auld enemy? Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame everything? Mr Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed of such racist stereotyping. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" looks like a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
