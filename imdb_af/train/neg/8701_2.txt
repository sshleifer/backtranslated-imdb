It's probably one of the worst "wants to be a low budget hit movies" to credit the dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable that you can get away, cook dinner yourself, answer the phone or whatever and when you are back, you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so poor you would have thought Lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that it looks like a pet dog like a super predator. The play was overcooked. They try so hard, but there's just not enough character behind them to get into the characters and for the scientist ... Yes, we know exactly what is going to happen to the blonde chick in the glasses. Stereotypical was created for movies like this. If you want to see this movie, I suggest you are not in a serious mood as the throw and crew were natural. And if you're really into dinosaurs and knowing everything in the world about them, don't look, you can break the screen - the facts are so far.
