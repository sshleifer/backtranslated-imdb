First, I have no idea how this movie made it on the big screen. It's not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, it's just awful. My friend and I love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. Expected this movie to expect this movie a Transformers with dragons, senseless entertainment. All we got was a senseless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so terrible with the play, it makes it good. It's basically a Chinese dragon dragons returning every 500 years ... Sounds like a good repetition of Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to deeper than it should leave, not just plots, but with magic and a very small real war between dragons (rather big snakes) it just becomes ridiculous. The director tried to add some humor to the movie which failed. My friend and I laughed through the whole thing (with all 5 of the audience) and can't believe we spent money on it. The short trailer on TV makes the most of the action while the shit makes the rest. I've seen lots of B-movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say if you don't want to laugh for an hour, watch it. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> I don't drink ... but it would have helped before watching this movie.
