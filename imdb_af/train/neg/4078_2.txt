JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is, as the name implies, a ghost story. The theme is meant to be horror, but comes closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who is brutally murdered comes back from death. This means this movie is trying to go off as a plot. There is nothing left about it. The film consists of a series of loose screens involving a man who had a relationship with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the opening styles, this movie has the appearance of a straight-forward DVD attempt, unlike jewelery like VACANCY 2, the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and definitely gives it a straight-to-DVD movie a bad name! The direction is as poor as it can be with a complete lack of tension, fright or tension, even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent a bit more boring than even the worst soap opera you might have had the lasting accident. <br /> <br /> The play across the board is absolutely uncomfortable, without any actor being involved in driving showing even the slightest potential of a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. I'm exaggerating! <br /> <br /> rather than give 1 is because some of the poor in combination with even worse d made a match for some unintentional laughter. I emphasize the word "little" in that sense. It's not quite one of the bad-it-good movies like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, look at those movies. If you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts, look at the LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGE, RINGU, THE EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, ONE BREAK or TELEPHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who has had the good fortune to prevent JESSICA from being seen: a GHOST STORY to keep up the good work! Just forget about this movie. Don't worry about it!
