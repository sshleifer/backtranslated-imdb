It is level hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic story of a jealous young woman's scheme to dismantle her father and his fiancee. Is it incest or just a sight through the eyes of a girl with an Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are empty and dirty. Seberg is poor (I agree with the "boys with breasts" commenting on a previous review). The plot plundered. This predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of movie that was unfortunately over an hour and a half! If you want to see big gowns and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend catching a thief - in which you will get the extra bonuses of an entertaining story and similar characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies to entertain me. I don't really care where a movie was set. Whatever the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see nice characters. It doesn't hurt if I can talk to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a typical good performance, and also David Niven in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The "2" rating is exclusively for Kerr and Niven, and for cinematography - the rich color schemes and the dark, intermittent black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography in the world cannot save a poor story with incredible characters. A saw's ear is still a saw's ear. As a result, it was a serious waste of my time.
