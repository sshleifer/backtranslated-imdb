This US soap opera, 'Knots Landing', has all the entertainment value to be trapped in an elevator. Each episode contains sites such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not much different from the other drama performances of the period. Regarding the film, I saw better actors on a cereal. From the mid to late '90s, repetition of' Knots' U.K Gold shattered like a mountain of milduw cloths. I'm sorry to announce that I had to suffer because my mother was a big fan of the show and would consider it religious. Although since then, re-runs are few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said of Knots is the striking saxophone signature shot, which is later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, The Upper Hand. Great legacy, eh?
