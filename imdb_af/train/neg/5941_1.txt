As a fan of Notorious B.I.G, I look forward to this movie. I'm sorry to see it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows Notorious B.I.G. 's real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to honor their father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In a nutshell, nobody is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with these is the real people they play. It was boring and had no information on Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-supporters did not already know. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress who was wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The movie snails and snails also think Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend a lot of money on it. It is unfortunate to say that this has happened. It is nowhere near a good movie. I expected so much from it, but unfortunately I didn't get anything from me. I think you should definitely hit this one.
