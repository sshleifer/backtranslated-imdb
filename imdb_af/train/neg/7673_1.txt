I don't know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before she sits in another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he has his character's motivation of Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater sleeps through this drink. The direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gun fight?), Costumes (bulletproof jackets with muscles on them), and hey, there's also no observable plot. It amazes me that no one is connected to the project and said, "Hey guys, it doesn't make sense, let's start again." Hopefully Slater's career may come from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Hands off the worst movie I've ever seen.
