I tried to watch this movie twice, and even then quickly forward the annoying parts, but couldn't make it to the end. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how this movie * really had * good reviews. I think these people give such good reviews, just try to market the movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews look very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more miserable. Movies should get real positive comments on their own steam and not be confronted !! <br /> <br /> The play was reminiscent of a cheesy porn movie, and not in a funny way. I don't mind a low budget movie with bad acting if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I found the main character to be annoying. His facial expressions and humor were unbearably childish. I thought it was deliberate to make the conspiracy of women look more delicious and established, but it was even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very uncomfortable (his heads have an exaggerated business speech) and the unwavering sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything about this movie except the attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt a rating was misleading. I was interested in his point of departure, but feared everything. Of course, see it if you want, but I just didn't want anyone else to get their hopes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
