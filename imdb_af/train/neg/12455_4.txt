I remember seeing it in the forefront when I was about 7 years old. At the time I was a big comic book reader and everything related to superheroes was heavily anticipated. The end result was, however, inferior. <br /> <br /> I was aware of the Prince stories of Emma Peel, as they only recently came to an end and Diana returned to her Amazon form. But there was so little action I was bored in most of the movie. The last costume was an interesting idea but looks more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my late teens. It didn't improve much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more famous, thanks to Incredible, but her acting wasn't any better. The writing had some good ideas, like the villain Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they had to build the back. story better, and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too much like a fine spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The Amazon elements were intriguing, but had to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force producers to go back to the drawing board and make something more faithful, a little to camp and a low budget. The budget was also quite low here, and superheroes didn't come cheap. <br /> <br /> It will be nice to make the movie available on DVD, as a comparison and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and it has nothing about this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It's important to watch for curiosity and for some inspiration and caution for future releases.
