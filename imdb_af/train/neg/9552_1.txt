Not good old, stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not the good stupid like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood movies, it's probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen. To give this movie a golden Turkey is an insult to turkeys. Calling this movie is offensive even to stupid people. <br /> <br /> If it's the future of American cinema and art, we are better off starting the world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash off this insult to my single heart. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie if you're suicide.
