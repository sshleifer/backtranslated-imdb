The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle that doesn't break down. But the movie fails to continue. Instead, it pushes for 45 minutes while blowing a preamble before making the big discovery. As audiences do not benefit much from seeing a sneaky child discovering things, it's a strange choice: the movie has been successfully prevented from entering any topic. As soon as the dust is discovered, the movie establishes too fast that both large-scale and blue-collar coworkers want the invention to be slapped and leave the movie with just two thin movements; find out about the chemical, and run of suppressors. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why anyone would describe it as a comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. It's more like a serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism weakens both supply chains and production. This again prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, it's probably true, but without playing with an attitude to the fact, the movie is just a serious argument. You will need a very broad definition of comedy to find any here. <br /> <br /> It's more like a British meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
