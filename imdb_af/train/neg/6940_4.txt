If you have two tower houses of exhibitors against each other, you can expect the exceptional chamber society, and this is the case in this film where we have a 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan novel, a 34-year-old Tabu. Wait! In fact, it's all there in the name of the plot, instead of "cheeni", it's the content "Kum" in this Adman, author director R. Balki's girl effort. <br /> <br /> Trust the two senior actors to bring home with their wise cracks and bittersweet moments when love has happened in this unconventional couple, and that's all you find in slow but refreshing first half. The places of London as trapped in the rainy season are fascinating. By the end of the first half romance had completed and achieved mission. There is not much more to say. Therefore, in the second half, a strange opposition in the form of girl's father comes to the extent that he is going for a Satyagrah, really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how he gives. The result, the second half is dry, flat without energy. There is a subplot with a girl who dies of cancer, which doesn't make much impact. Nevertheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performances.
