It would have been a * big * silent movie. The acting is really good, at least in a Look Ma, I really do great work! kind of way. <br /> <br /> Everything is GREAT. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is donated by human hearing! <br /> <br /> Usually, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train swing, I couldn't tear my eyes. This dialogue may have worked on stage, although I doubt it. On the screen it was crooked, random, hackneyed and pretty much any other stereotypical negative adjectives that you might find out to describe a very bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in large, large doses, you may enjoy the movie. However, be prepared to wait. For all those melodramas, this thing is surely at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script should sound very different if the actors concerned read it for themselves. It simply doesn't work as soon as they get around to delivering it to the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB makes us a great disservice, sometimes, when using its goofy computer controlled "weighted count". The curse of the starvation class earns less than a 1. <br /> <br /> Character-driven fiction is great, but if you develop your characters simply by pushing them through hoops without any probable explanation for their maturity or evolution, it is not a character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development. It's a plot. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least, see how it muted. Perhaps you will get some entertainment from all the arms the characters do. <br /> <br /> Oh, and word to the wise - to prove that it's really an artificial film, you see James Woods in everyone his dangly male "look-at-me, I'm the-figurative- and literal-representation-of-the-naked vulnerability-of-man "glory. <br /> <br /> Don't say you're not warned.
