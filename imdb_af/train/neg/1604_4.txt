Remember a movie you've seen in the past that doesn't meet the same feelings as an adult? This happened to me when I went back to school. The National Lampoon's Class Reunion. The movie has a perfect opportunity to laugh, but surprisingly surprised as we see a bizarre collection of characters like a woman who sold her soul to the devil and flames flames from her mouth, a man who is a vampire . , and an ugly killer dressed as a woman and carrying bags over his head. You have the class president who believes he is the best thing since sliced ​​bread (but as we see in the movie, he is a coward and joke), some potrokers who do not even know they are in their own class reunion. A man named Gary who knows, even existed (and no one can remember his name. This is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a turbulent perversion who wants to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a scream when she calls her dog, and the cook (you know her "Goonies" and "Throw Mama From The train "). Who likes to put food on people's plates with her hands! The movie is basically a swamp that takes revenge on its classmates (or at least tries to) revenge for a gag they've pulled on him (they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the murderer who obscured obsolete, dilapidated corridors of the old high school. They were told by the murderer of the killer who looked a little strange. The movie has some good gags that work (pretty much early), but the movie is getting worse every time. The movie's real problem is that it really doesn't know where to go. The movie is pretty much a one-joke point of departure for it has a safe direction .. if it really has any direction. The movie is enthusiastic enough, but the stuff they make funny doesn't have the quality to care about. It is a curio for fans of the early 80's comedy relics that are forgotten (this one is so legal).
