Rockster John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) changes singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight singer. Esther's star rises while John's goes into decline, using drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH weed-on-the-desert highway thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, Evergreen. Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an emerging star if she's already a star. The first time she appeared, she sang in a backstay bar, she looked like an established singer who was slumbering for the night, not like an unknown one struggling to start her singing career. She is too confident, too professional. Her flat looks like a 'flat living' page, not a hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer will live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like ... well, like a singer trying to be an actor but not having many actors. The direction is lukewarm, the story is slow and dull. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting or the lame direction or the slow story. It's the hair! After looking at Kristofferson and Streisand's horrible 70's hairdressers after 2+ hours, your eyes were hurt.
