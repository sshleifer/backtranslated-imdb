But this movie was a drill. The history part was good, but the musical part was not. Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack heard. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus "is supposed to be comic relief, it never works. If John Adams is supposed to be the unpleasantly annoying one, the rest of them are trying to overturn him in every scene <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only portable characters in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The historical quotes and the debate on slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical. <br /> <br /> Do not broom the songs to a musical, except for a few chirps, nothing else was worth the breath.
