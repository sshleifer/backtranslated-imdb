I will not go and give me my 10 bucks I have bought and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can worry about what they see without me. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather look the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy, in the fact that she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy Duke. She can't wear those shorts at all. And since when is American Pie doing something about the Dukes SHAME ON them to put that nasty line over there about sex with a car. This in itself had to get the movie an R rating. The only good thing that can come from this is a reunion movie with the original. Let's hope. So the people out there who went out and saw the movie will see how it should be watched
