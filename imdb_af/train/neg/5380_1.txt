When writing this review, it appears that more than 50% of IMDb voters have given this movie a score of 10 or 1. I can only suspect that those who gave it were either either a crew member or a crew member. <br /> <br /> They say that enough monkeys and plenty of time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, just by random keyboards, will eventually make up Shakespeare's complete works. However, I seriously doubt that the same number of monkeys and time is given, but you can find a single one to give this movie a score of 10. <br /> <br /> I patiently watched the first half, foolishly assuming that the film will at some level develop the plot or characters, or perhaps make some sort of social commentary or scarcely elicit intellectual thinking. Failing that, I was pretty much prepared to accept action, excitement, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way to keep my attention. Eventually, I was disappointed and so much of the second half was considered double-edged, as I sought in vain for a small piece of film redemption. Unfortunately, no one was there. <br /> <br /> When "The Choke" is placed against a Scooby Doo episode, I'm afraid the cartoon will win hands in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various role-players varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassing arm with Brooke Bailey's depiction of the freaky, death-controlled pseudo-goth, London, who was so bad, I felt almost sorry for her. <br /> <br /> I'd like to be on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second class festival of contemporary punk rock, hasn't even entertained, let alone a very weak improve movie.
