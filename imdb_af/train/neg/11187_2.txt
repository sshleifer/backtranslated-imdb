The commands of fatal errors - besides an asinine plot - are that the character simply doesn't resonate or even reacts. <br /> <br /> Two examples: A late-night pastor running through a cemetery is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits. After fighting them, he quietly resumed his walk when his girlfriend emerged. "Anything wrong?" His friend asked him to see the attack. "Just a few demonic spirits - nothing I couldn't handle." No response, no surprise, just as he changed a band. His mate is equally uncomfortable ... must be the standard priest training ... ["And then you put the waffle in their mouth. Any questions? Ok, move on, Demon Spirit attacks ..."] <br /> <br /> Example two: At one stage, the priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something being cared for) can provide it. How? Why, you have to ask a dying man! So the devil has a random person hanging in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thirsty, gay man. "Hey, don't kill him!" or maybe "It's not nice!" would have been more realistic than their response. They never ask them to let the man go or stop; in fact, the closest to the response they get is light annoyance. They asked their question and went. <br /> <br /> I had to break it down - my brain started breaking down. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star from four) <br /> <br />
