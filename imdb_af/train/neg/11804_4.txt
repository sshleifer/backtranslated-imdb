This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good stuff. Lee J. Cobb makes a great Barton Keyes. He is not as good as Edward G. Robinson, but he is the only reason to see it. This remake's only improvement in the original is that it cuts off the role of Lola Dietrichson, the stepdaughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> That's for the good stuff. <br /> <br /> The bad things are a lot. The director records everything in an indifferent way: if you mute the movie, you will hardly get the impression that something special is happening. Because of the modern bad taste, the film should be in color instead of black and white. Due to the bad taste of 1970, all sets are distractingly ugly. Walter Neff's expensive apartment is particularly frightening. <br /> <br /> The modern environment has hurt many small ways. Train rides were a little more unusual in the 70's than in the 40's, so Mr. Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of a controversy. Men stopped wearing hats, which prevent Walter from covering his brown hair while he with the mare. Dietrichson constitutes. Women in mourning stopped wearing veils, which Samantha Eggar robbed of a prop, Barbara Stanwyck made use of in an important scene. (Remember, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she needed it.) <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco loves Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler -the same. But he made very small, inexplicable changes to the dialogue leaving the writing slightly flabby as soon as it was leaning and muscular. Disgracefully, the famous motorcycle policeman is gone, but look carefully and you will see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. Bochco should not blame. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is acceptable as Walter Neff. What may have made this version tolerable is a wonderful Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes out as a standard issue villain of "Barnaby Jones." But who can blame Egg? With a director scarcely interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck have done herself well?
