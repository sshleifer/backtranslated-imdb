I am, like many, a fan of Tony Scott movies. When this movie came out, I had great hope that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie is the farthest thing! The story was getting water, and Mickey Rourke's choice was not such a good idea. And the whole poor scene was too free! <br /> <br /> The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie shows she'll never be a movie star! The movie has brought some of the worst acting ever. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's direction all but it takes the whole Friggin cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!
