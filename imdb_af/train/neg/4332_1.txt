This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel. The one thing that people have forgotten is the fact that the reason why the original such award won was strictly adhered to the fact that you had to make yourself feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the laundry. I'm not a negative type of guy, but the man who is acting in this movie .... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I am sorry that I had two hours of my time and my money was wasted on this movie. I still love the original and will do my best not to ruin this movie.
