As someone who likes acting and was really busy with this fascinating life story, I was optimistic about this movie, but too many stumbling blocks have overcome the good story it should have been. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he played, but his role here is a dull one as insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is insipid and the beautiful Kathryn Harrold is real rubbish mouth. From what I read, there were several directors replacing each other on this movie, and it's too bad. You can say things aren't right with the story. I couldn't get involved with Beyers Williams' performance of Cooper. He had to be fascinating, but he wasn't in this movie. It is also kind of a sad remark that a man who commits a crime is a kind of "folk hero", but I admit that I have also rooted for the man. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can't complain about the scenery, from the green, green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I would like to see and improve this movie again as it is a one-of-a-kind story.
