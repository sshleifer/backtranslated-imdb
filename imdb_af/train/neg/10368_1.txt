This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing even seems to be and is realistic. Plot is weak, acting - miserable, actors looking around as in a 1st year production, trying very hard to finish without any chance from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort for everyone involved, including the audience. Well, as in any excitement, here are also murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone who has a knife with a knife 5 minutes ago and came out quietly and smiling, not to speak clean as a whistle, as if one's throat is being done by a virtual agent. This murder also had to be done by a small fragile woman on a tall strong man, and she cut his throat !!! Did she politely ask him to bow to her? There is a lot more stupidity of the same kind going on and on leaving the audience wondering if it means it's a joke that just became a bad one. Continuity is another big problem, for example: The eager, hungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virgin to come out of the bathroom and has been asleep for a long time. The next scene begins with the young couple entering the reception area, and asks for guidance on scenic spots! Not a word last night ??? Such a waste of time, even trying to write about this low-low supposed film.
