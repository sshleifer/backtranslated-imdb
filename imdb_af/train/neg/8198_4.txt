Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or do every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico sucks. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with touch, mixed with all the stuff on the beach, the Andromeda tribe, the classroom scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a small Stargate to start. <br /> <br /> Derivatives do not even begin to describe this movie. Of course, with nothing original plot showing, do they strengthen the gore and sex right? Nope Gore is a wink and you miss it and sex is all plague. (James Spader says he needs a shower and delicious Leslie Stefanson asks him to join him.) He turned her off. AGGH!) In fact, if a movie ever needs a shower to live things This is it. I mean, if you are going to turn around beautiful women in white bathing suits around an Antarctic research base, why not break. <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of real excitement in the whole movie Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slow for a sci-fi adventure. Need to rotate a much better plot to educate it and, incidentally, the Alien itself is a terrible clich√© art and has virtually no screen time for anyone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked to see what is with the Children of the Wheat in the space motif. (Note that since Jason's 13th fame, Pinhead of Hellraiser and the Leprechaun have traveled all day to travel to space to kill nubious teenagers, why not the wheat field?) The characters in the limelight like Logan's Run extras and I just waited on the stems to get alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> It would have been exciting and apparently against this movie covenant. The acting is mostly fine because Spader gives his Stargate role, while Stefanson and Janine Eser are the latest in Antarctic beachwear model. However, John Lynch reads the entire script and acts like the bad guy, before the story shows it. Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me feel like a proper kid of the grain in Space movie.
