This movie sucked. The play sucked, the writing sucked and the movie sucked. There were two wires in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a little work to find out what had happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's got to be spelled out, but suddenly you get things done and are said to have the slightest idea of ​​what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> The heroine's negative comment on the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows something about the man and how he is tied up in her fiancé's death. The viewer also has minimal exposure to the man's death. <br /> <br /> Suddenly there is a scene with a lot of guys uploading and hooking machine gun and that's all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation about the guns and the people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel we wanted our time back. It was nice to visit the movie while we watched it, and it gave us at least some entertainment. ;-)
