I start with what I wanted. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything about them was fantastic, the costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, everything <br /> <br /> I have love the crab scene and the cuisine. <br /> <br /> But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I get it, arty theater, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing and moaning from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it would be !), too many pornographic scenes (I really get it, I get that they filmed a porn movie there, but really, really, really it's too much) I really think the theater should be to watch and this one is definitely not following the right way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
