A friend of mine lent me this video and I was pretty excited to see it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfield's slow fever and Lars holding on to his drum, I began to think, "Why am I watching that? "That question goes through your mind in 5 - 10 minutes after you hit Play. I returned the tape on the same day, as you would suspect, not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
