Lesson visitor, the first film about the medieval travelers was actually funny. I love Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course ordinary absurdity, which would remind you of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel travels the same characters, same actors in big parts and the same time. The plot changes a bit, as the characters are now supposed to experience travelers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying attention to the fact that it is still becoming absurd as you go into the movie. The Duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing with his game, but his character is empty, so there's not much he can do to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, the duke's slave / helper, he really has all the attention. The movie is just about him and she is clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he might be. Fact is; This character tries to produce the laughter of the audience, but he does not succeed. It's as if someone is telling you a very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling the joke to the end and adding details to make your suffering a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you love Les Visitor, don't spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did not have a Lesson Visitor, you would never see the successor. If you like this sequel ... well, I suppose you should still see a lot of movies.
