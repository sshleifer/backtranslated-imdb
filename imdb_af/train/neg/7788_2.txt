I noticed how all the other reviews of this movie call it "healthy" and "entertaining" it. These people should come out of the house more often. I don't know why they are shilling for this vapid, unceasing, brainless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and his ignorance is only exceeded by that of his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to ban the treacherous practice of making talented models in an unsuspecting public, an error habit that unfortunately continues to this day). A good supporting role player (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) is trying to make it difficult to make sense of it, but it doesn't matter. I noticed that two directors shared credit, although "credit" was not the word I would use (also "director"). As for "healthy entertainment", many of those movies are available without interfering with your loved ones by forcing them to sit down. Find one of those movies and save this one.
