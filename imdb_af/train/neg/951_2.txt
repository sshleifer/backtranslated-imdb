*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> If LIFE ON TOKYO TIME was, there was a bold print where actress role-players had to be given movie parts provided they were required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety , anti-depression and anti-psychotic medication (this is the classic soul-quarter combination that patients let go of zombies) during filming, then this movie will be much more interested. Or, if the film production was another kind of experiment where all the actors were sleeping before and during the filming, TOKYO TIME could be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As it is, this movie is filled with lifeless, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new man sat on the stairs and chatted with his sister, it seems he is having trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene, he speaks his lines, moving with every part of his body motionless. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as "near sleep." <br /> <br /> Don't worry about the actors talking about each other's lines, as these actors can hardly complete a dialogue. Everyone talks with a depressing, monotonous voice. No laughter. No shouting. No power. No one has enough energy to crack a smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help that direction is simple and amateur. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at all costs. Better to see GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese novel, look at the long vacation that has a great deal of everything. LIFE ON TOKYO TIME, not.
