I'm sure there's a kind of IMDB cult that likes movies that made MST3K fun. Having seen both of these and "Werewolf" and making dozens of comments on how underestimated they are, I was convinced that there was some conspiracy here. Many people say that people who hate it are "just afraid of gore", "Don't know good horror" or things like that. Well, I don't really care about gore, but I want to do something in a movie! Most of it is just the woman sitting and looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! A movie requires something to give the atmosphere, you don't get it by just having senseless scenes where someone is walking around and staring. Oh, and "do you think"? Yes, I thought "move! You @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever had! <br /> <br /> P. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, that kind of stuff.
