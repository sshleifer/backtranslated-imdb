My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll go with it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie was like an exaggerated soap opera, and it's about everything I can comment on. There were some interesting scenes, like the "Big One" that hit the middle of the movie, but wait, what is it? The earthquake * is waiting *, wait a moment! It's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it slaughtered and collapsed. I can't believe how poor this movie was, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better movies. One wonders what director thought the viewers are stupid enough to believe that great bushy mountainous backgrounds exist in downtown LA, Ala Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget the Bond Wil Nash, in this movie. and go for the right thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak by chance.) <br /> <br />
