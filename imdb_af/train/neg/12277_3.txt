I found the "Arab conspiracy" in a bargain and thought I had uncovered a lost treasure. People, there's a reason you don't hear much about this movie. The plot is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is about as lively as ordinary, cold tofu, and the end leaves you flat. Not even Sean Connery can save this one.
