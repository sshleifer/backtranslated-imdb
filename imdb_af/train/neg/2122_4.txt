Although Seven Pounds in some aspects are solid and interesting in some of his narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is fairly mediocre. The movie becomes more and more juicy and manipulative as it moves to the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physically and metaphorically. Seven pounds is more of an amateur imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with many and many flashbacks. The problem is the story is very predictable from VERY easy through the movie. It's too bad, because seven pounds could have been so "authentic" if Ben and Emily were in the right hands.
