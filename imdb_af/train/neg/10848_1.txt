It can be an interesting movie on all accounts. With a score of the mighty Cradle Of Filth, with their leading Dani in the prospect and "the future of British horror", I expected Alex Chandon's gore festival to lead the hype. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is either cliche or infinite. The short story anthology setup was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. The idea of ​​the sick room, though, has allowed my spine to cool down, but as with most of the movies, it was frightened by bad writing and acting. <br /> <br /> Chandon can't write dialogue. Every sentence with the chief police investigator is full of curse and insolvency (the typical cop on the edge formula. Funny, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino . . Or Scorsese. It sounds BAD. Add impeccably OTT with a lot of dodgy casting (don't misunderstand me, Dani Filth is a good singer and musician, but the actor is not him) and the performances are quite ridiculous for the ear that is shocking. Give me Bruce Campbell some day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are on the poor, with some horrific CGI, horrible gore effects. (For the good, Peter Jackson did better and it was more than ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters that screaming OVERALL! As for the often abused use of Cradle Of Filth's score ... man, they have to sue. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build atmosphere and encouraging terror and repulsion within its audience. Too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do so much better with far better gore effects (eg maniac, zombie carnivores, others, suspiria, etc.), what Cradle or Fear, in me thoughts, second-rate and aging. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn about this horrible ghoul of a movie and continue to make a quality scare that actually scares. <br /> <br /> Congratulations next time.
