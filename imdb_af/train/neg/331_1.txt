I can no doubt say that Going Overboard is the only worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I saw Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a boat. That's the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's all about the place like a crazy man's breakfast, and not similar in a wacky naked gun, but more frustrating, throwing both shoes in the way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, without reason I can understand it (it was certainly not for humor). Add to the mixture Miss. Australia, which has the worst Australian accent I have ever heard, and you have something I won't call the worst movie ever made. To go overboard does not even fit the basic definition of a movie. I strongly recommend seeing this movie as it will elevate the status of every bad movie you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you will say after watching a bad movie, it will be "at least it wasn't as bad as going overboard".
