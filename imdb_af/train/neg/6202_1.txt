I've been watching the movie to the shameful end, though I felt so angry about what I saw. I felt the director was shouting for attention and the only way he could reach it was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I lived in the UK, I loved this country, but this film shows British youngsters in the worst possible way. There is nothing to be said, but avoid it, it makes you angry and sick. The people involved must be ashamed.
