I read Tom Robbins, Even Fever gets the blue one as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I couldn't believe what a dull, sour, joyful piece of junk was. How did it happen? I think someone in Hollywood is reading this book and filing it under "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS." (This is the subject of the Library of Congress.) Anything over 12 reading the book will know that it has nothing to do with real lesbians. More than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was, of course - and I mean mostly - written by a heterosexual man who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time) but has never met one. <br /> <br /> Still, someone in Hollywood said, "oh, better give it to a Gay director or Gay People will make trouble." So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but - but Gay he may really be - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant has a straight man's playful fantasy of debt-free girl / girl action and male voyeurism has it in a dull, literally meaningful Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like changing an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty. <br /> <br /> The main idea that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the turbulent bad casting. His safe allowed him to rent the very best. His ignorance of the novel's true subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster) caused him to make choices that were not only bad but bizarre. <br /> <br /> Let's meet the role play of OWN COOLING BREAKS. THE FLOWER. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Well, there are few name recognition Asian actors. And Pat Morita, in happy days, was pretty funny. But definitely if the CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't tell him.) Pat doesn't look like the Chink either. . . Well, SEXY !!! In the book he is not old, Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He is a rickety old buck and he knows a lot about the enjoyable and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book they're not LOTS of lesbians. Do you realize it's a straight man's fantasy?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT "THE COUNTESS" Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he is a serious, SHAKESPEAREANE ACTOR !!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be thrown as a goofy man like the Countess is tragic and sad. I expected Paul Scofield to wander in all the robes like Thomas More and his head with his head. "Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul completely. For shame, my former student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) like Caligula. But it was BLACK humor, not playful and lazy humor like the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean." No talent, no training, no problem. Except that the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the movie she is dumb, passive, expressionless and boring. As for her taste for women, Robbins puts it like that in the book. "God knows I love women, but nothing can fit the place of a man who fits." Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw." This is a difficult role. In the book, Sissy is really an unusual passive and crooked heroine. Still, a more perfect actress can have made a glance in her eye, or a swing in her, to create some sort of hidden power or hidden pleasure from her adventures. Uma doesn't pull it out, probably because Gus never told her, Sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumb. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is sour and boring. And I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
