If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she's a real, mean, cruel girl, watching Amy Adams she's just a little fool hanging around. She's nothing! People do not encourage her! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and warm in the first movie, now he is "baby face". Story is not so good, and I do not understand. Why didn't they even make this one, that's the beginning. Release actors, nothing with story. It's not cruel, it plays. The first one has better actors, better story, and she's in common. I think the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions. 3. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but compared to the first one, it's one big, big, big nothing.
