A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. When I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adjustment measured. Unfortunately, the movie does not even close the creation of the atmosphere or the development of the characters Orwell has done so masterfully in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie read the book because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters feel and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is crazy all the way through and hardly does any acting to the end. We never really get what he does for life, or why his love affair is forbidden, or the political climate, and why the main character desires rebellion. This book cannot be done justice in film form without proper narration and explanation of the political system that suppresses the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the biggest shortcoming of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a terribly decisive choice, which was about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he was supposed to portray. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast is well chosen. It's just bad they've been put in the wrong main actor in such a terribly customized movie. -Brian O.
