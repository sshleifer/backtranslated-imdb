Will anyone really see this RUBBISH if it doesn't contain small children running naked? From a kinematic point of view, this is probably one of the worst movies I have totally stunned. Some perv woke up one day and thought I'd make a movie with little ones and call it art, keep them in the countryside and there was no need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they didn't appear to Nowhere to live or have parents, because p * rn movies don't have to have such a thing. I will comment on the rest of the film, but I have not chosen spoilers, so I will just say avoid, avoid avoiding and find yourself a proper movie to watch
