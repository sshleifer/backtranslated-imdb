Okay, I tried and I tried, but I won't find this Guy Maddin thing. Stories From the Gimli Hospital, I stayed cold, the movie about the Austrian villagers and one over the ice was nice to look at, but lacking in the story section ... and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm glad Maddin appreciates silent movie, but I don't like his movies for the same reason. I don't like the movies of Quentin Tarantino: they are empty tributes to better, more imaginative films - films that have progressed or broken. new ground - and are all style and no dust. No number of jumping clues and strange camera angles can hide the fact that Maddin is an original David Lynch wannabe, although he has ONE advantage over Tarantino: he generally does not write an embarrassment to dialogue because most of his films are on intertitles rely. The bottom line is, Maddin's sktick is cleverly clever film-making for aspiring movie majors.
