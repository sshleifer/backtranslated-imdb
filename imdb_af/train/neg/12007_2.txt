It's amazing to see Nikhil Advani getting people to the theater until the day of release. I mean ..... look at the cast here, the promotion is great, good enough songs and the trailers are good. It fills the house on the first day, but it is only when people are watching and the film realizes that there is no way to repay their money. House full of the first day, the movie is out next week. <br /> <br /> Inspired by 'Love Actually', this movie has failed to handle the whole game well. They were trying to put in big stars, but in the end they even failed to bring even an average performance to anyone. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience cannot be associated with any of them. This is a huge disappointment for anyone who likes big stars or Nikhil Advani after his great success of 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
