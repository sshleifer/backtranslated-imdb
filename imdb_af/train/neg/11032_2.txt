"I love New York" is another entry by VH-1 (MTV Networks) that shows the entertaining side of dating a shrill, unpleasant woman. It had to be an easy decision to take the wildest, Ebonics-speaking, craziest participant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "this is a show". It's not as bad as the previous show, "Flavor of Love", but it's just as bad. It reminds me of a shave from the 90's show "In Living Color" where Keenan Ivory Wayans was the boxer Mike Tyson mimicked on the "The Love Connection" dating show and he chose "Robin Givens" for a date. Mike talked about how the date was good, but how the silly mother had failed. This show reminds me. <br /> <br /> The men are chosen and given names to decay themselves and the woman they date more - (I would think an intelligent man to date, an intelligent woman will NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you will hurt yourself every time you appear on TV. professional reality actors, so why bother. <br /> <br /> It escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all these things. The fact that it is so false as her newly implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising time for the network? (Well, you can't hate them trying to make a goat.) Perhaps the miracle - who wants to be an hour with this woman? Or wonder if she and her mother's next show will be on the WWF! Anyway you cut, it's a train wreck you've already seen before. So now the shock value is zero. <br /> <br /> No turning or turning will make it a more interesting train wreck, or any difference from any of the others. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and to those who call an 'end' to reality shows are just another nail in the coffin why they should end immediately.
