Slashers ..... Well, if you like horrors, it's definitely one to see, otherwise it doesn't even get it. It is quite clear that this film has a very low budget. For example, it looks as if the entire movie was shot in a warehouse somewhere, and on several occasions you see the mike tree shade and the camera is shaded, trust me you don't need to look for them. Also, try to ignore the cute actors, if that's what you call them! a few people have decided to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze because they are three murderers and everyone who lives at the end becomes rich. Now there's something about this movie that makes you look and rarely find it with a cheap budget horror these days. For example, when I looked at it, I thought of myself, I wouldn't mind having a breeze! especially for $ 12,000,000. So anyway, I would recommend you look at it and make your own mind.
