Clearly, the well-known 1950s show Misty Ayers acting talents. She couldn't act too badly. <br /> <br /> Drilling a little story about sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) is being stunned and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets nice Tommy Cole who immediately falls in love with her. He wants to help her escape, but can he? You really won't mind. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers just cuts her underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story, shockingly bad acting, horrible "comedy" (never thought prostitution was funny, but what do I know?) And terrible dialogue. I admit there was a twist to the end I didn't see, but that's not enough to put it through. Also Ayers's attempt at acting is hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
