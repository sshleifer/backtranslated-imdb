I bought this video, pretty cheap, and thought the cover looked pretty pretty. And it was nice, but the movie is trash. I can handle B degrees, sometimes I even enjoy a good B skirt (ie 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how the genre can be entertained), but it was just a mere mix. Incredibly dull scenes are too sparse due to good, healthy cheap pornography and entertaining dream desires. This movie has very little to offer.
