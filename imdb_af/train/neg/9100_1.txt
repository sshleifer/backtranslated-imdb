Christ, O Christ! One looks amazed, unbelievable, and possibly disrupted, as this turbulent exercise unfolds unfailingly with all the wit and agility of a Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist or was I the illegal guinea pig of a shady international drug company unaware of my coffee being spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I saw many movies, and many bad movies, but nothing prepared me for this; By the end, I was a spooky wreck which tore my teeth against the carpet, like a dog clinging to the walls and crying to my lungs. I desperately pleaded, ruthless for mercy (to whom this appeal was made, I do not know), and longed for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro with a burning desire. Sweet Weeping Jesus, the memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable, I can handle them the least. I cry, I tear down tears, I bite my fingernails until my hands are smeared with blood, but I can't provoke the terrible flashbacks of my mind. I'm ghost. I'm damaged. I'm a man's shell. <br /> <br /> The other user comment here suggests that I am not alone in undergoing this scary experience, which could mean just one of two things: a) doing the movie, actually, or b) I is just one victim of legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister relationships. What is particularly staggering is that some people have enjoyed their trial, or at least not been traumatized by it. Maybe they're part of the operation. God damned them, the maniacs! God damn them all to hell !!!!!!
