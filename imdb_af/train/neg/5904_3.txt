With the runaway success of God's army, it looks as if every Mormon with a camera is trying to make a movie. In the case of the recent "The Other Side of Heaven" it was not a bad thing at all. The movie, though not large, was pretty good. "The Singles Ward" is not. <br /> <br /> The story of a young, divorced Mormon man returned to the single life, the writing and shooting style of The Singles Ward is in many ways, much like the 80's comedy "Ferris Bueller's Day Off ". However, the agreements end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original and well done (as far as stupid comedies like this ever), "The Singles Ward" is quite the opposite. It's trying very hard to be funny. But 90% of the gags also fall flat or are clich√©s and jokes that you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seems to have been thrown in to fill in the time. And the play, while not terrible, is at best amaturish. <br /> <br /> Also, if you are not a Mormon yourself, or very, very familiar with the Mormon culture, you get nothing at all. While "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appeal to a wide variety of viewers, inside and outside the Mormon Church, this movie is definitely one big inside joke, and even if you get it, It's just not that funny.
