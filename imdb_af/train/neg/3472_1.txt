James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what ever he took in this piece of unfriendly rubbish. Affleck is just a lightweight that just can't cut it, the rest of the cast is truly memorable. I saw it in the US in an empty theater, I soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I came out before the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I was back in England, I saw the movie has a glowing report from "Paul Ross" in one of the discount markets Sundays. I always trust Ross to save my money on cinema cards, if he says the movie is good, I get straight to this site to check it out. This movie had to go straight to Â£ 1.99 in a supermarket near you.
