I watched the list of movies by Richard Burton when I came to this title, which I recall seeing for the first time in 1982 on the cable. I remember Tatum O'Neal's dialogue, which was just incredibly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character who looks so lost and remembers how his motivation didn't translate for me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so phenomenally awful. <br /> <br /> This movie came out when America made a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed teenage sexuality. Remember "The Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other teen-only films, especially with adults. As a teenager at this time, I got the obsession, combined with the sexual offenses of the 70s and 80s, made for an unconscious disturbing environment to portray it all. <br /> <br /> "Circle of Two" was not improperly acted or unnecessarily excited, such as "Blue Lagoon". In fact, the problem of love between the young and the old in a brave, if completely failed, way. But honestly, this is one of those movies you will never have to see if you haven't seen it on its first run, because it was so terrible. No one would want this garbage ever to be widely distributed.
