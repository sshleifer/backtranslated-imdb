"Don't drink the water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on a 1966 Broadway game by Woody Allen. This is Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind "The Honeymooners". The director, Howard Morris, appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Angst, Silent Movie) and made a brand in animation. He also named Gopher of Pooh, Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey. What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is being played too seriously to work effectively. Allen's original play was tongue-in-cheek, so it worked on Broadway and in Allen's 1994 remake. The script by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock kill the premise and make too many changes to the original play. To make Gleason's wife a pilot in this version when she was a head woman in the original is just one example of why it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The acting isn't much better. Gleason does the best with the material, but he can't save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a good actor as he demonstrated in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His scabby personality could have worked here, but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance. Sorry. Estelle Parsons will head to your nuts after 20 minutes. See how soon it will take YOU to strangle her. It is also a shame because she is also a good actress. He has two exceptional performances in Bonnie and Clyde and Rachel, Rachel. Neither of the other actors did exceptionally well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this movie so much that he made the movie in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the clues. They manage to make all the right notes and the movie itself is a comic masterpiece. This is finally on video after a long battle over rights. Go out and find the version. All the original 1969 is good for cleaning up unwanted guests who welcome them. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 stars
