This game has the honor of being the first game I stopped playing in the middle, and I felt like breaking into pieces and then burning. Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I'll ever play, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: Just the word tik made me laugh. There is none. There is also no character development. We finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself, who is not a beep * mary-sue, but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast is big. They had to attract the sexist boy gamers you see. Anyway, everything she does goes into the grave after the grave shoots as she goes. Why she does, I have no idea. I had subtitles and that as hard as I could and I still didn't understand a damn thing. The development (or lack of it) for her, her two friends and the * villains * was laughing. There will also be levels you have to do - don't give an indication of what to do now and you'll be literally in most of the boring as graves for HOURS to try and find out what hell you're supposed to do . There is one course (out of two) in particular with her on a motorcycle (believe me it's not fun) that you will be an hour with no savings in sight for an hour. This means you are hit by other motorists and guys, who shoot in trucks, or hit a tree where you pull the hour. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know we make the levels very long, basically have no savings points, no story, no character development, no spell difference, most of the music on the longest levels is booming and give no tips whatsoever to the player so they can stay longer in a place instead of coming to the non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: This sounds like ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or unplayed game play. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry sir, but these ideas seem to kick off a lot. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut up Todd. You were fired. <br /> <br /> Game: All she does is shoot. Of course she can flip while shooting, jumping while shooting, or kicking while shooting again. But to jump, jump, and kick, do not erase the fact that everything she eventually does is shoot. BORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The intro music is extremely beautiful. I like to listen to this. That play music goes from the tolerance to cutting off your ears. Visas: Since this game was made in 2006, I expected the footage to blow me away. Well, I was blown, but certainly not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This game is a plot less, no character development messed with a scantily dressed unmarysuish (THANKFULLY) starring young women going through boring graves for some boring reason (what it could be, I can't tell you) with unimaginable shooting game. Stay far away from this B.S. !!!!!!!! It gets two stars to have a woman who is not a girl in need (no matter how skinny she is) and the beautiful music.
