I wish I could say that this show was uncommon in banality, but it is usually in every way. It has the stupid man, his smarter but boring and conventional woman, along with the idiotic sidekick for 'comic' relief. it. Strong predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the lag track, break out these obnoxious, impressive plot lines of these harmful mental anesthetics to leave me physically ill or in a deep sleep that looks more like an induced coma. But it may be for a while, because it gives the average American a person who can really identify them. An "ordinary" guy like you and me. I live in the south of the US, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. Hereafter, the stupid character is everywhere, in one form or another. Sometimes he is a cruel leftover on television.
