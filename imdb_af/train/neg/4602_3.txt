A movie without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double him. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the dead man's wife, and without her knowing he is the killer, she moves along. Then he accidentally killed her when she found out. Then, in a WALKING TAL kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the gangsters who crossed him twice. The first problem is that the drifter loses all sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism by accepting the hiring murder. We cannot accept goodness in him and as a result the rest of the no moral center. We just can't mind that kind of guy. And the woman (played well by Kari Wuhrer, the sheriff in REVERSED FREAKS), a high-class lady who runs a mission for homeless people, also loses some sympathy by jumping straight into bed with the homeless driver ( despite her seemingly impaired condition after her husband's death). And if she finds out, is he the man? what is she doing? She locks him inside her house (as if ALL houses have closed, you can't open from inside) and continue to talk to him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is immensely in a role as a beefy thief. Director Stuart Gordon did so much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
