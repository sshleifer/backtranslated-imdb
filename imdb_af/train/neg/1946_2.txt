As a mother of 2 young children I have to or should I have grown up with the many reincarnations of Scooby, I feel well positioned to comment on the historic and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> As a family We didn't see any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby get an idea, we might have enjoyed it as a lightweight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But this is essentially the problem, it is so lightweight in the current format that it will not have the lifetime of the "old" Scooby and gang. I'm sure it can succeed in a quick monetary return, but I'm sure the long-term buy is young and old in a very real danger of being lost. My 6-year-old son to see the new version was really unhappy and said without a clue that it looks really bad animated and why wasn't it like the last series (where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than that. Let's hope Get an idea about the producers.
