I would first like to say that I am a republican, although I disagree with many of the things that bush in the office did. And I love the daily show and Colbert report. They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the bush jokes at Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest man ever to walk the earth (I also believe he is not the stupid one.) But it comes to a point when Enough enough and not really that funny. I see where it can be funny and it is (hey he makes fun of our authority figure he is hilarious.). Comedy central, but just try hard to make fun of him. Maybe I mean one special episode, but a whole series is just stupid. It looks as if CC are just saying the same bush jokes that we heard many times on WAY. I really can't see this show going past 1 season.
