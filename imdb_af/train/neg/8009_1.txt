In the lost boy, a private eye looking for a missing man stumbles on a child prostitution ring. This movie contains all the worst stereotypes you can think of in a worst-case scenario that only exists in the minds of Hollywood, the press and AG John Asscrap. If you get the chance to see it, you'll be better off losing yourself.
