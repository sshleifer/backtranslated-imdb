I don't get it. Of course, the movie has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has good pacing, good editing and pretty good directing. Then WHY, WHY, Why didn't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it wouldn't be so cute and WHY, WHY, why they hired such turbulent actors who can't get out of a paper bag do not act? This movie could have been good. In most cases it looks good and feels good, but in the end you realize that the movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I'd say it's a good production, but a bad movie. Actually, really. <br /> <br /> Anyway? Come one, really!
