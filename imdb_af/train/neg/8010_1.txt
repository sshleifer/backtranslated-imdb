I am very surprised at the positive comments because there were four of us who saw it on one screen and we all walked out. We personally felt it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to keep it. In particular, those in the group who really wanted it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation, did not keep or identify alienation in the school years that were portrayed. : <br /> <br /> It is said, it is wonderful to see that this film is very resonant with many people here on the boards and with judges. This is the beauty of the subjective art form of film. :)
