This show made me feel physically ill and completely detached from British society as a whole. These were programs like this and Blue Peter who pretended that there were no class divisions in Britain. They will always like things; "Go into your cage and you can find it." Or "go in your backyard tonight and ..." - which of our "scummy" working class children who have never had a "cage" and a "backyard" What was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block? Public service broadcasting - yes right! And, moreover, it was very depressed to see those stupid, middle-class, on-their-own kids, messing with bits of old plastic that had "fun." Do me a favor, and "why not" you will tear your wrists or make an overdose on "mama and dad's" money ... you make me sick
