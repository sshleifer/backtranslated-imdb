That's right, you've heard me, this movie is a freaking 'ABOMINATION. First, the band, who is going to see hell or listen to a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name terrible, but also the musicians, they can't even play anything! Also, the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is terrible! Not only are they terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Guided by a crappy director and thin plot, it has to be the stupid movie ever. I wish this site will allow you to run a voice from NOW or UNDER 10. Because this filth is 1/10, it's too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call it. a comedy movie. If you are looking for comedy with music, go to that "Weird Al" Yankovic guy because he does it much better than these undisputed tweens.
