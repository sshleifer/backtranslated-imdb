SAKURA KILLERS (1+ out of 5 stars) Perhaps in 1987 this movie might have been cool ... if you've never seen a * good * ninja movie. Cheesy '80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy acting ... and past-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is in the beginning ... with an elderly Chuck Connors playing on a beach golf ... several black dressed ninjas are trying to sneak up on him and it seems like he's planning to hit his ball notice ... suddenly he comes into his golf bag and ... naw, I won't spoil it for you. If you ever have the misfortune to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about a stolen video tape or something. A lot of dull glowing heroes are trained in the ways in which the ninja because "just a ninja can fight a ninja or something. Strangely, these guys don't seem to fight better after their training than before. Oh yes, the movie Moving pretty fast The battle scenes may not be great, but they are plentiful ... and the exaggerated sound effects are good for some chuckles.
