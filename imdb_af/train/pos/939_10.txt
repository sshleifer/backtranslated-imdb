Okay, there are a lot of reviews here, what can I possibly add? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll try. <br /> <br /> The reason it is my favorite Scrooge is because of ONLY. The sets, outdoor spaces, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting role was very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and cousin, played by Roger Rees. She understated sincerity and his voice was the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also a completely credible Bob Cratchit. She is a difficult life, but he remains positive and worthy. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his portrayal was too gruff. I couldn't disagree anymore. His exchange at the beginning, while cold or hard, was not out of character. He is a terribly disillusioned man whose heart is hardened by the volatility of life and his own lust for wealth. <br /> <br /> During flashbacks, it's clear he isn't everything. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he was completely gone, his partner, Marley, would never have come first. And after all, we are not one of us beyond hope. I think it's a big part of what Dickens is trying to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance at his employer at Belle, you see him sorry because he tells Belle in the flash that he is going through life "with a smile on my face." Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they are left on the floor of the machining room on the left. <br /> <br /> And finally, his conversion is so full of joy that it makes me cry, tears of joy, every time I see it. His excuse to his cousin Fred, so sincere, so moving, it is not just the spirit of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife, is so clear. And the line that gets me every time, "God forgive me for the time I wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
