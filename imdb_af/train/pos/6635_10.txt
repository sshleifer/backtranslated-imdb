What can I ever say about the first movie? <br /> <br /> You can't judge it because it's not supposed to be entertainment. But if you have to judge it, give it 10. It is wonderful to see moving images from the year 1895. It was one of the most important films in history. I wonder what it was like to be one of the people who ever saw the first movie! <br /> <br />
