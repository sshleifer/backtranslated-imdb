In this small movie we have some great characters, but a very shallow plot. It's actually nice to watch, because Singleton does a good job of presenting the esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This leaves the viewer forgetting the non-existent realism that this movie is supposed to have. In fact, what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes that are higher on cellulose at a rate higher than that of a soap. Definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.
