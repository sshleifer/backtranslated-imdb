This group of English benefits is a pleasure to watch. The supporting role-play can be a series of their own. It is seen before love tiangle between the head of the operation, his wife, and a new beautiful boy operation resident. Just the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene lift it from the trash category to a very pleasant "skirt". The only doubt is that it is difficult to assume that smoldering Francesca Annis will fall in love and that I actually marry Michael Kitchen, who loves me, is almost an international or even a British gender symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green will light her fire, apologizing to the "Doors". The man who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. Look at 'The Way We Live Now', in a completely different show, to get an idea of ​​his series. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometimes sex toys, is hard to forget as the surprised mistress who makes Kitchen, sorry that he has ever looked at her big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, like Green's sidekick surgery friends as I said, may have their own range. They are so good. The whole thing is great fun, and I highly recommend it, and thank you imdbman for paying the paying customers in this fascinating place.
