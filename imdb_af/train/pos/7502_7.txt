Although I felt nothing for Lance's character, and I felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger movie if they spent more time on character development, perhaps with Lance. I would have liked it better. <br /> <br /> However, I must completely agree with DoyleLuver when they said. "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character Ben:" I'm the star in it, that's right, I'm the talented one! "If you watch the movie, just look at him, even if he's in the background ... just his facial expressions, all in the eyes, you definitely know what Ben motivates, exactly how he feels about comments, even if it's a quick look behind a character's back. Great play in a fair movie.
