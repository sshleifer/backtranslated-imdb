I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (was it spelled right?) In Cybil. Seeed her for a while and forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a good job in this. The supporting role was also pretty good. In some corners, the girl looks even like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty sly and the story generally had good twists and turns. The young boyfriend was a hottie. I thought the man definitely had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Just the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. Keep my interest and I'll see it again when they revive it. Can anyone recommend any similar movies? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you like. Thank you in advance. Aboutagirly.
