In the beginning this is one of England, so of course I have 98% chances that it will be intelligent and very good movies. I've never heard of this movie. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I told myself: Oh! Here's the female version of my left foot. I was right, but I was wrong too. Wrong because the two movies are very different. My left foot was a John Ford equal movie and this one is a Chaplin-like movie (not because it's funny, but Chaplin on that great sense of melodrama that brings tears into your eyes.) It was right because in 1990, Daniel Day-Lewis turned a little ugly by playing a disabled person and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing but with many female emotions. The story is well written and it is very intelligent. For me, Bonham-Carter misses one of the biggest women's part of the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Give! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of the theater since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a true talent, as seen on many other movies. See this one, you won't regret it! And also a very good job by Branagh!
