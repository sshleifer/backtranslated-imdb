She is not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful NBA players whose career light is relieved for no good reason other than the timing of their birth. Their names can easily get out of the public's lips like Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Will, the list goes on; But the volume is turned off a bit, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other good players who have always lost the news to Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw Gretchen Mol's career flaming out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 Vanity Fair issue, which was the inevitable superstar for Mrs. Mol predicted. It was later said she was over. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I remember for some time that I would be confused about what actress Mary Ann Lomax was playing after "The Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98. Was this Mol of Theron? Oh yes! Charlize Theron was the one in "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol were in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> By the time I saw the "Thirteenth Floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I really fixed them, but I'm still putting them in the same spiritual file drawer. Both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on. <br /> <br /> However, Theron was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was quite intimidating. <br /> <br /> In 2003, "Monster" was released and from that point on to the transfer of the Oscar itself, all filmed knew who was the "Best Actress" award. And just so! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what the real Aileen Wuornos tick did is to somehow play the digital video in Selby's head. And for a great talent to make herself physically unattractive! Unknown! <br /> <br /> In 2005, the Notorious Bettie Page was released. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she's in the shadow of Ms Theron. It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the loss of presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. It was considered a continuation of an old story. Once a promising actress with a declining career makes a nudge in a B-movie. Ho hum! No no no! Wrong! No matter what you think of the movie (and I enjoy movies over the fifties) if you pass this one, you will miss one of the better achievements of that year. Mrs. Moll was as many Bettie as me. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately, Aileen, for the film audience, is more sympathetic. For whatever reason, an amoral, sociopathic murderer is less embarrassing for us than a naive, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl whose biggest capital crime was to trust and trust her life and completely expose her. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and movies were never sexual, never pornographic, but she was kinky as a close caricature of all things. There was no realism, just parody. Mrs. Moll caught the essence of the character. She got 20 pounds to add a little bit of juice to her normally slim figure and when she put several photographers in the film, her body was Betty's. Her full frontal lack of any inhibitions fits exactly what Bettie published. Cinematic nudity usually depicts erotic or sexuality. In this movie it's about innocence. Seeing Gretchen / Bettie naked did not let me jump, but wanted to protect her from all the horrors that people can do to each other. Going this movie, you'll miss out on one of the best shows of the past year. By the way, the MPAA is ashamed of giving this an R rating.
