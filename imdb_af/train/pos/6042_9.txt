From movies to rent, I picked up Freebird. I struggled through the first third of the movie and wondered if the rest would be a waste to watch. Fortunately, it really warmed up, and I loved the movie very much. The second half of the movie laughed at me and laughed all the time. Fortunately, although some CGIs were included, it wasn't overdoing or general. <br /> <br /> I'll have to say - the actors all have heavy European accent, so be warned if you're having trouble understanding it. voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie and would have to order myself a copy for my own collection.
