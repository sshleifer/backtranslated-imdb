It is a movie that should be seen by anyone who is interested in, caused by, or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an incredibly accurate and sensitive depiction of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actors working in the theater today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in "Where the Truth lies". I would recommend this movie to be shown in all schools as you will never see this better. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one marvel at her ability to convey the anxiety of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. As barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional range is so accurate, every scene can be measured microscopically for the trauma's gradations, on a scale of rising hysteria and despair reaching intolerable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play with her mother, and does so with great sympathy and a variety of emotions, as fine as Lohman. Together they make some sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with each other. This movie is really an amazing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason you don't see it is if you're not interested in people. But even if you like the best of nature films, it is animal behavior at the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a plagued soul can destroy its own body in a madness of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who are in the depths of despair, then we are dead.
