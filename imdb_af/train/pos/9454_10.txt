In what is probably the best outdoor adventure movie of all time, four urban guys confront nature's wrath, in a story of survival. The area is Georgia, with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals carry the film with a depth of characterization, unmatched in film history. No central decisive "actors" can ever come close to these people's remarkable faces, voices or actions. I don't remember a movie in which the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. So much else, it's this eager realism that makes this movie so wonderful. <br /> <br /> Another strength is the movie's theme. Nature, in nature, can be violent. How appropriate the institution should be the American South. Very few places in the US, or were as violent as a red country. In a story about Darwin's survival of the strongest, the film carries the notion that people are part of nature, not separate from it. <br /> <br /> "Liberation" is much a product of his time when, unlike today, Americans have expressed concern about a vanished wilderness. The film's beautiful scenery, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar of river accelerations, combined with the absence of civilization, all carry an environmental message. And this is another strength of the movie. <br /> <br /> At an entertainment level, the tension escalates as the plot progresses. Not even halfway into the movie, the tension does not become extreme, and never leaves, not to the final credits. Very few movies can maintain such intensity over such a long plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the movie is topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And the acting is great. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is thrown perfectly and does a good job. And Jon Voight had to be nominated for an Oscar. If there is a poor link in the movie, it is the music that I consider to be slim. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Deliverance" will almost certainly appeal to viewers who want outdoor adventure. Even for those who don't, the eager characteristics, the acting and the plot tension are enough to see this movie, one of the best in theater history.
