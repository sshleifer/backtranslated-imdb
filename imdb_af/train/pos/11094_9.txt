This smooth and eager film is consistent. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated movies and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you're scratching your head, think "but I love SHORTY" you should be hit face). In my opinion, nobody takes the "feel" of Leonard's characters better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. Moving the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) raises the story's sleaze factor to incredible heights. Be a man, keep some beer and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite is Leonard books: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
