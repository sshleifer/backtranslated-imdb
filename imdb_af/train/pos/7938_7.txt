Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and some little kids who don't like them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunk night during a vacation in Las Vegas. They all come home and find that their respective children already know about the marriage because of tabloid-like non-sleepers. They, Rob and Josie, move them and their eight children in one or the other's house. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture, I think, close to Frank Lambert's (Patrick Duffy) construction work on the very similar step by step to justify eternal mockery. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of cookie-making queen, but she doesn't seem to make any of the cookies. Not close to Carol Foster's (Suzanne Somers) hairdressing cause to justify similar mockery, but hilariously preposterous enough to justify cruelty mockery. <br /> <br /> Unlike step by step they were a few before the holidays and they actually knew another's family names, or so one assumes whether they are serious enough to have a relationship together to take. <br /> <br /> In any case, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think they should call younger Andrew Andy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of product placement, especially for Soup at Hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some silly, senseless moments. It's also not a good movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But hey! Rob Estes! This includes my review of "Step by Step" on some very bad drugs. 'Look at Rob Estes and she's beautiful! Eyes. There are some good looking eyes shots.
