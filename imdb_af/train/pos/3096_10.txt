Six degrees enslaved me. I looked forward to this and was completely disappointed when Men in Trees replaced it. I thought it was just on hiatus and will be back in 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it ended. We can relate to the characters who had real problems. We talked about every episode and got our favorite characters. There was no one on the show I didn't like and felt the play was excellent. I always keep in mind that programs are typed in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to protest the cancellation of this show and ask to bring it back and return it. Give it a good time slot, don't keep it from today to today and advertise it so people will know it's up.
