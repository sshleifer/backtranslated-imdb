Good movie. Tell a boy fantasy story telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what extreme measures we need to take to act differently. Or at least the feeling: you have to break every line if you have to break one. If you want to express love to someone you don't know, how would you do it without creating an urgent social situation? It's also about fascism to decide on other cultural life, of what kind of culture is trapped in our throat. What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what our choice is. May one not drink coffee by one self in the morning. Should we listen to the NRJ scream, look at the stupid tabloid headlines and the street camps before even having our morning coffee?
