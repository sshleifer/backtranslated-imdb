Bela made 9 photos for Monogram, but it was only at this one, the 4th, that things began to come together. All others in the series will use this one as the essential template for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the series will also handle an essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) makes experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes in the basement of the old house) which causes things to flourish be. It was also the first time that Art Director Dave Milton had the chance to spread his wings. He came aboard for BLACK DRAGONS, the movie ahead, but this one is where he gets to get his craft started clicking. Lewis created a good atmosphere and was surrounded for the rest of the Monograms. Casting is the key in this, and it's a pretty good B movie, here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who will be in Lewtons' CAT PEOPLE movies. And Rosetto, from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice piece of poverty driving talent. If you have a limited time and budget, start with this one ... summarize everything they've learned so far, and give you something to compare the rest. The storyline? Bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young. They like to sleep in coffins. If you can read and smile, the rest will be easy.
