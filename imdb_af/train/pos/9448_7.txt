It was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The first part of the film, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, which sets out and emphasizes the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But it is misleading. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformity of rural residents are just the first disturbing aspects of the movie. I can still hear Bobby complaining in pain and shaking my mind. Lewis's leg dropped me. Yet, while the film was generally very disturbing and disturbing, it posed interesting questions. When is it moral, or right to take another's life? What can our morality do in some cases or not? And is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? As to any conclusions one can draw from the film, it is a performance in its own right (despite some aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).
