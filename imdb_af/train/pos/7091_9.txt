The big problem is where to start, as this movie needs your attention in the next two hours and you better not miss a few minutes to get a coke, as there is a danger you can't follow. But well there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis has to travel in a time machine to find out what antivirus is for a virus that dominates animals in the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, he only ends in 1990, then in World War I like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what one of the most intelligent scripts ever should be. This former Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF stories should be told and his cast of choice could not have been better, there is the ugly Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is unforgettable) and a wonderful Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger will. It's a movie you can watch over and over again, because the writing is so strange and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my great favorites.
