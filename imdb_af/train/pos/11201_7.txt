Surprisingly good early attempt by Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original screens written by Hitchcock himself shows this film's remarkable story structure. It starts with an exciting boxing match in which carnival champion "One Round" Jack is lost to a challenger of the audience who is a professional commander. The movie then slows down the characters and develops a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and the professional boxer. The rest of the movie is a dramatic build up to the repetition between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and proposition. A bracelet bought by the boxer for the girl continues to appear throughout the movie as a symbol of her infidelity. The only major opponent of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match has not yet been completed in 1927. The final match is therefore slightly anti-climbing. The story, however, is what carries this film through.
