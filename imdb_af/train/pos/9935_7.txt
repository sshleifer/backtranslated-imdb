My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * Dizzying * CHOP} My - me - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {To edit. CUT. Version} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director use so much flack for his style. At present, it is clear that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's cunning, flashy, dark editing technique. If I have to choose to love it and hate it, I will say I love it. It was sometimes a distraction from the border, but the end result was pretty good and it is nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if it borrows a lot of MTV videos ). <br /> <br /> This stylish look manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of a crook badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems odd. Otherwise, she played poorly because I had pretty much hated her character and didn't have one thing with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew is entangled in the FBI and suddenly has a contract of reality under Christopher Walken's TV production company (what is Christopher Walken in every film casually?). I think it's a clever movie technique because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV / Reality Show material as he likes. It is now a surprise of MTV culture. <br /> <br /> It follows that the story is told with an incredible rapidity, with very strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes; It's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a nice mess. This is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors are trying too hard to "cool" their characters, for one), but it works. I give it a bad 7/10 that may be generous compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who rated this movie? but i feel it has some good ideas and has done them well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
