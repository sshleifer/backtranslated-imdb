Once I got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I love it! The graphics were great for his time, a good plot, good courses and above All the best music I heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I don't quite remember the plot, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser and Mario had to save her. The object of the game is to get 120 stars of the curses in the castle. Each one has about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are parts of the castle where you can get more stars. But of course you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser. Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character and gets useful advice from Toad. So he is basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi were in the game. By the end. The biggest villain is Bowser, and there are a lot of other characters like Boo and Goomba.The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Next, how about the graphics? People say Gameplay is more important than graphics, and I totally agree. But with his big plot, there are good graphics. Especially for the time. I have a whole host of other Nintendo games such as 007 and their graphics do not compare to Super Mario. Real colors, great effects and great sound effects. I found the graphics in the water courses very well. In addition to the Bowser world, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, the music. This is my favorite part of the game. Raised, when I played it at a young age, I'd like to leave the game all night so the music would make me sleep. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful. There are others who are also great, especially in the world with Bowser, the one who likes me best and is my favorite. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer, and I love it. This game becomes 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO THE GAME PLAY!
