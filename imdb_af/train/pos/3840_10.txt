Jerome Crabbe starred in this movie. I've seen this movie six times and I'm still not tired of it. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a good writer. He wrote all the films by Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the largest directors. I saw all his movies except Showgirls. My mother doesn't like him so much, but I disagree. I think all his movies are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different, but still nice.
