It's one of a few cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and a space dog named K-9 is also included. This episode of Looney Tunes is very funny, has a pretty good cartoon animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is rather weird, so be prepared for it, it's a little boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin sent the Martian to earth to capture an earthly creature and bring it back to Mars. With his reliable dog K-9, Marvin sets out and finds the cuts of no other rabbit but Bugs Bunny! He greets them with delicacies, thinking they are tricks or treats in their costumes. He didn't realize they were preparing to take this rabbit to Mars. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned, you will probably like this. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
