A little slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very fascinating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring many memories back to what it feels like to be their age. The confusion and uncertainties are portrayed in a very simple way, but true to life. The music is perfect and the acting is great. The camera also works beautifully. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back at this particular time of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I will also say that this is a good movie for young people going through the years. There are so many films made about adolescence, but it captures the true essence of the discovery of the adult world of romance and its complexity.
