The film is open with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas). He tells a story about how his best friend - making that client - Jim Mixes (Cary Grant) and his family packed tightly into a small apartment in New York, with not enough closet space. Too many bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, exec Jim advertises (or falls for!) An ad for a home. As soon as he bought the house, the bills and frustration went on tirelessly because everything that could go wrong with building Jim's dream home went wrong. <br /> <br /> One of the three partnerships between Grant and Loy, it's a beautiful little comedy - not much tax, with no real big message, but a great way to spend an hour or two spending. The laugh is there from the beginning, when the alarm goes off and Jim tries to turn it off, just to be strayed by Muriel at every turn. The timing and delivery of comic lines and situations can only be given by some seasoned benefits, and that's just what Grant and Loy give us: sophisticated performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy is in a nice, ungrateful role (it is clear that Grant's character Jim gets the lion's share of the lines and the play, and Grant pulls off both with remarkable aplomb as always, but she gives Muriel a color, live and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas also plays cruel entertainment to perfection, and never touches a single wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes should definitely be if Bill is locked up in the store room and Jim is going to save him "just to get everyone trapped! Every little problem that arises for the Mix Refurbishment project - including small jealousy and an advertising campaign for 'Wham' - seem to bring everything that can go wrong with building a new home, but make it credible and a pleasant watch.
