Who would think Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But this is just one of several strange and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenage battle creature movie, which can best be described as Rebel without a reason for God, knowing about outer space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less good), a good boy with just enough game to be interesting; The very healthy little girl still understood is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-roders, but they are much more nonplussed when they get a gelatinous, man-edible encounter. What is it that falls on its own hot meteorite on the earth - right and left. But will the adults believe them? Of course not, what do they know, they are just kids! <br /> <br /> The movie is a teenager better at his teen bopping best. The actors take the very predictive writing very seriously, with a lot of psychological look in each other's eyes, and the "adult" supporting role play probably says "Kids!" very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film is its creature, which is well-imagined, well-executed and often manages a surprising amount of tension. And although it's clearly on the cheap side (look at the miniature sets, guys!), The BLOB is a pretty well-made movie - and that catchy, small theme song has been won. The 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the film as a nostalgia, but it will not keep them from sensibility along with the younger set on its entire milk and white bread 1950s. The movie will be a good choice for a family movie or a more sophisticated 'all-out'. Make many Jello cubes for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
