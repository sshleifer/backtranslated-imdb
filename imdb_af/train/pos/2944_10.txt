It's off the beaten track ever. I saw a lot of exciting performances, got quite a few performances, and watched the Comic View from Bet, but I've never seen anyone who could fit Murphy's skills to this show. The impressions are excellent, the sketch is great, and the timing is perfect. You can even say the crowd really gets in. When he smelled a few years later, it was also very good, but it is # 1 in my book. Also show that Murphy was funny at one time, especially in the early to mid-eighties. My favorite parts of the show are when he comes to the family barbecue and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! The ice cream man!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
