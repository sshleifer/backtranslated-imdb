Before that, the defective "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this screen adaptation of "Mother Night" is very true of the book and holds the comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, it was not Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of "Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing about this movie is that you shouldn't be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). It's probably also from Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a bad job that you were better off reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film.
