See this movie for the first time while drinking at a Canada motel. As it swung through channels, the Easy Lube section came over. My friend sat down, but I told him to go back. Something about the name easy lube just doesn't sound right. Look at the rest of the movie, it was pretty damn funny. Write down some names from the credits and come home to look it up. It seems to be Chevy Chase's first movie. I didn't remind him. Didn't remember much about it, so I rented it and gave it a second time. It's pretty funny and pretty graphic. It's just like Kentucky Fried Movie, except not so funny. Love the fingers, easy lube, and I'm part of the president daily. Traders skit is also beautiful. I give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
