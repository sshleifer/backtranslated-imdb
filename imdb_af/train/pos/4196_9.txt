This crime thriller is like a film noir, but changes the context of post-war to the Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In the "Pickup on South Street" policemen are good guys, criminals are real guys, and the only enemies are "The Commies", which is ultimately differentiated from the good people, because they are emotionally personalized, driven by a real care for their own value, as evidenced by the ongoing traces of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie turns around characters. The personalities in this movie are quite unique and detailed: skip the licking suit that can pose any danger, and sometimes as they go through their personal belongings; Tired the informant just trying to save for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and the audience); Candy, the so-called innocent girl who just thinks she is doing government work and doesn't understand the conspiracy she is involved with; and Joey, the ex-boyfriend, angry Commie baddie who tries to hide everything from everyone and ironically the worst person to do it. Throw a lot of colorful supporting characters (like the guy with the chopsticks and policemen) and "Pickup on South Street" treat you with a splendor of personalities while pursuing the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
