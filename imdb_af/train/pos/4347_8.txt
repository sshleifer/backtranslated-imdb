I won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie, as other reviewers have covered the same territory. <br /> <br /> Just wanted to say I really enjoyed the movie. Peter Falk's show alone is enough reason to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A small-scale road trip film with Falk & Paul Reiser in Upstate NY this fall is the setting for most of the action in the movie. . <br /> <br /> Very well written with a mature target audience in mind. Much of the reality-based humor and some well-played drama gives the film a feeling that it can be your own family. <br /> <br /> Can't really say enough about this movie, except it's a shame that a lovely movie like it no longer gets exposure, while others are uncomfortable junk out there. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk again with a great lead and he makes the most of it. It proves that his well-known friend and writer / director John Casavettes plays right in Falk in many of his landbreaking films of the 60's and 70's.
