STAR RATING: ***** Indispensable **** Many good *** Good ** You can go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Stopping career stick Kate (Franka Potente ) go to the London subway to catch a train to meet George Clooney. But after a busy working day, she relaxes and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform. As she moves on a situation that takes her from one daunting encounter to the next, she learns of something far more evil and evil waiting for her. <br /> <br /> In many ways the British have the film industry become one of its own, especially in the horror thriller section, with movies like Creep and the successful 28 Dae Later (with strong echoes in parts) .) In terms of success in what it has set out to do, Creep creates smart (especially at the beginning) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear. With its clever time, it also (unintentionally I suspect) honors some of the pioneers' high concept horror movies from the 70's that rely on shocks and fears through without really focusing too much on character development and such. <br /> <br /> Some of the weaknesses are a bit predictable, but it doesn't really make it any less scary or effective in any way. I'm not sure the end was meant to make it come off as some morality game and it's not exactly perfect, but it's definitely very effective and serves the basic function very well. ***
