This was the second of the series of 6 "classic Tarzan movies with Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, it was a great movie in this series and coming perhaps as an intermediate film in a progression that could almost portray the development of the theater from the early 1930s to the 1940s, as it showed good pace, but not as well as subsequent films. The movie lesson was reached less than later Tarzan films in this series, the stock I saw was of unequal quality, with some grainy landscapes and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes. Tarzan movies are missing here, but on the other hand, there is a scene early on that features the rugged movements of a camera with a backward-facing leaf while the camera looks back, after which the safari men move forward in the jungle. swaying, really almost modern in style, and standing In contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, one of the interesting features here was Jane's proximity and instability, when she was subject to Martin's flirtations. The kiss? and Jane's stunned, and partly guilty, reaction ?? predict something from the Jane we will see in these movies in the future. Compare for example in Tarzan Find a Son! Jane's double actions that Tarzan deceives and delivers Boy to his family. Later she admitted to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here is nothing quite as explicit, but we once returned Jane to Jane Parker of last year and in an almost remorseful series of actions, herself from the evening dress that Martin and Harry had brought her to get away from Tarzan. /> <br /> There was a whole series of images and sequences that hit me especially in this show. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the picture we get from Tarzan's household is here, as later, a combination of sensual ideals with always the immediate possibility of violent death. This to me is at the heart of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some very violent scenes, even according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan who led the elephants in the Valley of the Elephant's Cemetery; Tarzan is rescued by the hippo from watery death, and then nursed to health by the monkeys; The Cheetah will find Tarzan if Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment. In particular, the Cheetah over the river on the log. The last battle scenes of wild and lion on the ground and wild and monkeys in the trees. Jane, who shows us that she is really of Tarzan's world, quickly shows her enterprising woodwork to work up a firearm to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is wonderful: suddenly Tarzan is on the scene fling wild animals from the trees and controlling the lions and elephants to the rescue! Tarzan's last jubilee, with a happy Jane in his arms, with a dancing and delighted Cheetah next to them, is a memorable picture and a fine summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
