<br /> <br /> There is STAR TREK cannon - many of them. From cannon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contact with new creatures, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> BUSINESS holds off much of ST canon. An unfortunate fact for a long time serious fans. As one, I assumed that the producers would look at least the first few episodes of TOS and retro back from there - but no. <br /> <br /> The phase pistols, like lots of technology, look much more modern than in TOS. An Old Star Fleet laser gun, a slow golden speckle effect - that's what I expected to see. I also didn't expect to hear pure squeezed sound effects similar to TNG, but far from TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the earliest views of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE) we see a Star Fleet with a more formal military aspect - a bit of the old Earth fleet. With BUSINESS we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in BUSINESS. It is good that Captain Archer is uncertain about the needs of the Universe (quite different from Kirk who never had confidence in his application of human justice). ), but within ENTERPRISE everyone looks like an equal. Unprofessional, uncertain, far from the sense of formal military service than in any ST series - and it says a lot! <br /> <br /> The casual country music opening theme song repeats the journey of a family rather than the adventures of a major military vessel. <br /> <br /> BUSINESS seems to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships, rather than taking us on a historic, greasy, eager, high-ranking exploration of space. <br /> <br /> I would have chosen Adrian Paul to play the Captain and an elder as a doctor. Yet I liked the actors the most. Linda Park, an excellent ballroom dancer from Boston College, will definitely develop nicely. The characters that make up the crew look good. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE started its run stronger than the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
