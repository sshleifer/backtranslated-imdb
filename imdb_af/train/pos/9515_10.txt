One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic end. The film is about the Sullivan family. Michael Sullivan (the father) is, of course, one of the most important members of the mafia, the killer to say so, and an expert. One of the kids wants to know the work of his father (a terrible mistake), so he hides on his father's car and he sees Tom Hanks in action to say so. <br /> <br /> Doing Mafia There are no rules, in Mafia nobody wins, when they want you, they take you out. Of course, you can see someone who works in the mafia with a huge home, the best car in the world you want, but do the wrong job or make something your "boss" doesn't want and you're fired , and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. seeing something he didn't have to see, and well, almost all his family were killed for that "wrong thing" his son did The movie is really entertaining, you see how the Sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia. Or so it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit sad, shows us revenge, the dirty work people do, almost everything you want. Hopefully the man reads this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia, make yourself a favor and get hell out of the country before being murdered by your boss and their workers. <br /> <br /> This movie receives: 10/10
