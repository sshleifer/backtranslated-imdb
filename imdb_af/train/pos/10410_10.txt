Baghdad's thief is one of my 10 favorite movies. It is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art is flawless. The decisive could not have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. And the image of evil is definitely captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the beam very high. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and don't get tired of it. This movie is an adventure for all ages. Nobody is too old to enjoy it. The thief of Bahgdad shoots my memories to a more innocent time ... I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the US was about to enter World War II. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he could continue this underlying "malice" a few years later in "Casablanca". And Korda apparently went with Justin and Dupree to "The Four Feathers" again ...
