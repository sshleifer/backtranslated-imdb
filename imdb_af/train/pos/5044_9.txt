Bill Paxton stares in and directs this highly original movie. After I first watched, I was through how good it was. The reviews I heard were OK. As a result, I expected an average thriller. In spite of Paxtons, however, the excellent direction and action of the movie is worth watching, especially if you are a horror movie fanatic. The movie is also helped by the plot twists that remain to the closing credits. The movie's strongest point is the storyline I have to say is very original and is like I've ever seen. Well done to the two young leaders who perfectly convey the emotions than these confused boys. I give this movie 9/10 and I recommend everyone catch up with it.
