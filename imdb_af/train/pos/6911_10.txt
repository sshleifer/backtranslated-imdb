While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" threw Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unknown Latin American country, this time he is working for a dictator in a fictitious Latin American country. Specifically, the dictator suddenly dies, so Julia replaces el-presidents with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who shoots a film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss must find out how to be a dictator and balance it with his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to change the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with it. No matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. It just goes to show why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era, and we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Sonia Braga (who played with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first woman is warm.
