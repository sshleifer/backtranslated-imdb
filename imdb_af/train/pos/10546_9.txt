I watched this movie because I had a free, new blockbuster release and had to grab something soon, because the store was ready to close for the evening. The white white cover and title inspired me. I am a (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son is a young man of 30. I adore movies that are pure entertainment, such as The Sixth Sense, Interview With Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a film student and enjoys many specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We usually hate each other's movie selections, but we've both NOT watched and loved the movie! It was different from any movie we have ever seen. We are both cynical / critical personality types and we usually crack in movies while we watch it - but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is our opinion that if this movie was promoted and displayed in the mainstream theaters in the US, it did indeed very well.
