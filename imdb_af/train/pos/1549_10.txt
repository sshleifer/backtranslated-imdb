There are movies, and there are movies. Movies are more often than not just sweets, but movies are real works of art. Fraulein Doktor is definitely well placed in the latter. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what I consider the best quality of the film. All she did to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the time in the mouth of morphine addiction, Fraulein is being treated very heavily by the German high command despite all her efforts. The scene in which the Doctor is transferred to the rear seat of a Mercedes Benz command is alone, deserted and sobering, perhaps one of the most stunned, but truest portrayals of a "spy's" fate in life. Only the emotional pain that Richard Burton in the Spy came into the Cold came closer to. Fraulein Doktor is a much deeper film than one can realize about a single viewing. I just wish the producers will find it good to download it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it, and those who have seen it, can enjoy (again and again) this exceptional movie.
