It's a very cool movie! I only remember to see it when I was very young and I watched it once a week. Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's really cool how they train the animals to do all those things. However, parts of the movie are sad (such as when Sassy, ​​the cat, the waterfall falls and when the shadow finally falls into the hole.) I saw the second Homeward Bound, but I have to say it's not as good as the first . Shade is the smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies, or speaks animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
