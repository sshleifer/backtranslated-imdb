Love the movie. Loved the two families crossing roads in history. Only question is if Sam is killed, how does his family's line continue? He is Madame Zeroni's son and Zero is supposed to be related but not to mention other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Name any other child or woman before talking to the teacher and falling in love? Perhaps she had a child before she became the Stocking Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved. The acting was wonderful. Not sure where the story was with sir. Sir, Marion is a woman at the end, but makes his character even louder. The other "counselor" got worried for the kids, but of course not so much. Poor Warden had had a very stinking childhood to be so mean when she grew up.
