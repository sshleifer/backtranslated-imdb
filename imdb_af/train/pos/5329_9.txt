<br /> <br /> The picture was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The plot was deadly. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are confronted. <br /> <br /> However, provided you can light enough to laugh, it was a penetrating skirt that combines the Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad things were more stupid than bad. The good guys were not too good. Black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of a baby has made a good contact. Sympathy may have been a little different. <br /> <br /> I don't have to agree on the acting. It was generally very good. I really wanted to punch Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And that's not the point of a very good movie that Judge Reinhold wants to punch?
