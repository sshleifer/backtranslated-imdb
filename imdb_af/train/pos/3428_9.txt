I saw this movie tonight in NYC at the Landmark Sunshine. I didn't know what to expect, I didn't want to read much of it, because I knew I'd see it, no matter what. All in all, it was done very well. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements that left me politics. The soldiers mainly talked about their awareness of toxicity in their training in the boat camp, and how difficult it was when they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia tell of the trouble not only to survive the war but to refuse the order to go back when it was against personal morals. Don't make a mistake - it's not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says it hasn't seen it or lives with the scars of war on their souls.
