This movie reminds me that some old Black & White movies are definitely worth the look. <br /> <br /> Initially, I had a few reservations, but from the beginning of the movie to the end when I was captivated. I was very impressed with the mix of drama, tension and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIEUS and has always had me in stitches. <br /> <br /> Definitely define this movie after your movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressed and "too" powerful or too many "funny" movies of today.
