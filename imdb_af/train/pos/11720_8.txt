I didn't expect much, and to be honest, I didn't like this movie for the first time, but I saw it again and realized that it's so cool. Sure, it's a funny movie, but it's a funny gag. <br /> <br /> Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. I think this movie has the potential to be an over-the-top My cousin Vinny. But with an abomination host instead of an attorney. Unfortunately, this is a wasteful opportunity. With just a little more writing it can be a classic. The children are underutilized there is no reason they should turn on Elvira. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been good to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy, but it's small differences that separate the good movies from the brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elvira itself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Every time she smiles, you will too. It's hard to beat a movie when the main character is so charming. And it's actually her charm, don't let her fool her thinking she's a kind of tart. Well, she's. But she's nice. The kind of person you want to care for your kids. Wouldn't cook her for them, though ... <br /> <br /> I'd recommend letting it go. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much. <br /> <br /> She's more than just a big set of boobs. She is also an incredible pair of legs.
