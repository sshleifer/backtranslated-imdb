Paul (Jason Lee) is an underachiever who only deals with a type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses his clothes and his daily schedule. At his baccalaureus party, Paul gets a little too drunk and somehow he ends a pretty dancer, Becky (Julia Stiles), back to his digs. "Nothing happened," as they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen came by phone. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul took Becky out of the place, though her briefs remained behind. But there's even more fun. At a family dinner at Karen's parents' house, Paul returns to Becky and learns that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanation to do! But, instead, Paul chose to make a stomach problem and hide in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's place? And what will the consequences be? I'm sorry for critics who make such a movie. They should definitely be relieved because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, it doesn't matter that Lee is a completely funny man, Stiles is a beautiful beauty or that Blair is natural as a beautiful but anal fiancee. The rest of the movie, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also very nice. The look of the movie is great, just like the costumes and California institutions. Best of all, the writing is imaginative and inspired and creates great laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the proverbial jokes, get this movie tonight. It may not be Academy Award material, but it is absolutely guaranteed to make a bad day in a darn good one.
