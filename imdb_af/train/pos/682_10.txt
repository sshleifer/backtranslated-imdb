This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and although it may be too slow for some, it's worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged in a case where "Aborigines" are involved, and this is not a common case. OK, a man died, but it wasn't exactly a normal murder. There was also a greater rainfall than average rainfall, and the atmosphere of most of the movies is somewhat claustrophobic and repressive. The Aborigines take a secret and refuse to waste the beans. It has a lot to do with white men who make assumptions about "City" vs "Tribal" Aborigines, and of course no Abo will practice tribal methods in the big city. Uh huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what happens, although no matter how many times I've seen it, I can't understand the exact relationship. It's a very exciting and creepy movie, and is a great example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nothing. The end is a bit ambiguous, but I take it literally, it's the easiest way out and the most frightening. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
