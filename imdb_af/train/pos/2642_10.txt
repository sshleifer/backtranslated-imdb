Surely this is a 'heartwarming' movie. It won the George Peobody Award and won "Roots" so it can tell you something of the essence of this movie. I look at the internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, co-authored this movie for a few years, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him . I would like her to see only granddaughters, my daughters, this movie, as well as surrendering this wonderful story to his grandparents. My oldest daughter was seven years old when it was broadcast on television and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I will not 'spoil' this movie for you.
