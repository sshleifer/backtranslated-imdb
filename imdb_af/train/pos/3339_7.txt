Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are back in there. With the "Fever Pitch", the creators of other films that dealt with many gross themes abandoned the tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's movie to the screen, which would be difficult to do. The novel, of the same title, dealt with a man's obsession with football, as it is in England, where sport consumes most British sports friends. This is despite the writing team Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell turning the book into a language that will appeal to most Americans when they make their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a film that presents an obsessive fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life spins in the Red Sox season and who is an eighth grade teacher with unpleasant ways around his students. to engage in the subject he is trying to learn. When Ben takes four of his best students for a tour of a local firm, he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the good Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who goes places, but at thirty has no life of its own. br /> <br /> The story follows the two lovers through the ritual to attend the Red Sox at home games at Fenway Park. This team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world, with a team doing great things, but until 2004 they never won a World Series. In fact, the end of what we heard had to be changed because it was the year in which they eventually won the event that disrupted them for eighty six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple in the middle of the movie. Ms Barrymore is a natural that always surprises her appearance in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular television comedian, has become a movie actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in "Taxi", in our humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The Farrelly brothers movie will also satisfy their fans. as baseball fans with this baseball story.
