"Amazing Grace" has a cowardly feel about it as it tells a contemporary story of several lives in an apartment building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but the drama can take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics with equal aplomb. It doesn't judge the characters, but sets it straight ahead, as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and the observations on the characters are sharp and sharp. I really appreciate this flowing movie.
