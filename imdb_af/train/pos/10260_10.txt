The first installment of this infamous horror series suggests that a woman is kidnapped by a gang of black clothes torturing her for a few days before finally killing her. She is cruelly beaten, her fingernails in the chair endlessly endless, Diergut is thrown at her, hot boiling water is thrown on her and eventually her eyeball is bent through a needle (really sick and nasty scene). The creators of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this is the closest thing to a snap movie you can get without committing murder. Of course, some of the special effects are pretty poor, but the idea of ​​making a sniff is pretty horrible. I also saw "flowers of flesh and blood". which is more greedy and sadistic, but less disturbing. Anyway, this one is a must-see for horror fans!
