While I was an impressive youth when I first experienced the Gundam Wing series, I confirmed my belief that I didn't re-animate this series, but the plot, the gundam design, character design and character depth were masterfully executed. . Although the attractive appeal of the characters appears first and foremost as a boy band, it can be partially credited to just fine art, with individual personalities that create clear and intricate distinction between characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to draw on any particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While advocating a sentimental attachment to this show for my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we get peace?), While the action-packed battles are huge Robot packs are provided, which is the least, is excellent.
