I just watched the movie. I was afraid it would disappoint me. I was already almost surprised. The American cake franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. Yes, it won't be true if I say I enjoy it as a mess as I enjoyed the original. beta house with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies have. It's not going to be a classic as the first two have already done so. but what the hell is - it is still very funny with very good moments and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to enjoy and relax after a hard day at work or school. Payhouse earned 6/10 but I gave it 7/10 just because I was another piece of PIE.
