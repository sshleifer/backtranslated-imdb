Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims he has information about a series of killers that were fought by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives in the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle is requesting evidence, and the man has told the story of his life since childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widow father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathered the two brothers and told them that an angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the scary movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and I watched again yesterday, now on DVD. Although it's a low-budget movie, the screenplay is sharp, without error. The cast is excellent, but I would like to emphasize Matt O'Leary's performance as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be played by a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A good debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand). If it was at least 'The God's Hand', it could be acceptable. But this movie as "the devil's hand" is indeed ridiculous. Scripter writer Brent Hanley did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
