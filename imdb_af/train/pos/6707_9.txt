I know sometimes it's really very corny ... But the play is wonderful and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I really love this show, and I'm almost embarrassed that I do b / c, the show has a rep. because it is really corny, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that it can sometimes be a fairly low budget. Sometimes actors change and you just have to handle it. As Sabrina's father is 2 different guys in the course of the movie ... I mean, can't they say Just say he's uncle or something? Yet I can't help loving this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a very cute couple and Salem is absolutely hilaries. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for some light and funny entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season seasons. As soon as you get to college, Morgan joins the group and her dialogue is painful and very poor ... Plus she's ugly, so the jokes about how she just looks good about her has lost me. But I think it was a very good eighth season and I was very sad to see one of my favorite programs canceled. !
