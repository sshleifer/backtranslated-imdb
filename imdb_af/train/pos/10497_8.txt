I just thought it was excellent and I still do. I'm grateful that we can still see different things from what Hollywood is almost flooding us. Grace's rescue is clever and enjoyable - those who are offended by the dagga of the dagga, are better off looking at America's bride-like movie. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie shouldn't be stupid. I laughed most of my asses, but also questions about what the female main character had to do to pay her deceased debt. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - a witty story with typical English humor and good acting and directing. You can't ask anymore. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
