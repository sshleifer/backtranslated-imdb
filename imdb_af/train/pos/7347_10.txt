I forgot Ralph Bakshis masterpiece Fire & Ice on an old OOP rental video. <br /> <br /> Good for one thing, it's better than any other Conan-esque movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's cute, but who cares? It was the test of time, and the only way it looks like is to be compared to modern fantasy epics such as LOTR: FOTR (though I love the movie.) <br /> <br /> The plot goes as follows : After a fight between Fire & Ice, a royal daughter is kidnapped by Jarol's (under) subhuman creatures, while an only survivor of a victimized town rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yes, it doesn't sound like an original as a nurse. Betty, but that's not the point. It's really an interesting idea of ​​a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Concerning action scenes: wonderful. They are well handled, have massive suspension, and have very loud noises. Just look at the climate battle, now it's an end! <br /> <br /> The play and dialogue: capable. Really. They are not nominated for an Oscar, but they are OK and do not get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Shot on 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many of the wallpapers look very detailed and well-drawn, and although the character designs have a little one-dimensional feel, they are OK. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fine neglected gem and will make you more entertaining. as any of the superfic "entertainment". 10/10
