If it's an American movie, I'll evaluate it 7: we've seen it before. If it's an Argentine movie, and I'm Argentina, I'd like to give it a 10 because it's the kind of quality I expected - rather than what I expected. The excellent quality is amazing, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd World. <br /> <br /> I can't forget the scene, if Díaz forces Silverstein's fiancé to confess - you know what I mean when you're the Movie. I think it's the most important moment of the movie, not surprising, but original. This is when the right action begins. <br /> <br /> Before I watch a movie, I always try to collect some previous information. If it's a mainstream, satirical, commercial one, I'm pushing "Play" and suspending reality and logic, I want to say the best state of mind to enjoy such movies. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, but it is credible in a certain way. As for me, I couldn't stop laughing at every joke and comment - "sos malo" ("you're mean") ... sitting in the mouth of Díaz, the greatest one. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty tired of watching movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he is a beautiful actor, but sometimes I feel unfairly playing the rest, Luis Luque's role in this case. I'm not very fond of Argentine television, so I didn't see much work by Luque, but it's pretty clear he is an excellent artist. His physical role, his stare, his content in this movie fell in love with his performance. I think his role needs some upgrading, just to let him see how big he can be! <br /> <br /> I don't know if Szifrón is planning to make a successor or not. I know he won't do it if it's the rule that "second parts were never good", so if he does, I'll surely see it. And I hope that in the future there will also be the opportunity to give Peretti's peers the same chances to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, good shows and lots of laughs!
