Easily 9 out of 10 for a movie by director we will continue to grow to admire. But don't look at this movie that is expected to be entertained. Ang Lee looks objectively at a relatively untapped aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the movie, like all Lee's films, is that he is not "she" with his characters. He creates characters, embodies them with life, problems and ambiguities ... and gives them a reality that often becomes very close to home than is very comfortable. This film has action, but it's not for the action lover, as the violence is very disturbing and far from gratuitous. That is, like the characters, it really is. And as you would expect from one of the most terrible wars in man, violence is terrible. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that certainly remained within the Civil War, this is a masterpiece. Was the war over slavery and abolition? Lee seems pretty prepared to blur that line as popular in images as the Blue and the Gray. However, this is not about idealism, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It's about freedom, the desire to have something that is yours and to fight for it. As you look at the characters, you will ask yourself, "How can they fight to keep slavery?" The fact is, I don't think they really are, and so the film shows the problem of why so much is trapped in the flood of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The fact is clear that many of the characters we are learning are struggling with the "house" loyalty, although they never investigated how the house is represented or whether they really are his values. do not see. The fonts are very mobile yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limit. And when the tension finally catches, and these characters suddenly find themselves "free", we see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> All these things blended with Lee's beautiful incorporation of man's environment with breathtaking views and frames. Lee has a style that somehow is Europe in his "art" (a slow camera, unrushed), asian in his epic nature and development of story, yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so much in North Americans. /> <br /> Relax, leave your assumption about what the Civil War is, what is the "Western" as a genre, which must be a war film ... and let Ang Lee take you in a world so fragile, so hard, so really that little of us can see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he did in Ice Storm. Again, the movie is slow and clear "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to regulate without setting him up on the story or screen. His direction is enhanced by what he brings out of Jewel (yes, the singer), an untouched actress who performs an incredible performance. <br /> <br /> A movie for those who love film and not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.
