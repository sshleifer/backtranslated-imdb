"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful story about a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, escaping her suffocating roots to become herself. Although the title character is artificially played by the beautiful Ashley Judd - probably her first film role, although one is very proud of - the emphasis is not to become someone, a last the next Madonna (or Jesus' mother or the angry , attentive singer). <br /> <br /> This puts the emphasis on the next instincts and becomes somewhat introspective about them, becoming the ideal adult. NOTE: This is not an action movie !!! It uses a voice-over (by Judd) while writing in her diary - and I see I lost the male half of the readers out there. But be patient with this beautiful film, where we learn that one's happiness can be discovered. Oh, I can't carry water and heel. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / writer Todd Field, who played Nick. Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut", co-stars as Ruby Lee's noble love interest, one who helps her, heals her relationships in the youth. <br /> <br /> But not even his character is the answer for Ruby Lee. : No external hero was imposed on her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible. Author / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee's Gold", did a wonderful job of growing a young woman in herself - which is the challenge of older vs. good vs. confront evil under the road. <br /> <br /> The supporting role-play is also stars, and the music used, especially the tracks by chanteuse Sam Phillips (which I hear is T. Bone Burnett's wife), is right - especially " Try to stick to the Earth. "Now, when I hear the first few chords of that song, tears jump to my eyes, Pavlovian and unbelievers - not sure if it's the music, or the indelible link with the movie quiet, beautiful message of empowerment. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his / her way. For any woman of any age, this is a must see! The downside: It is NOT on DVD except in Spanish. (We learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of a VHS version, which can easily be found online. My beloved husband got someone with a VHS copy and made a DVD copy for me .) Although this treasure of a movie sometimes appears on the air? on an indie channel, usually ?? You can't count on it when you need it most as a tonic to calm the pressure of the world. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a great re-release, and it would, if I was Queen of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
