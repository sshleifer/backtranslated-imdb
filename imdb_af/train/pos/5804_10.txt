Michael Jackson is no longer popular in the US, but in Europe (especially Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and that is: it has no plot, it is full of clich√©s, Michael praises himself constantly. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can't expect a plot or non-clients. in this kind of movie! It has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect. The Smooth Criminal fragment - the greatest song ever, full of Moonwalks, group dances and even the famous Michael Jackson bank. It makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces with an equally beautiful (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance activities. <br /> <br /> But if I'm a MJ fan, I have to warn Michael Jackson's haters out there: DO NOT watch this movie, you'll just raise your hatred ...
