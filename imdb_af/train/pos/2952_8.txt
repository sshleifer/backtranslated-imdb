Judy Davis shows us here why she is one of Australia's most respected and beloved actors - her portrayal of a lonely, aimless nomad is the first time. A teenager Claudia Karvan also gives us a look at what will make her one of the country's most popular actors in the coming year, with future roles in THE GREAT STEEL, THE HARTBREAK KID, THE THIRD OF THE FINE, RISK and the famous TV series THE SECRET LIFE OF US. (By the way, as a child, Karvan was a young girl whose stolen toy panda was stolen outside a pharmacy in the 1983 drama with Tracey Mann.) If these movies come, make sure you see it !! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT DECISION, LANTANA.
