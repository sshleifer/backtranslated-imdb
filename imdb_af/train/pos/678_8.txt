Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense attorney whose life is becoming increasingly unaffected by reality as he goes deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribe rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to lead Chamberlin through the sphere of 'Dreamtime', an alternative reality / timeline central to native Australian history and tribal use. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in the plot, builds the film into a disturbing final that is slightly reduced by poor effects, probably due to budget constraints. Nonetheless, an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and fear is just below the surface of what we regard as "reality" will remain with you.
