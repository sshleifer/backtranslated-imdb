A flying saucer (literally) manned by a crew of about 20 male explorers travels hundreds of millions of light-years from Earth to embark on a colony founded on a "forbidden planet" some 25 years ago. What they find is a more advanced robot than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and completely socially indifferent young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist who is more than the demons of ancient civilization, he has immersed him. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but it's a stretch, and in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Tried of what it makes a scifi movie, certainly The Tempest, but how many hundreds of movies can you say something similar? <br /> <br /> At the bottom is a warning story about progress and technology and the social evolution needed for its appropriate and safe use. Still, the film continues with all the hope for our future that we expected from shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the background, are powerful enough to make the uninspired direction and uneven action almost untouchable. If it wasn't for the goofy retro-art deco of the 1950s, sci-fi props, you might be looking for a 1960s piece. <br /> <br /> It's a classic of those very special subgenre of sci fi I want to call the 1950s sci-fi, and although not, in my opinion, the best is definitely a must see for anyone interested in sci-fi film and special effects. The clever plot, now rendered by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to and will retain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be especially interested in the various aspects of the movie that allegedly broadcast inspired themes of Star Trek's original series about twelve years later, although they may be disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind racial integration. While I wasn't intending to nitpick, the lack of social progress in this movie was the one major problem I had with it. <br /> <br /> Some will probably see this movie, just to get a look at young, nice Leslie Nielsen in one of his first lead roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and sometimes poorly from the right (especially against the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, who is quite excellent in other films, also plays his part. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the incredible Robby Robot are the striking actors in this crowd, although the character players filling in the ensemble generally do a good job. The problems with leading performances, I think, are so much the fault of the director and the editor, than anything. Although they definitely did most of the movie.
