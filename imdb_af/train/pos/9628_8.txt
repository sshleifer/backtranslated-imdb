Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies have very, very little plot. Instead, they give them a fairly everyday situation and just let them be hilarious! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSY LIGHTS are one of the funniest things to see if the boys' work or house is clean. Here in FIREWORKS most of the movies are similar to these other two movies. Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the movie cleaning a crazy professor's chimney. See Ollie by the chimney, the boys who mess up the house and Stanley's insane behavior all work together to make a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> But in a strange twist, there is also a very strange subplot that starts and ends the movie. It seems the professor is really a crazy scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. Late in the movie you see him make a duckling in a duckling and even a duckling in an egg! Since he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is this a surprise what happens next? While this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What worked perfectly was the middle part. Give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. One of the team's better movies and it earned almost 9.
