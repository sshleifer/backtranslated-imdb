In the early nineties I read a little ad in a few horror magazines about Liebe des Totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. This awakened my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). The Nekromantik movies are Ok, even interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia (even though they are horror-opera entries rather than addressing the viewers' minds, it's actually funny.) < Br /> <br /> LESSON, on the other hand, is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consists of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, death as the very physical dissolution of the body. The movie is a metaphor about life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the children they actually are. The fact that we cannot really grasp the nature of death, and therefore not the process of death, is the core message of the film. It's a most realistic movie. Buttgereit never tries to hide the dead behind the white roses. No matter what moral standards you set, death is inevitable and will not be a fiction sooner or later, but YOUR reality. This applies to you, best reader, as it applies to the viewers of the movie. Some young reviewers do not want to understand this, it is fully excused as they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> It's not an exploitation cookie. Why? Because death does not exploit people. It is harvesting us. We are growing for seven days, then we are brought back to the Schopenhauerian state of prenatal, that is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest stories. Whether you choose to regard it as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is up to you. At first glance, it may look very dark. However, consider that something else must die to be able to live something. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body that is digested by the stomach, it does not only show decomposition, but PROCESSING new life. Isn't it better to die and give life to virgins and then to birds and eventually to land, than to stay the living dead zombie, which is one of the genre's favorite pets? <br /> <br /> When you realize it, you see Der Todesking its true context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat the week, every last hour. Seven are the days of the week (weak, mortal!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of the Reaper, Buttgereit doesn't tell us, because the Reaper just takes what is ripe. And apples that are not picked for food will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, fellow IMDBs! <br /> <br /> (And look at this movie, which only compares with Ingemar Bergmans "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
