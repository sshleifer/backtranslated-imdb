Talking about an explosion opening, "Trampa Infernal" has the coolest opening credits ever! Guided by musical tones that may be slightly inspired by the legendary theme "Friday the 13th" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the main players appear on the screen divided into giant syllables. Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller and it just gets cooler with every minute of passing. Two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other for the ultimate revelation in a thin bar. According to a newspaper article, there is a wild boar in the nearby forest, which has killed several of the hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge is that anyone who kills the bear is declared the ultimate macho hero with the greatest set of balls. On arrival, however, it becomes clear that they are not against a bear, but a confused and completely manic war veteran with a reasonable weapon arsenal in his hideout and numerous armed forces on his sleeve. After a decade of tame and derived American slashers, this early 90's looks Mexican and feels refreshing and alive. The formula is simplistic but effective, the main characters are credible enough and building up the confrontations with the sadistic killer is pretty exciting. The maniac had to be a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as he also used a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasantly annoying and barbaric, after which I actually had hope since the awesome opening series, and wasted a lot of free blood. The forestry environment and especially the camouflaged booby trap is delightfully spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper hit that is highly recommended to fans of the genre.
