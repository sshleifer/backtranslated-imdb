In a way, this movie reminds me of "Spring Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredding machine? Whoopi sunk sedatives? Whoopi as Blindlemoen and mimics Mick Jagger? Great moments are surely captured on film, but the movie is still so sucking, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man heard his wife sing for the first time. Post-Kitalian teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice from the bucket and in another scene he has a wonderful awake moment about his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe. But there's just the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to move. Only when ex-Go-gos' Charlotte Graffees The Graces makes a big pop song come up, the picture wakes up ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This photo is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep US South.
