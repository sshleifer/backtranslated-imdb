Frailty - 8/10 - This is a non-sensual title and 'Bill Paxton Directs' heading, it's a pretty good old-fashioned rip thrilling biblical horror thriller. Eventually, it could just be Kubrick's graceful southern Gothic cousin "The Shining" --- but hey, it's a pretty entertaining idea. It is also a doozy twist of a plot ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that will keep people from scratch at night on basic cable and fear the beejesus watching themselves. Too bad director Bill Paxton had to deal with the star himself ... oh .... still a good-looking devil.
