"The corner shop" is one of the great films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to James Stewart's and Margaret Sullavan's talents, it is filled with a tremendous film by top-of-the-line actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the kind of character actors that unfortunately Hollywood no longer employs. In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie Hollywood doesn't make anymore. (The creators of "You've Got Mail" claim their movie is a remake, but it's nothing more than a very excited self-prize.) Anyway, if you have a love for romantic comedies of the 1940s, you will find "The store around the corner" to be nothing too wonderful. Just as good with repeated views. Enjoy it!
