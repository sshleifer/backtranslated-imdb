I like to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like birds of prey because they are scary. My favorite parts are those where the raptor looks behind the pillar, as it reminds me of a scene from Friday the 13th movie with the girl eating the banana. <br /> <br /> I really love to watch this movie a lot because the computer graphics look a bit fake, but it's good, because as soon as you get into the movie, you hardly see what's going on and I think so has a good end, though I really don't understand what's going on on my first few views I've found out over time and that's the important part. The other important part is how terrifying the dinosaurs can be if you watch it for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST FILE.
