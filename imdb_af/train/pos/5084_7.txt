I was surprised that "The Secret Fury" was a nice movie ... Probably because I had no expectations for this movie. Although the movie does have the plot holes ..... I would say you couldn't guess who was behind the scheme until the end of the movie ..... Initially I thought it was Robert Ryan, use the same method, such as '' Gaslight '' where man tries to make his wife angry, but I was wrong. The biggest problem with the movie is that they are driving in a different direction, which at the beginning did not give any clues. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert behaved well ... ..... Plus, Vivian Vance, a fine character actor, stealing plays in this one ...... like movies, It keeps you guessing, like this ......
