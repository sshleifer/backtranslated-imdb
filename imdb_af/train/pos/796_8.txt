Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie's boss Tom Carper, the Governor was. That's why the Feds got involved, he called Clinton and asked him to get the Feds involved. I lived outside Philadelphia at the time, so the news was news every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and see the "City Confidential" segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A uber controller and a monster. He demanded to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she didn't want to do him anymore, he killed her the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money he's still living.
