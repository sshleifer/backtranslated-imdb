It's a very dramatic and exciting movie. There are many sites and turns. The story or the director questions the deadly or suspected crimes committed by black people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong show by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you like this one, don't miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
