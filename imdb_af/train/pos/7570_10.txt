I recently bought the many underrated Dreamcast and went to town to find some games to use. I bought Soul Calibur (a classic) and then I climbed over the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and have played Res Evil 3 several times, and I was impressed with them all, especially no.1 that must go down in history, has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them are approaching the dream attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it's just for the sake of buying a dream game for this game it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so surprised by a computer game as it encouraged me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story goes on from the 2nd story in which Claire Redfield is looking for her brother (Chris - from the 1st story), supposedly missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. Little is known about this corporation, except the fact that you have destroyed three previous stories. <br /> <br /> To help Claire, with Super Brat Steve's assistant, unlock the truth of the truth. location of your brother. The 2nd CD allows you to control Chris, that's when you get it so far without fearing the room. <br /> <br /> The control is very smooth and the movement of the characters is wonderfully realistic, when the character watches the danger, he / she faces in the direction he comes from. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I've given this game 10/10 because it's just the game of the year, the game of the decade and the best game in the world. Please buy this game as soon as possible.
