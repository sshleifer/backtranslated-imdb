It was "The Night HE Came Home," warning the posters of John Carpenter's career horror classic. In a small American town, Halloween centers around the murderer Michael Myers are trying to track down his sister Laurie Strode and, in the process, eradicate all her friends in rather brutal ways. They leave poor Laurie to fight the seemingly indestructible Michael. This plot off-line inspired numerous horror knock-offs in the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. The difference between them, and that, is simply that "Halloween" is the best. <br /> <br /> Made on a very modest, tight budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and grew the subgenre of "sexually debilitating teens passing through a knife / ax / chain saw / wielding psycho ".
