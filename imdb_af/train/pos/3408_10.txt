I give this movie an A + for the bare camp! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in her book on her mother: "If one sees the garden of Allah in the context of the high camp, it can be very amusing." And how! I happily laughed at the overcame score and the amazing, ridiculous, fantastic melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who have read the accounts of Boyer's toupee (it still remained in the heat) will snicker every time it looks. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines - Instead, they see dreamy in the distance, presumably their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most beneficial light (if you staring in a turkey, it may look good too!). Dietrich's costumes are outside this world. As Riva writes in her book, Dietrich has managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and design some of the most divine gowns, such as the Chiffon Beige Dress & Cape. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor. It is really hard to believe that the movie was done in 1936. The color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at the garden of Allah with an indulgent attitude and embrace his silliness, you can't help but enjoy it.
