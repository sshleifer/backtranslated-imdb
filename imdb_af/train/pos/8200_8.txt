Clint Eastwood certainly produced better movies than those, but this one does not. Dirty Harry gets everyone's attention and if anyone doesn't want to see romance, there's no reason you don't like him. He is cool because he is dirty. He is good because he kills without much thought. He is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen in movies in which Eastwood is acting, the character of the lead always captivates the audience. In White Hunter Black Heart, he is the crazy director. In "the line of fire" he is the "old" un, while here the "almost" unemployed with his work, that is, he does work for himself, does not care about a damn about his superiors practicing him for a holiday send out. <br /> <br /> Based on a victim of the rape, this movie is promising for all "non-sensible" movie-watchers. The movie has nothing to do with its central plot. However, what makes it slightly inferior to the better films of Eastwood is that although the character of the lead is captivating, the plot is not, as it is clear from the outset. It's not a movie that makes you sit in a place without moving. There are too many people much dirty than Dirty harry.
