I'll be honest. I made this movie so I could make it. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction can I have? The thing, however, is that the film (and its creators) have decided that it will not be pleasing. Instead, it will try its best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It came very close. A little less cheese in casual music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, incidents (such as props - like the Best Buy bag). Well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own. And the acting, writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than I expected. There is even a decent sense of humor, as two of our leaders debate how to decide whether a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints in everything) Almost constant curse, it can be a fun time at the movie. No, it's not good. Yes, it could have been better. But the makers, the actors, the crew, all tried to make a good movie (rather than a camp classic) and that is very important. The line of champion zombie films is a mile long, and thank you guys for not adding. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the Quiroz brothers. I'd love to see what they're doing next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
