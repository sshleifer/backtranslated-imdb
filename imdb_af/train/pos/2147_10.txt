I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. The reality of long train commuters, cyclists from the train station, soup steps and other typical scenes so well portrayed knows my certainty for this movie I really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life painted in this film with bright colors, but you don't have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Director Suo's tricks were mostly subtle; I got his character, called Tamako Tamura, with a soft filter, which makes her sublime, a little confronted, but most tricks were so soft that I completely pulled in and danced with his characters. Or cry. Or laugh out loud. Great. A +.
