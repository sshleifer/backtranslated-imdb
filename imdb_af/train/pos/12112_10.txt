The premise of this anime series is about bread, from all things to base a plot! I really laughed. The main character has a special bread power with which he was born, and he goes to the bakery school. I wish it was available on DVD, and it doesn't matter whether it is underwritten or baptized - it's so good. Even the theme song alone is funny. At one point in the theme song, there is an Afro-Japanese man with an afro to horse, wearing a French baguette, as if it were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense unless you see the anime. You will laugh until your sides hurt. This is definitely the most unique anime I've seen so far.
