As a child I thought this movie was wonderful. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for various reasons. It has well-trained animals that are placed through various stunts and scenes that look great on camera. It has a beautiful, well-written musical that fits perfectly with the scenes, with fast melodies and the heartbreaking main theme, which still makes me cry. Even when people are moody. And it has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on a book, it is the story of three domestic animals, an intelligent, confident and substantial paternal lab called Shadow, a witty and in vain - but still a clever cat with a fear for the water called Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family gets away. The pets are missing and worried, and are planning a trip across the Sierra Mountains to travel their lives. An incredible journey. So what, maybe the house is just over that mountain. But what if it isn't? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound to people who, like the three great actors, offer the voices for the main characters, and for anyone else ... yes, everyone is going to watch it.
