It's a fantasy movie for kids based on the Boggy Creek Legend, although I don't know why they call it. Back to Boggy Creek as if it were a successor. This movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie prize. Dawn Wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost with 2 other men in the bog around Boggy Creek and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it is very stupid and the plot is granular, but this type of movie is perfect for the 8-12 y / o group it has targeted. It's harmless G-rated kiddie fare and you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they see it. Strictly for the 8-12 y / o set, older kids will be bored and think it's paralyzed.
