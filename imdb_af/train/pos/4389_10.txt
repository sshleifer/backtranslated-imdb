From the excellent play of an extremely impressive role-player, to the intelligently written (and highly quotable) script, from the cute cinematography to the beautiful music show by Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity in movie shows: one that is almost impossible to find place error in any area. <br /> <br /> Several comparisons were made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. Thanks to Mel Gibson, Braveheart got me too much from a self-confident and preaching epic to Rob Roy as the kind of movie I'd love to see more than once. While Braveheart is working hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy just grabs you and absorbs it in his tightly crafted storytelling. Not a single scene was wasted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic excitement, action and even occasional humor. The characters are well portrayed, translating perfectly and ways that anchor them in their authentic period. <br /> <br /> Also, they are not caricatures of good and evil as we often see in even modern film. . <br /> <br /> For example, while we hope that heroic Rob Roy prevails, we realize that his preachers are products of his own pride and honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful guys in the history of the theater, but there are moments when we can understand how his life's events shaped him to become what he is. Rob Roy has a level of character development that makes his story even more credible and engaging. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a wonderful treasure, with one of the biggest sword battles ever choreographed and a climate worthy of all timely anticipation.
