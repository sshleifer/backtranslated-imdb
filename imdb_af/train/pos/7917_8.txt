After reading the other clumsy reviews and comments, I felt I had to bat for this movie. <br /> <br /> Rye's movies tend to do little to one another and expect this one to be if one of you likes is probably out of the point. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a thoughtful and unashamed look at religious beliefs. The only other movie like it - in terms of its religious message - should be Tolkin's "The Rapture". <br /> <br /> I'm surprised anyone can say the story is confused or supernatural. This is a simple film about Catholic faith, miracles and salvation - though you will never guess it to the end. It's also the only movie I can think of whose resolution literally spins on a pun. <br /> <br /> As a (happy) Catholic myself, I know what the movie is about and I find some kind of love in his ultimate innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the type of theology on which the film is based, then it goes right over your head. <br /> <br /> As a movie - unlike a story of "Awesome Heaven," it's not groundbreaking. While "The Rapture" is heavy with visual meaning and movies, "Cold Heaven" is showing its own film quality. There are no striking shots, no edgy effects, no efforts to adjust the content to the shape. It's real shooting, but muted. It also does not have a dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. It's a simple story that simply unfolds. It may seem strange; but in the end the mystery is revealed. It seems ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity disappears in an attempt by Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this regard, "Cold Heaven" has exactly the same thing as a movie such as "The Sting," or "The Sixth Sense" or "Final Descent" or Polanski's A Pure Formality. "All these are movies with a trick around their sleeves. They can frustrate you on the road, but they have a point - an obvious one - but the fun is at least partial to take. <br /> <br /> Even though it looks a little more than a rough dog story with a punch line, it's worth looking for the way it regulates and deceives you. Try it - especially if you were a Catholic, or ever.
