Mr. Jim is another case to express the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a refreshing entertainment that almost stops breathing. It is so useless to look for historical accuracy here, as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade. It's pure hokum with all the points pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and a real sense of energy given Raoul Walsh's lively direction. Flynn is still aware of his powers (you will never guess he had a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and eternal sidekick Alan Hale, over time, as Flynn's dad Jack Carson is taking a one-day duty this time. Indeed, even Flynn's former pirate's movies have come a bit to get rid of cameo in a cockpit! The 103 minutes only breeze.
