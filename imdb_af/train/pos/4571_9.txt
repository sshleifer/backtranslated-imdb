The most important aspect of this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, Guinea's artist and fighter who has defeated the odds despite her physical condition. As a person working with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was shockingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy has formed forms his family, low-income, workers-Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this photo portrayed this support. The book didn't read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's spiritual arrogant personality. . I recommend this movie to everyone, especially for classic movie lovers.
