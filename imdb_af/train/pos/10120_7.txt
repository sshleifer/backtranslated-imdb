The movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is murdered, one Tatsuhito becomes involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get very fast. <br /> <br /> A previous work by Miike's Shinjuku Triad Society is still packed with its usual ol-ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, but it's not one of its more eclectic or flamboyant pieces. On the contrary, it is a fairly well-crafted little pulp fiction, as Tatsuhito digs his way through the subterranean, a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who obtains illegal organs from Taiwan and an almost brothel of young boys (one especially the character killing the police at the start). Tatsuhito's brother becomes involved with society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and use the same violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate this fierce empire. <br /> <br /> What is particularly interesting about this little work is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later returned to Japan and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who has been alienated in China, killing his father and developing a crime wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprising Shakespearian character, strangely enough, much less that you're actually starting to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate confrontation with Tatsuhito comes. And Tatsuhito himself is a similar tragic figure if he is forced to fight with his lack of ability to control his brother. Although it would be rude to say that Miike's movies are mostly successful at their shocking value, it is sometimes easy to trace how well Miike can create bitter, unreliable characters. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
