I believe it is the most powerful movie that made HBO Pictures to date. This movie had to be released in the theaters so the audience could see on the big screen. It is available on video, make sure you search and watch it. Chris Gerolmo did a good job with the direction and the script. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of the genre.
