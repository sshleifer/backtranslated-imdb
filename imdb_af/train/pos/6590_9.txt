Intelligent, furious and exciting, "The Invisible Man" exhibited in 2000 under the regular series of Sci-Fi, which balances the "Farscape "'s fantastic artistic and sometimes melodramatic essay with keen, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The performance was set between the "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility meter, but the characters of "I-Man" did not deny. Even predictable characters, such as the Keeper, the Official and Eberts, have been given the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and moved, made even more remarkable by the revolving door of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science has sometimes only fallen into the incredible way. The show's low points are still entertaining, and I've never seen such tough pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised, and fans have the right to claim a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I come across a Hercules marathon: The Legendary Journeys on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, with the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that represented the invisible man and his ilk.
