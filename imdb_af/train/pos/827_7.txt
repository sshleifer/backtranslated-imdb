Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", claims and counter-claims of how Episode II and III will be possible, the "original" Star Wars movies have played the role. This makes them part of a coherent whole, rather than separating the older and new films into separate trilogies. What the new movies have done, puts new perspectives on the older movies. This new outlook allows us to appreciate more often what was considered the worst of the original trilogy: "Return of the Jedi". ROTJ is often as strong as the original and just slightly less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Strikes Back". Indeed, the "cute" element of ROTJ, the Ewoks, remains a weak link throughout the range. Did George Lucas expose the furious midgets in the film to the merchandising possibilities? Only he can answer that question. <br /> <br /> This cute factor aside, the movie is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga. Following the conclusion of "The Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his friends from Rebel Alliance to Tatooine, his home ground, to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford). The space pirate became Rebel hero caught by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debt. <br /> <br /> Skywalker has been a changed man since he left Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil empire. Now everything became black, Luke's discovery of his origin confused and torn him. His psychological makeup is not as strong as his outward appearance. While aiming to always support his Rebel friends, he again wants another chance to re-confront evil Darth Vader despite his concern about whether he will destroy or eventually turn to the Dark Side and at the emperor joins the Father. <br /> Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's camp, to its swing palace and the "almighty Sarlac" - an intense stint living in the sand. Lucas' CGI film expansions in 1997 significantly exacerbated the overall impact of the Sarlac, and it looks fake and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The combat scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. Luke is almost one-handed to Jabba and his loved ones, proving his skill as Jedi is almost complete. <br /> <br /> When Lukas returns to the Degobah system to visit the nasty Yoda again, the viewer is lowered by Yoda's clear lack of screen time. Undoubtedly, the star of "The Empire Strikes Back", Yoda is all but the story, as the progression of Luke's fate is spelled out on the screen. ROTJ is really Luke's movie, maybe even more so than the original. His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. The other Rebel characters definitely work in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is anything but non-existent, unlike the "Empire". In fact, only Leia's character has been developed in ROTJ. Solo's character seems to fade, as the facets of his personality in the first two films became known. <br /> <br /> Their roles are sent to work with the Rebels to destroy a new Doodster that is near completion. This time the Emperor himself oversees the final stages of construction. The Empire wants the Rebellion once in love, while the Emperor himself plans to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side, next door (or replace it?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is another kind of evil for this movie, less cunning than governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) of "Star Wars", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. The writer is brilliantly played by Ian McDiarmid, and the Emperor is just one of those characters you'd like to hate. <br /> <br /> All the other actors are well established in their roles. Hamill surprises as the more proven Luke, who makes his character's progress from bright teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior is one of the few real character developments of the series. Ford's role is thin, as all his charm and charisma were spent in the first two films - he was the true star of the first film. Fisher's Leia is more of a prop, at least at the end of the movie where she learns about herself that she was never sure. Add in favorites such as Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the lovely Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series looks like a family more than a cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the film's corny forest battle for the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three-battle series: on Endor, in space and on Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. The music, as always, is brilliant and keeps the mood perfect in every case. Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for 2001, a Space Odyssey, John Williams' score is so much part of the Star Wars folklore as light sabers and the Force. <br /> <br /> Lucas left The end is open for interpretation, meaning there could be more episodes. Indeed, sci-fi fans have created their own versions of episodes VII, VIII and IX over and over. ROTJ works when given a chance, and beautiful, cute animals are a good finish for the series. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes are seen together, this saga can be the best ever made. Is this already? Adding Episode I changed the landscape of the series. That is why "Return of the Jedi" can now be seen in a different light and a whole new appreciation given almost 20 years after its release.
