Finally, a movie where the audience guesses at the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) are going down to destruction since where they are going, but we don't know how or when to the end of the movie. Hoffman is excellent, as usual, and even Hawke was kind of like the younger brother who basically does what he tells, since he really can't think for himself. Hawke might have been a bit out of his element, but he played the part well enough. Add to this mix Andy's wife, perfectly played by Marisa Tomei, cheating with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addiction; and a father who finally knows exactly what the day of the robbery happened. This movie will make you think.
