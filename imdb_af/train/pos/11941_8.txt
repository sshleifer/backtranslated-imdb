They do not frighten journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday" or the witty detective William Powell and sabotarian wife Myrna Loy of Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in Scoop. Their screwball repartee is more post-modern than Post Depression, Allen's writing filled with ironic rebirth and common old New York anxiety. Shades of the old white rarely occur, such as when he, like Sid, the Great Splendini wizard, reacts over his background: "I was born in the Hebrew persuasion, but when I got older I turned to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, is becoming a relatively good, sometimes quirky journalism student caught in a London-capable murder. A serial killer. The plot is a review of its recent London-based thriller Match Point, up to the upper class sins and the "American Tragedy" / Sunbathe "accident." In fact, Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose from Cairo to name just a few other examples. I don't care if he works; I would like the new material to be at least the same as the original, and unfortunately, it's just a reflection of his younger greatness. <br /> <br /> Allen as director and actor can't hide his love for The actress, as he couldn't do for Diane Keaton, therefore takes a middle-class comedy in a suitable place in the Allen canon, not big not, but amusing. Sometimes it is brilliant satirics. About the suspected top killer, Sid (Allen), "I'll be very surprised if he killed one person." This is vintage Allen humor. While there is hardly a clear literary touch as in most of his films, he lets Scoop with music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss let us know that the Woodman did not lose his class to the class.
