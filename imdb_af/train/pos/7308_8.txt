With a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, it was the horror movie it all started. John Carpenter brings a nail-bite nightmare on the Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, plays the role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun, just off roads with a relentless psychopath cross the hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from a nearby mad asylum. He had his sister fifteen years earlier. He is now back in Haddonfield, the sleeping Illinois town where his murder took place. As he looks at Laurie's eyes after she begins to fall into a parcel to the deserted house where he lived, he starts stalking and terrorizing her, and frightens her night when he picks someone in his way to to come to her. br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and lighting make this moody horror flick scary ... with the long gloomy shots, it feels as if you are being stalked by the manic serial killer. Myers are well hidden until fully revealed by the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is definitely outdated, it's not cold at all. The idea is merely a gambling clash, and this little shocker is one of the best known and memorable horror movies ever made to this day. It has grown seven successors and eventually Rob Zombie's equally terrifying remake, and set a new standard for horror. what still exists today.
