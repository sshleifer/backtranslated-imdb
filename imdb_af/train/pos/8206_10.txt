Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th movie of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still has it, Harry said he had to have a holiday after some trouble that happened as a result of a robbery (where the unforgettable "Make My Day" catch come from!) But the city he took was worse, a woman attacked vigilants after a rape in a funfair and started to get the punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An Enhancement to The Enforcer which was a bit more comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles best known for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Keep a watch if you like Clint Eastwood, the Dirty Harry movies or action addicts.
