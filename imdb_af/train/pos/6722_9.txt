Everyone has already commented on cinematography (good to big), the personalities (greater than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to culture over time). What is missed is a greater issue of sociological importance: a mainstream American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We watched 16mm movies at the local high schools in SoCal. I remember the whole feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, set a Hawaiian shirt and shorts on fire and watched the latest surfing movie at night. Often the narrator was the filmmaker himself, and read a scrap of sheets of paper. Sometimes a surfband or proto-punk band will add music. I was never happier. Except for inciting and hollering, 'Riding Giants' brought me back. <br /> <br /> It also brought a sense of living life to the brink, not worried about the money and the social and corporate climb learning, don't stop the Joneses, push yourself physically and mentally for a brief moment of joy and rejoicing - can be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us brave enough or honest with ourselves enough to strive for: live on our own terms alone. Perhaps society will fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people actually living their dreams. <br /> <br /> It was this message that really impressed me.
