I was a fan of the book since the third grade, so of course I watched the movie, read the sequel and then watched the television program. It was in itself a good performance, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from a girl who has a first addition to the book. But afterwards, I decided to try it again and ignored the book (similar to what you did with the Harry Potter movies). I found the series wonderful! It was clean cut and something everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy to let everyone go. It's really enjoyable! Clean and Wonderful!
