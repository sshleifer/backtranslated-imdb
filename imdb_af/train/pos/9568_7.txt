Some comments here on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III movies of the 90's, but while it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very indifferent, this film of Pou-Soi Cheang is not really sloppy, scary or sensational enough to deserve that equation. But it's still a punch that makes it a watch, especially when eager, hard-faced action is your thing. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit traveling to Hong Kong after killing the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai, the relentless policeman who is determined to find him, whatever the cost. With Wai reaching his goal, Pang will stop nothing to secure his escape until he meets Yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse. <br /> <br /> An unrelentingly hard drama with great cinematography, incredible sound design, a ghost show and solid performances by Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hardy Asian hyper violence. along the lines of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy). Stumps, shootings, ruthless knocks: everything happens regularly in this movie and is unquestionably captured by director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the kind of story meant to make an unfortunate end to everyone involved, and certainly enough, pretty much everyone in this movie dies (rather nasty deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in his last moments Dog Bite Dog exceeds it. In a lower-over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are closed while a pregnant Yue watches. Eventually, after all three heavy stab wounds suffered during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean (a now dead) Yue, which delivers their baby moments before he dies. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not be a "classic" cut of Hong Kong remains, with its delirious OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth looking out for.
