This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview Jackie said it was his favorite too. It features some amazing stunts and jigsaws as well as some very funny scenes. This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire. He was also raised in Tango and Cash, which used the opening styles. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong. The story immediately jumps into a fantastic race through a shanty town and continues as Jackie slides a hill and jumps on a moving bus to catch the evil Ku. Who is one of the biggest villains in any Jackie Chan movie. very funny scenes, as Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect Ku's secretary, who has enough information to pick him up, but even that causes a lot of trouble. Jackie is at his absolute best here. The last battle scene at the mall is my favorite battle scene by anyone. It was the most intense fight I ever saw, Jackie, and climaxed in a slide next to a pole under the explosive lights. All in all, one of his biggest stunts he ever did, cut off his skin with his hands. He was fortunate that he was not electrolyzed, as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of lower voltage. <br /> <br /> All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of its best movies. By the end of this movie, you could say he didn't hold anything back and didn't do his stuntmen either. So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie, and no one would assure them anymore. Jackie himself had to take responsibility. There are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - this is a real life action that is a surprise to watch. It is this kind of action that makes him the phenomenon he is and it's a movie that surprises people 100 years of the day. If you haven't seen this movie and a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general, give yourself a surprise and watch this movie. It's really sensational.
