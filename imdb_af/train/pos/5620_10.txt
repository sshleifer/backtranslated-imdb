Roman Polanski is considered one of the most important directors of our time, as the idea behind classics such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". Probably what makes Polanski's theater a very interesting one is that he is able to create commercially attractive films, such as the aforementioned masterpieces, and also loves making key games of a more personal nature. "Le Locataire", or "The Tenant", is one of those movies; a terrifying story about paranoia and obsession among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done. <br /> <br /> Polanski himself plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, tried to kill herself by jumping out of the window. After Simone died of injuries, Trelkovsky began to become obsessed with her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building. <br /> <br /> While feeling the same claustrophobic feeling of his other "flat-themed" films ("Repulsion & Rosemary's Baby"), this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in Trelkovsky's head. not, the catastrophic consequences of the paranoia in his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky's precipitation in the darkness is perfectly portrayed by Polanski, although his appearance only odd and timid Looks like Polanski seems to act like that because Trelkovsky is meant to act in this way, as a simplified, almost no life, inhabiting himself in this elusive sub-world inhabited by a collection of bizarre people. the people in the building really gave the people memorable characters is very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> The beautiful film art that Polanski uses in the film also helps to keep the feeling of isolation. increase and give life to the beautiful building that serves as a cage for Trelkovsky. . The haunting images Polanski uses to convey the sense of confusion and madness of a supernatural beauty that makes them frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake in the movie, it is definitely a little slow at first. It may look like a turn-off, but the slow pace of the start works perfectly, as it mimics Trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters another kingdom. Also, the winding story is certainly not an easy one to understand because of the very complex layers it has. But more than a mistake, it is a joy to include a thoughtful plot like this one. <br /> <br /> While "The Tenant" may not be for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be happy with the experience. "Le Locataire" is actually one of Roman Polanksi's masterpieces. 10/10
