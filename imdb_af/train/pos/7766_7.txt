After playing a nymphomania in WRITE ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally played goodbye to her sweet sister and wife role and demonstrated the ability to play mantraps with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame play the same kind of tramps - and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone has won a best supporting actress Oscar. <br /> <br /> The film she's in is not entirely up to Oscar standards. but it is a strong enough melodrama under Douglas Sirk's capable hands. There is an almost noirish look at the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as its headline. <br /> <br /> Heads of the rich family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama, with the emphasis on strong supportive players, Stack and Malone. Both get the opportunity with both hands and Stack must also be awarded for his good work as the poor alcoholic brother driven by his own wild motives to despair. <br /> <br /> The nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do so with their usual skill and beliefs - Hudson and Bacall. They play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is especially noticeable (as is usually the case in a Sirk film) and yet it does not prevent me from thinking of the movie as a Technicolor film noir in the ear of BELIEVE HERE FOR HEAVEN. <br /> <br /> Worth watching with some interesting performances of the whole role.
