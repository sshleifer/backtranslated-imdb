Presentation Lily Mars is a very enjoyable little film showing the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland, along with her standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars who joined to producer John Thornway for her big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is awesome in this role!
