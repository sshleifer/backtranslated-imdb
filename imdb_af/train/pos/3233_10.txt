This is a top Finnish movie this year, although Tango Kabaree comes close. Director Lampela made years ago a nice little film, Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista. I was in love with a desperate woman. Joki is truly true. beautiful movie of one Saturday afternoon in a small town. The actors may not be as beautiful or beautiful, but they do beautiful performances. I certainly hope that many of their JUSSI (Finnish OSCAR) image will get next spring. I think this movie can make it abroad.
