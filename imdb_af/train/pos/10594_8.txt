Passport to Pimlico is a great surprise to all fans of the British film. Not only is it a pleasant and entertaining comedy, but it is a movie-like flashback to an early age. Unfortunately, with attitudes and scenarios, this is just a reminder of British life. Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton, who after the accidental explosion of an unexploded bomb discovered a wealth of medieval treasures of the 14th-century Duke of Burgundy, which has been buried deep under their small suburban street for the past 600 years. <br /> <br /> Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal declaration signed by King Edward IV of England (who has never been officially abolished) to declare that that particular London street was declared Burgundy land, meaning that Pemberton and the other locals in the eyes of international law are no longer British subjects, but natives of Burgundy and their small street are an independent country in its own right and a law for itself. <br /> <br /> It puts the war-like and impoverished resume well if they believe they are out of English law and jurisdiction, so in an act of drunken challenge they burn their ration books, destroy and ignore their clothing cards, ignore British license laws, etc., and declare themselves completely independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> But what happens is, ever, muscle, black marketer, and dishonest rascal follower and cross the "border" in Burgundy as a refuge from law and post-war restrictions to sell their turbulent goods . And half of London's consumers follow them to evade the ration, to make their silence happy little harbor, a pit of thieves and a pretty proud one. <br /> <br /> Calling for Whitehall for help, they said it was "a matter of foreign policy now, which is reluctant to engage its Majesty's government" due to developments. Residents leave high and dry. However, they declare the area a legal border and thereby set up a fully-equipped customs office at the end of the road, primarily to monitor smuggling than to provide any security for the residents of Pimlico. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the border is completely closed and starts with a large siege, with the residents of the Bugundia running slowly out of water and food, but never less in the right British style. Like one Bugundian resident quotes, "we are English and we were always English, and that's just because we are English, we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians." <br /> <br /> A sentiment soon coming to the capital as the rest of London learns about the poor Bugundian fate, makes them all compelled to chop and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blocks . <br /> <br /> Fighted by Whitehall, invaders have been able to get their hands on this new bundle of foreigners over the centuries, especially since this English is English! <br /> <br /> Great story, and lots of fun throughout. Not to be missed.
