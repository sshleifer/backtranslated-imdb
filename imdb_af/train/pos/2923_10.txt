Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at this high school performance show. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of The Honeymooners, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also funny. I saw it for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard, I almost fell off my chair. I still think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on Saturday Night Live, made me laugh so hard, he is one of the best people coming from Saturday Night Live. Eddie Murphy Delirious is his best performance alongside "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 inches and 10/10 stars.
