My parents took me when I was nine years old. I never forgot it. I have never seen as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she made Elephant Walk.) Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings aren't sexual. I just couldn't see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy, staring at her. She began to show her age (she is nearly seventy-four), but I still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women ever. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie a few times. since, and it's a juicy melodrama. What saves it is, of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, beautiful scenery, the impressive elephant climbs and a well-made point of human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> All in all, spending a few hours watching the movie channel or renting a video.
