In my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. It really put things in perspective while I watched them. Although it is fit, this film is about something that can happen to your children. <br /> <br /> It shows how easy two children can hide their hatred for their school and their plans to kill innocent students. This movie wouldn't work in any other format. They pulled off the camera perfectly. This reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Cellar Tires. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fictional version of our dreams come true. We get the child behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it hasn't done well on the market, and few people even know it existed. If it had a single preview on a single block film, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal is about, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I believe it's the best movie adaptation of a school shoot of the few who really tried it. The shooting itself takes only about ten minutes of the hour and half a long film, as it focuses mainly on Cal and Andr√©, and what they did up to that point. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, rent it and watch it. I guarantee that when it's finished, you'll be speechless.
