Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen and it's a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh !! I watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it, I still have brand new fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you have to look it several times to hear all the jokes because you will laugh so much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is hilarious! <br /> <br /> Although there are many funny comedians there - after watching this rise-comedy, most of them look like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it before - get it, look it - and you'll love it !! It will make you bigger !!! :-)
