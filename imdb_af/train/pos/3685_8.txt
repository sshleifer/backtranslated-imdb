It's just such a joy to watch this plot project. So refreshing and educating. Not only for a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved within 5 minutes of screen time, but also as an audience, which may not be so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are all unique, but some, as expected, stand out. I thought the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment was the best, although the mime made me smile inside. <br /> <br /> I watched the "spoilers" option for this review bus, unfortunately ... what you read is a spoiler enough. Just look at it. Don't read what I'm writing, but rather look at the movie. <br /> <br /> Smile.
