Definitely a very good idea, script was just OK. Could have been better. The positive is that it doesn't make you feel like you're an adventure lover. A new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. Negative is that I personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than that. They had to end up with a better adventure than this. It was not bad at all, but it would have been much better with a few more runtime.Njoyed it a lot though Cant said it was boring or not good. A good one for those who love adventure animations like Sindbad like the road to El Dorado. This movie is also recommended for people looking for a fun adventure with a very happy ending.
