I watched this movie when I was almost a kid, and of course it was moved by tears through this story of a jackal family. The wonderful landscape in Hokkaid√¥, the excellent storytelling and finally the wonderful soundtrack, offers a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers, it can be helpful to know that DEFA dubbing is the only thing worth listening to. I packed both (DEFA and BR), but I just watch the first one.
