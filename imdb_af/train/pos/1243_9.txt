Every time Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a movie like the Golden Child, especially. It's a movie you want to figure out, maybe Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone. But Eddie really works; He's smart, he's funny, he's brave, friendly, polite, sparing, clean and everything a hero has to be. <br /> <br /> Having been chosen to protect a mystical child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (fulfilled perfectly by Dance), Eddie goes from California, to Nepal and back, while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he is all he says he is and knows a crazy old, holy man (Wong, perfect as always) that he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, breathtaking in places, shocking and of course funny. Eddie is the only action hero, I know who can start a movie by making rude comments behind a guy reading a porn magazine, and ending with clever aleck remarks about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this child ": it's a" Golden "find. <br /> <br /> Nine stars Viva Nepal!
