Animation always seems to be freaky. In Japan this may not be the case, but in Europe and more so in the US, animation has a big fat "KIDS" tag on it. France is probably one of the more comic liberal countries, home to classic Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon, and so on. If you've never read it before, it's not too late. There is no upper limit on them and they do not carry the nerd-stigma of DC or Marvel. Of course, it looks like a movie that appears in France. It fits my biased image of the French as art-loving, anti-US-oriented and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also a scanner dark out there to suppress that view - art looks very international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have gathered, Renaissance is art and French. If you are a normal person, you will be afraid of this. However, there is no need! Underneath it is cool, sleek, self-colored appearance, there is a good excitement and a good movie overall. <br /> <br /> This was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy to make the spectacular animation to a gimmick, like Sony and C: o do with their Pixar rip-offs. I didn't expect a confusing, sometimes boring and not very pleasant movie, but luckily I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would both enjoy it for the neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worth it at that level as well. PLEASE NOTE: I saw the French who was OK, as far as I could see. English can be more interesting with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> A last word of praise for the animation. It was incredible. Futuristic, well-crafted, nice camera work, smart solutions (Eyes, for example, look very good, what's hard to do) and so visually amazing, I felt like eruption. "It's so damn impressive!" Then again, I really like animation and I appreciate the effort made by the studio, so my verdict is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> Good movie anyway, definitely live outside it is a "gimmick".
