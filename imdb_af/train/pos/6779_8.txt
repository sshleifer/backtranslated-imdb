George Cukor is a breeding and cynical classic. The distinctive Ronald Coleman is at best in this piece of Noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles. Award-winning Anthony John (Colman) has driven his wife, Brita (Signe Hasso), with his haughty temper and volatile behavior. But the two can continue to work together to please their audiences. Things are starting to change as John gets bored with his career; he agrees with reluctance to play Othello. He becomes deep in character as a jealous and murderous man. He began with a thin line between illusion and reality and ended up confusing his role with his own life and eventually killing his mistress (Shelley Winters) but had no remembrance of the deadly act. <br /> <br /> Colman looks flawless in this role. Winters are very impressive, as the young woman is determined to get away from her uncomfortable life. Also in the movie: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
