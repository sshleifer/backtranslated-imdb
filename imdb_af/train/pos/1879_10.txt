I was too young to remmeber when I first saw. But I saw it for the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me to see it. Now my whole family memorized it. We pick it up at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I'm still laughing at all this time. Certainly, it's about a really drunk million that is irresponsible. The whole point is that he still lost humanity in the other we see in the movie. And he is prepared to give it all for love. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to laugh. Lots of laughs. His hallaric, sweet, and if you're a movie buff, it will really change your idea of ​​"Funny". Watch it with a group of your friends or family and I promise you will never talk about anything again, with some Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to find a movie in my family that everyone likes. But this movie I feel made us closer. And I know it will do the same for you!
