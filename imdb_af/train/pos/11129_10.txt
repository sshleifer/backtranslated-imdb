I didn't think so at all, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was a gay porn. At that stage, all I knew about it was the reference to the Seinfeld episode with Jerry, trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer's all sick and nosebleed. <br /> <br /> The movie was wonderful, and surprisingly optimistic and not spicy pretentious, like some movies I can't even remember, because they're all crap. <br /> <br /> The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck to New York trying to be a hustler (a male prostitute, basically), thinking it would be easy to choose just to hit the stone wall when a woman stops hitting HIM and charging him for their sexual encounter. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, the so-called "Ratso" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all day. You think of him as a crook, but a lovely one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the film is so sweet and heartwarming that they are friendlier and so and so. Rizzo reveals himself as a sad, sad man who is very sick and very depressed and self-conscious. He hates Ratso and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems are solved. and he will learn to be a cook and be known. <br /> <br /> It's heart-warming to watch Joe do everything he can to get them both to Florida, along with many hilarious moments (as Ratso tries to steal food at that hippie party and gets caught by the woman who says, "Give, well, you know it's free. You don't have to steal it." And he said, "Well, if it's free, then I'm not stealing" it "and that classic moment totally indescribable and unscheduled where Hoffman almost touches that taxi and screams: "Hey, I'm here! I'm here!") and the play is so credible, you "I will never believe, Joe Buck will grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo will grow up to be the legendary and beloved Dustin. Hoffman. It's not the first time they've worked together in leading roles, but chemistry is so thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sad part I believe is quite an over-understanding to call it "depressed". Ratso Rizzo is all out in the movie, barely walking, barely eating, coughing, sick and reaching a bus on the way to Florida. He hurts badly, and only miles away from Miami, he finally ends up on the bus. The bus driver assures everyone that nothing is wrong and continues. Sad, but not in the way that makes you go home and cry and run around like you've lost your 13-year-old dog. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie. And the soundtrack is pretty much just about playing "Everybody's Talking" at the right time, a strange move, but a great thing, because the song is good and fits perfectly into the scene of the movie. , go buy it
