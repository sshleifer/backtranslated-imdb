The power of the Kangwon province is the second feature of Hong Sang-Soo's director, and much of what he has started in his previous film footage in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case two) and stories of upset or upset relationships, as well as a powerful dose of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that was clearly reduced from his previous work is the flight of fancy that included elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a single moment of surrealism which finds a contrast to the otherwise fairly realistic depiction therein. The two stories follow a young woman who goes with her friends to the Kangwon province, just to move to a stranger, the second about a man who also goes with his girlfriend to the Kangwon province and struggles with his relationship misery. <br /> <br /> Again, Hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature, yet I don't think he is completely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters and just draws enough compassion to set off The criticism he has with his irony. I think the idea that I came across Hong's movies is that they feel just as real, especially the complex and confronted characters. Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but that these characters are present and the actors are fully developed and credible. <br /> <br /> It's not a fast movie. There is very deadly and like the previous movie, things are not always immediately linked, so patience is paid and in surprising ways. There seems to be no element of the film that has not been deliberately put into the film and it has made me a little hyper-conscious of several seemingly extra characters, as they are dragged into the mix as the film progresses. <Br /> <br /> Power is an excellent film that successfully spits, regrets, a level of personal emotion that longs for a story that highlights irony and the flaw of human decision making. It's a very difficult balance to keep and it's amazing how Hong managed to pull it off twice in a row. Technical production values ​​have become much better since the first film and direction have become solid and clear. This film does not tackle the same emotional wheeze for the first time, but gets a lot in its assured exploration and refinement really helps the overall vision. Great view for artificial cinema lovers. 8/10.
