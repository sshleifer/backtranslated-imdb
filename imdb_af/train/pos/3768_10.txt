I realize that many people hate this movie, but I have to admit it is one of my favorites. I like to keep it better then it's a predecessor and happy to keep it better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First, I think people never give the story credit, much like Back to the Future, Time Travel is hard to write, and in this movie they included Time Travel and a Spiritual Journey . <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were the best performers in this movie, they looked cooler, acted cooler, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The set design of this movie is also cute. The sets are sometimes fairly detailed and massive and it can be hard to believe that these sets are made for a movie about two teenage buds that can hardly play ... but this is not the genius of the entire franchise, which these two idiots make bigger than the life characters responsible for the entire utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume design was awsome too. Bill and Ted actually look nice in Bogus Journey, where, as in Excellent Adventure they prefer, as they would put it, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this movie is cute, the score especially. There is so much I can say about this movie because I love it. But this is one of those movies I grew up with and each time I enjoyed it more, so I can understand why people hate or just think of his Bogus compared to Excellent Adventure. (<br /> <br /> START YOUR BATH SELF !!
