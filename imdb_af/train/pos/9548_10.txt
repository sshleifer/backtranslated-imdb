It's an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Great work by Gokbakar brothers. First, I want to show on the screen. General screenplay in most movies from Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best shots to be perfect. And also the transition parts are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a good topic that affects everyone. Especially a woman who wants a psychiatrist in a sanatorium has a mother who is a common insanity. Main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you have to do is combine all the tips. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive aggression part played by Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar. This performance can be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll be confused"
