Although structured completely different from the book by Tim Krabb√©, who wrote the original 'The Vanishing' (Spoorloos), it felt the same overall, except that Koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyrical. The beginning is good, the drug is good, but the sting is in the end. A surprising emotional end. As you can read in several magazines, there is sex in the movie, but it is very beautiful. Never explicit, but with a lot of warmth and sometimes even humor. It's a pity American movies can't be as honest as this one. Where Dutch films tend to be just over the edge, 'De Grot' is always within the bounds of good taste. 'De Grot' tells a wonderful story in over 30 years. If you leave the cinema, you will be moved. What can we ask more about a movie? Anyway, this movie gives even more ....
