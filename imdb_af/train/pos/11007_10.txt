Jeremy Northam's characterization of the stuttering, softened book-like Morgan Sullivan and watching him lose pieces of his true identity under the influence of single-moth dish and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. She offered her a cigarette at the bar. It is an old habit, without thinking or even asking, and is lost in her face, neck and lips. No matter the brainwashing, love has a way of being persistent. Love can also not be washed in with a two of his two false women in a brain. In gradual stages he gets rid of his glasses, walks and talks and even his face looks different from what the movie The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriate.The extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes it almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers, and I would like to see more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's depiction, when she sees him in his various extinct states, the man she loves and for whom she performs a mission on the basis of blind faith, some vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would make it less One dimensional show made by her, she's just not a game for Northam's talents, but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would love to know about other scripts written by the same author.
