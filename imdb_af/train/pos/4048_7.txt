Rohmer shrinks from his usual French middle class portraits to tell these costume drama about the problems of an aristocrat lady during the French Revolution. What is more appealing about "La Anglaise ..." (besides the story itself) is the wonderful aesthetics Rohmer has achieved. The images are digitally decorated to make them look like baroque photos. In some moments you can't really tell if you're watching a movie or a series of photos in Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like an art. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
