A Classic Hollywood Biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro both give spectacular sincere performances in the two main roles, and the supporting role-play is uniformly excellent, with performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "nit" I can choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and distracting (not her performance that was good, it was just that the movie was two unnecessary scenes to play her role). . <br /> In addition, the characteristics, dynamics and action of the real story are never and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and how they experience develop their creatures, and are uniquely characterized by the performing artists. Despite the film's extreme length, the pacing stays completely completely. The score is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> Is this a predictable Hollywood movie? You bet. So, Mike Leigh's addicts must pull a star, but everyone must be very powerful.
