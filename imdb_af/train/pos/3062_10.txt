I saw this movie on cable a few months ago, and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was just amazing. He cares about his character, even if he does the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is undoubtedly the best thing I saw by an actress this year. She is fantastic like a wild young woman who is wise past her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just cunning as Macy's father, and John Ritter is fine as a shrink in the middle of everything that's happening. . <br /> <br /> I wish it was in the theater because I feel it's a movie to be seen by a wider audience. It's a pity, because it's a hell better that most new movies are coming into the theater. <br /> <br />
