This is a docudrama story about the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. It especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas. <br /> <br /> One thing the story is about is the way people are expected to respond to similar situations in the same way. Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysteria after every major crisis. Just because the characters in the movies and on television behave in a certain way, there is no reason to expect real people to do it. It is especially suitable for journalists and news editors who are apparently looking for the big sob scene that will draw the ratings. This is a problem that needs to be addressed constantly. <br /> <br /> The leaders play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a large cast of all play-based individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting role players in this story are better known as comic actors. It reaffirms my idea that comic actors make the best support in drama, because with comedy they know how to make quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; by that I am actually a former Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think it's handled with great creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple are beaten by the new choppers. It captivated the themes of the story brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he had told the actors to play best for their character what they could. While especially suited to this story, I think it's also a general principle that should also apply to all players.
