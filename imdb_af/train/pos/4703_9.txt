This movie is completely hilarious. She immediately clicked frame one and took us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster movies. The conflict between brother and brother appears when Johnny's brother becomes a doctor. D.A. The best character, however, is Johnny's Crimean Word rival, the over-emphasized Moroni. As Johnny says, "The man must be arrested to kill the English language." <br /> <br /> Check it on the video. It's worth a look.
