Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine, and he is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Step by step is Gedde Watanabe. The two of them work great together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like how it shows that Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) are struggling in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. They both tried so hard to keep the peace, and then they finally got a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First, they are both on the floor. Then jumping on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunting with him on the desk. The battle then falls from the office to the factory. I love it after they are separated by the workers, you can say they both feel bad about getting things out of control. There is also a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt had on Kazihiro. He comes to his home and his boss from Japan and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow, not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is closed and we can't find a key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can't tell Michael Keaton's photo like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it's really funny, and also shows how people who are radically different are not just learning from each other, but also becoming good friends.
