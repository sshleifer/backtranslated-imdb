"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung depicts a Chinese farm boy visiting a city friend. Just like Tang Long of "Way of the Dragon." Wherever Sammo goes, the trouble starts, so he has to rely on his art skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character teaches martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even hit his nose with his thumb exactly as Bruce Lee did and also shouted his scream. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There is a big revelation near the end of the movie that is made up of foreign fighters. Sammo must meet every opponent one by one. Kind of like the game of death, where each fighter has another martial arts discipline apart. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I have seen. Excellent battle scenes and lots of laughter. A rare, classic Sammo Hung movie, I recommend to all your martial artists there. 8.5 / 10!
