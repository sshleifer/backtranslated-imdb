Harem Suare is the best movie I saw in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Shot sensually and beautifully portrayed, Harem Suare is a brave movie that takes on interracial romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors populate the film. Apart from the outside world, the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousy within their ranks.
