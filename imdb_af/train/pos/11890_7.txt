It's quite a dull movie. Well shot with realistic performances, especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and a bad boy with realistic places, moods and artistic connotations everywhere, it fails because the director has no point of view, position or critical comment on the subject he does not accept. One of France's reverent and regular work on films with Depardieu - I believe they put together 7 - Pialat fails to get involved. It seems to be a treat for why women fall for the bad boy who will be hurt if they have a comfortable boyfriend and a kind man. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the filander with an indifferent distinction, offers uprobrium answers like "I don't know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way he makes love" for her investigative man trying to kick her out of the house, but palliate and reconsider because ... I accept he loves her. So he accepts and hopes for what? That one day she woke up and came to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's derogatory doctrine of drama, with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers aren't picking up, but please take a stand. Jules and Jim are not. The final shot as cold as the movie we just watched is a sadness and headache just to the forgiveness.
