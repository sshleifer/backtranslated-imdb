While I was initially reluctant to jump on the train to watch "Lost", did I accidentally catch one episode at the start of season 1? The one with the pool beer ?? and it has had my undivided attention since then. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. Soh (heh) carries me while I throw as many stumbling, semi-coherent praises as I can apart. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of desert-crashed people, and gradually adds extraordinary depth by exploring deep and incomprehensible characters? What drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island on which they are stranded functions as a common denominator for many things in their lives, or they deviate from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But "Lost" also on the island itself and the mysterious horrors it houses ... and they all seem strangely connected. While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or brilliance of acting abilities, most of the cast of "Lost" is in fact spectacular actors for their respective parts, depicting heart and humor in their performances. There is also a multitude of eye scans, but not generally of the plastic Hollywood type like most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are very compelling to watch. Their interactions rarely fall into predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (though they are annoyingly secretive)? These people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears, being treated secondarily to action. The realism of these characters facilitates an already well-sculpted plot. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Do you imagine a tree as the template plot, then the branches are subplots (in this case one branch for each character)? Well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then small twigs to those twigs as other story lines. If you are a brother or sister of one of the main characters in the flashbacks, you will get your own storyline. If you are a DOG, you will have your own storyline. Unless the writers eventually weave them into a glorious highlight, they set themselves up. I'm more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop-out for this show because I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But if the authors accept it, pull it off, it may be the best show ever to hit television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
