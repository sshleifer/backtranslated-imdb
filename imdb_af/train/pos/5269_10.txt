I love bad movies. Not only because they are often as entertaining as' really 'good' movies (such as Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood patos), but they are often much better than those movies. And that's why I love the Italian coaching of the 1970s and 1980s movies. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has actually made very good movies, such as House on the Edge of the Park, and also his Atlantis Interceptors and lives like a cop, dies like a man's fun movies. But it's really bad. The Barbarians are such an idiotic movie. Peter and David Paul as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny because they do not have charisma and acting skills. But if they can't act, they scream and shout every time they do something important. In one scene, people are trying to follow the Barbarian Brothers, and they escape very extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, actually everything is bad in this movie. I can't describe how much I laughed when I first looked at it. The Barbarians and the Company are camp classic, everyone must see once. If you thought Plan 9 from outer space is fun camp, it would be a real killer.
