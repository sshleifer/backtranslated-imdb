This is a musical adaptation of Dicken's Oliver Twist. For the most part, the original story has been maintained, although for the film's flow certain subplots (such as the summer he spent on recycling and the half-brother) are omitted. The biggest difference in the film and the story is that Fagin is hung at the end of the book - an end that is very different from that of the music movie. <br /> <br /> It's one of a kind of musical - one whose style and scope doesn't really match or since. Not only are the songs often singable and unforgettable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. While in most musicals some people or even a small group of choreographic dances are, the numbers are often in the hundreds or perhaps more. It's really a sight to see and I was happy to see it in the theater when it made its debut and one of my earliest children's memories. If I only saw it for a few moments, I would have to say that the movie just got better. Great sets, great acting and singing - this is a special surprise that is hard to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was amazed at how high and female Mark Lester's song was for the film. Well, according to IMDb, his song was baptized by a girl and it would definitely count for his voice.
