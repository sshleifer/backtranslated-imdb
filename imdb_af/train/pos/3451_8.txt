First, this movie was not released to the theaters. They said they killed the story of curvy police, politicians and dedicated newspaper staff. Just send it DVD & cable TV> and take the money and run. <br /> <br /> It is said that I usually like this type of movie, especially with this cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard & Front, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and story were killed, BUT the above site brings life to this violent movie and it is actually viewable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a disposable newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, the other being either crooked Cops, Politicians or a little decent guys. The 2 ladies are the girl friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and do what is needed. It's very violent, many murders, etc. Not for children. This is definitely not good, <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
