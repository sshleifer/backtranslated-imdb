I enjoyed this movie, it's mainly because I like to see Sean Connery and this one has the added bonus of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in it too. The story has a grandmother looking for Connery's help because her grandson is in prison and she says he was found guilty. Initially it appears that there were racist aspects of the case, but it later emerges that the chief officer on the matter was black himself and he seems to have done some bad things to maintain a confession from the boy. Well, the boy is trying to point to another murderer who is imprisoned in the same prison, one who is about to kill. He is also a particularly nasty person because he takes a lot of joy in what he has done, writes the family of his victims and tries to get people to post them. Many twists and turns in this one, with a little unexpected. I just enjoyed Sean Connery's character and tried to make sense of the whole ordeal. The movie also made me angry in areas, especially if you find out what ultimately happened. You get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, as they are all good at this one. Eventually, this one makes for a pretty good tension / thriller.
