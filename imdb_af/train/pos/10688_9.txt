I didn't really know what to expect when I watched the movie, except for the slightly surrealistic basic plan that a lonely man ordered a Russian bride over the internet. That and Nicole Kidman had it in it. However, I absolutely loved the movie and came out and thought 'wow'. <br /> <br /> Refreshing to the earth, the movie moves together with a few surprises at every corner. The relationships in the film are credible, with Nicole and Chaplin working beautifully against each other. The humor is subtle, with some big 'office-like scenes' at the bank, and the thriller element adds tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie about real people is in an unusual situation. It's less about heroism and more about delicate relationships. Brit movie makes its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
