This film is exactly what its title describes - an effort to get you to buy in what the authors offer. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's great to see the 1996-style Toronto, I remember with all its stupid haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really didn't change; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial small urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international movies! It is also amusing to watch Kenny and Spenny to LA and find out that it is Toronto again, with a strange variety of beach bombs, musicians, fortune counters and more types of movie types. <br /> <br /> I don't see Pitch as a movie to enjoy; It's not entertaining unless the viewer enjoys someone's aspirations being trampled. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money are really kept by studio executives and production houses. Authors, musicians and actors are still mere transients, even when they reach the Great Time. <br /> <br /> So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or do it, but the message is still there.
