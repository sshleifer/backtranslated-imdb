The H.G. Wells Classic had several incarnations. The 05 'Speilburg Version and the Classic 53' Version But this one remains entirely true to the book. Nothing's changed. Nothing is removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. The director Re-Cut has the film up to 2 hours of pure excellence. She has a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels that "Wells Proud Of" would be. The story is remembered like everyone else. Martians Invade the Earth with Capsules containing an army of Tripod War Machines. The people of the 19th century are badly prepared to ward off the alien forces and fight back with cannons and guns that knife shells bound right from the Walkers and when humanity is no longer a global force, they are saved the smallest organisms on earth. . <br /> <br /> The film is a great achievement for director Timothy Hines, who has great potential, as he has created this vision with a mere 5 million budget. Today B movies have bigger budgets.
