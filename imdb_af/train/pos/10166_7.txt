I watched it on an 8-hour flight and (supposedly due to the pressure and altitude) I actually entertained it generously (emphasis on the "lights"). <br /> <br /> The real idea behind the movie was brilliant: a woman dies, her fianc√© falls in love with someone else, she decides to make sure they don't come together, but ultimately lets them do it. Unfortunately, the real movie wasn't that good. OK, there were some laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning, the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole gay-but-non-gay friend part of the story could have been much better worked. The talking parrot was a good idea, but to be honest: it wasn't really funny. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie was more interesting than staring at the chair in front of me, but it was a close bell.
