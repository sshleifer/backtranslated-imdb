Although not the best Anime I've ever seen, I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read the comic book and just saw it at the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was OK, I got the sense of the 80's anime out of it, which is what made me. Why hate everyone else who is outside of me. <br /> <br /> Character development was good. I love how they transformed the transition from Hope to Lady Death. Of course, for those of you who didn't like it, it didn't pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happened, and she used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a good mentor / soldier for her. his dark bridal style was perfect for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone here who bases it should see and reconsider it. because everything that people have founded can be said about everyone's favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
