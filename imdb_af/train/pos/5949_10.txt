Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and credible story of romance and plot. The music in wonderful and memorable. Very good colorful movie. Another movie I liked later on was High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
