One word can describe this movie and it is weird. One day I recorded this movie because it was a Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well, that is, the movie is about a young boy traveling the universe to get a metal body so he can take revenge. Along the way he meets many colorful characters and eventually he has to decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you're a fan of animation / science fiction, you might want to see it.
