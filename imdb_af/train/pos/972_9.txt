Wow! So much fun! Probably a bit much for ordinary American kids, and really it's a stretch to call it a kid's movie. This movie reminded me of some time bandits - many Terry Gilliam all the way through. While the overall narrative is quite straightforward, Miike throws a few more surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments. The very first act depends from the scene to the scene of the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the spirit world and the evil that comes from it. And while the end does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that is common to Miike's work, the low meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn damn. Like manic and imaginative fun like other great Miike movies, he just gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk tales, creative through CG and puppetry in an imaginative, advanced adventure. . F'n rad, and one of Miike's best!
