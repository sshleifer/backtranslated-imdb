I thought the kids in the show did a very good job. I especially enjoyed the performance of the Emma character. Well done! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to watch the movie and enjoy it without looking at my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the dental feast and the fire of her. The ghostly appearances of the children's souls released were also good. Another good point of the movie is that it keeps moving. There were not very slow scenes. The adult leaders were also credible and therefore helped to entertain the entertainment. All in all, a pleasant night watching the movie.
