Yes, it's wrong - especially if you're into Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a pure entertainment or fantasy story or plot, and you can't really think for yourself. <br /> <br /> The films of the smoker are For the intelligent filmmaker, and Insignificance is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> Characteristics are brilliant, the story is excellent, but like all Nic Roeg's movies, you think of every aspect of reality that would never have been before. His films always make you think, and personally I like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> So don't expect to get away from this movie and feel everyone happy, because it's likely you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's excellent.
