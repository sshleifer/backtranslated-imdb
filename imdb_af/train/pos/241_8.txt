I'm tired of people judging films about their "historical accuracy". It's a movie people !! The authors and directors should put their own turn in the story! There are a number of movies out there that aren't quite accurate with history. Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York gangs, Geronimo: An American legend, the last of the Mohicans .... all great movies that are historically inaccurate. If you want to see some good actors, do what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie and not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Enjoy the quality of the movie, the storyline and one of the best actors of our time.
