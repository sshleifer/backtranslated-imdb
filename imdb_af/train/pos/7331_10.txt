In a time of magic, barbarians and demons dominate a deadly tyrant called Nekhron and his mother Queen Julian who lives in the icicle and conquer the region of fire ruled by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra kidnapped is. by Nekhron's goons, a warrior named Larn must protect her and defeat Nekhron to take over the world and the kingdom with the help of a prisoner named Dark Wolf. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic combines lively actors with animation about them (rotoscope), this is Ralph Bakshi's second best film, just with 'American Pop' number one and 'Heavy Traffic 'Third and' Wizards' fourth. It's definitely better than its "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings". The artwork is designed by renowned artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has good color and there is also a hottie for the guys. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere, especially the new 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD from Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> Also recommend: "The Black Cauldron", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian", "The Wizard of Oz", "Rock & Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal" , "Starchaser: Legend of Orin", "Fantastic Planet", "Princess Mononoke", "Nausicca: Valley of the Wind", "The Sword in The Stone", "Excalibur", "Army of Darkness", "Krull", "The Sword in the Stone", "The Queen of Destroyer", "Willow", "The Princess Bride" Dragonheart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," Return of the King (1980) "," Conquest " , American Pop, Jason and The Argonauts, Clash of the Titans, The Last Unicorn, The Secret of NIMH, The Flight of Dragons, Hercules (Disney), Legend, The Chronicles of Narnia , "Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire".
