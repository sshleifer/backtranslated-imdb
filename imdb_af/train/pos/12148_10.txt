This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one. He showed his comic side and it was very strange to see him to save. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought the knot could be deadly? Very good stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you have a wonderful final revelation! Don't mess with Manchu thugs; they are relentless!
