OK, this movie is stupid. I mean this in a good way though. It was deliberate and was one of the better "stupid" movies I saw. The jokes and gags are deliberately bad, but rendered in a way that has struck all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were fairly level and mediocre. There is a pretty bad plot, but it works just fine. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is the focus here. She is sweet and loving. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that only glows in this movie. In addition, it was physical and honest. Few men couldn't agree. The parts that show her figure were also of the cleaner scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a smile from ear to ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. I wish they made a dozen more Elvia movies.
