I saw it on the plane last week to NZ, wondering how it would measure the British film and the book. I must say I was pleasantly impressed. Anything that works the fanatic attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years is even better than the original commitment to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a Briton, I was also interested to see that you don't need baseball to get what is going on. One question arises: Was the script written with the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the Bambino? Or was there another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan of myself (strangely I know, a Brit who understands baseball), I have to say it added to the pleasure.
