I have to admit that I'm a big fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that's why I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this movie, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about one page of a group's history (like "I'm trying to break your heart", about Wilco) , but rather covers a long period of group history. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner followed friends and opponents for over 8 years (1995 - 2003), Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW), and shoots 1500 hours of raw video. 1:45 hours (the future DVD edition will contain much more material than the original movie). The result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and true archival material that feels like movie progress you've been living with throughout the years. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of their careers, both bands promised to revolutionize music making and not to sell their souls to the "record industry" devil. However, the Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular after only one album (especially in Europe). The Brian Jonestown Massacre (with his self-destructive leader Anton Newcombe) forgot about it (at least how it is portrayed in the film). And the movie follows the origins of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, faced with the rise of The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First, I was delighted with the film and its approach to tell the story of Anton Newcombe (for example, tell Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols), but after a few thoughts I have realize that something is wrong with this movie. First, he treated Anton Newcombe as a disappeared person. The project started in 1995 as a documentary on several promising emerging groups, in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (this was why Ondi Timoner had had unauthorized access to the two bands these years). It was Anton Newcombe who brought The Dandy Warhols into the project. In the end, he was completely ignored, as if he had been kicked out of the project. Everyone talks about BJM, but he doesn't take part in the discussion. I think he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process. There are always both sides of the story, and here we have one ... Of course, as one would expect, Anton does not accept the final result and sees this role as a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> Secondly, the movie is a lot of Dandy Warhols biased. Certainly, the winner takes everything, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (leader of DW) tells (although it seems a good choice - it gives a sense of closer involvement) and that the late history of ties is disproportionately represented (BJM is until 1997, and DW to 2003), does not add objectivity to the movie. <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is (somewhat) level. What do we want to teach us? As one critic said: "... film examines old questions: where does genius fit in a commodified world? Can it flourish and become indebted, or must it be self-destructed to maintain its integrity?" No, it doesn't investigate these questions! It just shows a story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician, told by a less brilliant but successful one who enjoys greater self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's ... just god damn interesting, at least for the DW or BJM fans. I don't know for the rest of the crowd ...
