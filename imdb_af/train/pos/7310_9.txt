There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films, not only in its genre, but also outside. I love the movies, creepy atmosphere like the whole thing it can happen, kind of situation makes it scary to think. If you were ever in this situation, what would you do. It's a movie I enjoy watching, especially around Halloween time. John Carpenter is a very professional director, I love many of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best-known movie is the movie Halloween. And if you think of watching the Rob Zombie remake, don't do it. It's pure crap and a real Halloween fan wants the 1978 John Carpenter version better. Michael Myers is one of the coolest shooters. in any movie, and is a very famous one. So then you see this masterpiece, you will really enjoy it.
