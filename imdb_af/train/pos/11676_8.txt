If you loved Long Way Round, you'll enjoy it almost as much. It is educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan made a few appearances, but Charley pulled it straight. He is funny, engaging and still a burden of stress and doubt. Great things! <br /> <br /> The series falls into 7 episodes. Like the LWR, the preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover the race well, there may be a little more explanation of the trucks and cars, which are just mentioned and rarely even seen. However, it is a motorcycle movie and anyone on two wheels will like it. <br /> <br /> The series features beautiful photography as well as some interviews of people's mouths. Yikes. There's another extremely catchy theme song like LWR, but this one isn't nearly as good as the Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US, God knows when it's released, then buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh, and be prepared to buy another motorcycle.
