Since their nasty divorce from the Disney company (with Disney holding the Miramax brand), the Weinstein company seems to specialize in top-average films that are then promoted and seen by little. THE FLOCK is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping up with registered sex offenders will tell you more about sex criminals than a whole season of Law and Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives his best performance as the soft-spoken agent exhausted by the task. For once, Claire Danes has the opportunity to get a solid role (instead of the mess she usually sticks) and she makes the most of the beginner. The cinematography, pacing, editing, everything is first class --- and I have seen no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump or excess camera cuts others have complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it is still a difficult topic and makes you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there was almost no problem with the types of sex crimes that abound, even bored. Then the Supreme Court took decisions that tied police hands simultaneously, as the "rights" of sex workers were opened and America changed into a shopping paradise for sexual perversion, both willing and unwilling. Each of these steps was dedicated by the Liberals, who celebrated Warren's bad deeds with lashes on Time and Newsweek. Daily liberals also praised the court's actions and mocked those who disagree. In 2007, many Americans know that the kind of porn depicting cruel violence and torture of young women can be attributed, and its delivery is subsidized by the US newspaper rate. Just one part of the problem - a problem that anyone's family can tear. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal, but he does his best in his performances here. Perhaps he had some wisdom in his adult age.
