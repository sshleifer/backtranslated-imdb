I didn't read the other comments on the movie, but on the basis of the average rating, I can see that it is unlikely to be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I watched it for the second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. It probably didn't have the adults around the floor, but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it look so. <br /> <br /> It's a real Mel Brooks-farce, with lots of moral content - how sad it is to love our money, not who we are and how fickle our friends and associates are. There are many other films on a similar subject, no doubt, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. However, it is difficult for me to make such an impact on the junior family members. <br /> <br /> So, for the kids, a 9/10 of mine.
