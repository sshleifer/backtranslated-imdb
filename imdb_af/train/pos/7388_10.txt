The 74th Oscar was a very good one. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very funny and light. I personally loved her last look, which generated a few zealous reviews due to coarse language and mocking jokes, but that's good. The audience looked right. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier made it an Oscar show to remember. <br /> <br />
