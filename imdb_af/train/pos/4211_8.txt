I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other UN era films. I loved the way Chip would have been calm for a moment and then the next time. It was classic. Ahh yeah. The ladies, the villians, the cigars and the dull policemen! It has everything. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common to this era of movie. Very risky because blacklists were popular in those days. I rate this movie one of the best I've seen in the FN genre!
