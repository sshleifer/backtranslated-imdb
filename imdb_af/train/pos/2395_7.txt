Although it was unfortunate to hit the party ring here in Austin (SXSW Film), just as we got tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. A look at the play "The Scottish Play" as actors called "Macbeth" when it is made to avoid the curse. It is a sharp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery that the troops take. With a stunningly attractive score and look and sound much better than its small budget, it is a quiet jewel, not world-class, but totally satisfying.
