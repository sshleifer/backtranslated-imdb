If this movie was made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. For 1909, however, it was a dandy little movie and today is pretty good. Just don't try to compare this silent movie with later silence - the industry has changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century are not seen like movies in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> <br /> This movie is 11 minutes long (average for most movies afterwards) and is a variation of the Edgar Allen Poe story, THE CONTACT OF AMONTILLADO. While very familiar with the story, I won't expand any more because I don't want to ruin the movie. Just enough to say it's very creepy !!
