SPOILERS Sex huh? It is one of the most basic parts of human life. Still, do we ever take it too seriously? People always want more, even those who get it daily, and if you are unhappy, there are potential life-changing (creating) consequences. Ironically, people say that we all start having sex at a younger and younger age (despite Victorian marriage and children in their early teens). It must be increasingly difficult for those who come to a point as virgins. In Steve Carell's first big screen, he leads a man who has climbed to 40 without driving it. We treat countless loud and extreme sex-related incidents, not to mention curse as an episode of "Eurotrash", the general plot of the movie and its principle doesn't sound funny. So it's a pleasant surprise, so for all the inappropriate, jokes, an incredibly large number of people are hitting and leaving the audience in hysteria. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a good guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament. At the same time, he takes blatant life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as an essential fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for several reasons, but mostly unfortunate, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) all offer Andy advice with one goal in mind. To put him out of his misery and leave him lying. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about "Anchorman", it was just a matter of time before Steve Carell gave himself a lead of his own. Impressively, in The 40 Year Old Virgin, he does not disappoint. Carell is a revelation that is the hopeless, shy virgin to the perfection, and he is gradually becoming more confident. The advice begins to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as the love interest are all wonderful. Rudd is a personal favorite as the loving sick David, who falls apart at various times and shares the best scene with Rogen as the two argue about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise about this movie is not the way it is. many of the jokes have hit the point, but actually the clever way it flips the message on its head. Obviously designed for Conservative America, the film's entire toes evolve from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence. The virgin needs no sex to complete his life, he just needs trust and true love. A valuable message to preach and a significant improvement on the one you expect at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is weird to see a rough comedy that is consistently funny and good, but low and behold, "40-year-old Virgin" is just that. Also add a good meaning message and you're well on your way to a top-class comedy. A surprising joy.
