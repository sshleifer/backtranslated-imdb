It must be one of the most beautiful, moving, thought-provoking films. This is good family entertainment and at the same time makes you very difficult about the problems involved. Every time I see the "ghost of Zac on the bike through the pool, I can't help but scream my eyes. John Thaw's performance is so touching and it is a pity he is no longer with us. Outstanding movie Full points.
