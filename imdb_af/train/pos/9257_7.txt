Are they your typical women in naval fleet love story? Perhaps, hell, you know how the formula works from now on, beautiful woman is introduced to a photo, someone must fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows some typical story lines, but it doesn't say anything about the content. There are huge scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, though short. Some things didn't make sense, like the need to introduce random battles, but it's fun to watch, the battles were actually well done. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a comedy top, but it has a very good feel to it. The humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach, but you will keep a smile. <br /> <br /> There is some steaming action, not one for the kids.
