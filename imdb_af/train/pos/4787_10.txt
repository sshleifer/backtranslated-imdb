David Lynch usually makes movies that look like puzzles that have the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and reflect on, but they do not really believe in your mind. Maybe art will always mean the most to his creator. <br /> <br /> The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. Not that there is anything typical about them anyway. It is an odyssey by rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight adopted a lawnmower to come to his brother's house. He has 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Sion, Wisconsin, to adjust his sick brother for proceedings. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this movie, Richard Farnsworth is so nice. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film fits slowly, fits Alvin's long way to realization. <br /> <br /> Alvin encounters a confused and scared young girl along the way. She is pregnant and has decided to walk away from her situation. After listening to Alvin, she spoke about family. She reconsidered later. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin, witnessing a depraved woman killing a deer with her car. She complained that she had killed and left a few. Alvin feels bad, but is smart enough to cook good meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's mower breaks his brakes and almost kills him. A nice man and his wife left him in their garden while he was fixing it. They even let him call his lovely but slow daughter, played nicely by Sissy Spacek, who was played in a terrible tragedy in her past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin thanks. <br /> <br /> As Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a friendly old man as they discuss the crisis of war and the price they have on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper who haunts him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two brothers who have repaired his lawnmower. He talks to them prudently and calls them on their high labor costs and repair costs. He even helps them to teach one another to learn from his own mistakes with his brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin left the man's yard, he took off his hat. The man told him it was an honor to leave him and asked Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in simplicity. It's warm because it's so straightforward, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can't help getting more and more involved. We want Alvin to come to his brothers. We want him to be compensated. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth at its best. It was his last movie and his performance was wonderful. You can't help but understand his pride, listen to his wisdom, and finally feel his pain. One moves in with him as the man who offers him the backyard. <br /> <br /> In the afterlife, Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth are at a bar. I can present their photos of their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the movie, "My brother and I first looked at the stars." Well, I know they're all with the best views in the house.
