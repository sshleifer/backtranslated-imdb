The Road Rovers were a good show on dog heroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world. The show was hilarious to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that can appeal to all ages. Run jokes throughout the range that can spray a drinking game. The action was fascinating and clever. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional problems that are never expressed, but this implies in subtext. Hopefully one day, somehow, the Rovers will be back in action.
