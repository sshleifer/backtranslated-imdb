Any way the wind blows is Tom Barmans (also known as the foreman of the debut film of the rock formation 'dEUS'). The film is completely shot in Antwerp (Belgium). The film starts on a sunny Friday morning and jumps slightly superficially between events that fill the day of a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have many things to think about, because most of the different story lines are wide open. <br /> <br /> The movie has a (purely instrumental) soundtrack that will rock off your socks. In most scenes, the music really enhances the general atmosphere and feel, and makes the movie hallucinating to watch at certain times. The main game in the film, the party, was shot very well. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, as his main characters on one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard have been heard. <br /> <br /> The script is good stuff. Camera angles and colors were chosen very well. The costumes are very warm and seventy. And I loved most of the acting. <br /> <br /> The thing I like most about the movie is the subtle attacks of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that interferes. <br /> <br /> Without being a comedy (this movie is definitely not a comedy, but rather an alternative art), it still drives its audience giggling and even laughing. <br /> <br /> This is yet another director's debut that shouldn't end. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future, because I had a good time. Cheers.
