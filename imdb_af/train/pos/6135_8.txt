Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It is filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared in the pavement.) I see this film mainly through the child's eyes because I have not seen it in years. Then it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that started with the ghostly armor that was in battle) were my favorites. There was also a lot of stop animation used with the game (ie people changing into rabbits), which might be a bit dated and stupid. (I also believe the movie is slow.) Through the eyes of a child it is a fun movie and it is easy for children to place themselves in the children's places in the movie. It is an imaginative film that, unfortunately, was largely forgotten today.
