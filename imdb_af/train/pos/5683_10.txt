Just to say you have a movie about John Holmes, is a guarantee to get a few people in front of the screen, but writer / director James Cox delivers so much more. A "rashamon" of the crazy Hollywood series, the movie divides the Wonderland murders of July 1981 through a variety of angles (and movie supplies), but mostly through the filter of John Holmes's tissue brain. In a movie full of bad guys, Holmes is either the most boring, the most pathetic or both. Several versions of the story come to the fore and add as Cox flicker jumping cues and turn title cards amid effects and emotions. The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never fails. While filming for two years after Holmes fought pornography and in really bad drugs, he expressed a sexuality that can be measured in inches. This sexuality on its sides creates a sense of prejudice hanging over the whole movie, almost as heavy as the violence in its center. These murders are plastered throughout the film, but it has never been clearly shown, even at the peak, although the violence of them blends the whole picture relentlessly and a lot of blood is splashed on walls and crime scenes. Again Val Kilmer as Holmes shows he can perform better than anyone else works. Tighter, cringing, bragging or begging, Kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating carwreck. Standing on performances alongside Kilmer definitely joins Ted Levine as the lead educator in the investigation and Lisa Kudrow as Holmes's estranged wife. The trio of criminals entering Holmes include the frighteningly high energy Josh Lucas, the ever-interesting Timothy Blake Nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable Dylan McDermott in a key role as the counter is another version of the murders. Cox suggests that, regardless of how much we learn about Wonderland, there is always a worse version possible, but by looking at it, it is very fascinating to understand the truth.
