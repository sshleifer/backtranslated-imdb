Go to something far away from the deliberately rough stuff he usually makes, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this parody of the well-known / art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, she offers him his big break, which he accepts. But as soon as he gets it big, he has to reconsider everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, Pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life as soon as he becomes a celebrity. The kind of thing we can expect, sure, but with Waters directing, there are always a few things to shock us (you will know them when you see them). I definitely recommend it. Also with Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
