I watched this movie on television last night. Back then, it has the title "Trap to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply touched by the story and amazed by the visual effects of the court case (those who saw it know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is right there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated highly by IMDB voters and rightly - more than 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10. more than 84% classified it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it wasn't listed in the top 250 movies until I realized so little had seen / rated this movie compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America) so 1) I can buy it and 2) others discover this hidden treasure.
