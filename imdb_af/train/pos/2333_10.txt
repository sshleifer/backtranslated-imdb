I recently started watching this show, and I have to say it really made me laugh. You must appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some others said this show should include more realistic reactions from the dead. If you assume that Ned can make the dead alive again, you must accept the other completely crazy pieces of the show. I couldn't help smiling at every episode I watched. I really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it look good. I absolutely love the narrative, I think it adds the extra bit to the whole show. You can't always compare old performances by a writer with his new ones, you have to take everything as his own entity. Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
