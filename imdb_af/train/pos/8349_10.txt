Depardieu's most notorious film is this (1974) pioneer of Bertrand Blier. It features a lot of highly-rated X-rated scenes, including one by Jeanne Moreau who has a warm 1970s of Jules and Jim with a two-hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no such thing as a holy area in this movie; everything is fair. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that Americans do not like much of this movie, while many French people I met consider it a classic. There is something about what is programmed against Americans to "like". <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two bitch-slapping, hippy drifters with many sexual uncertainties, going around to molest women and commit crime. . They are out for kicks and anti-capitalist, Euro commie, slacker 'freedom.' Bladder satirizes hell out of these two guys while at the same time civil society itself looks much more ridiculous. Best of all, however, is the way the wonderful Stephane Grappelli score carries the restless soul of the drifters, the deeper subconscious awareness or 'higher ideal', motivating all the folly with which they are involved.
