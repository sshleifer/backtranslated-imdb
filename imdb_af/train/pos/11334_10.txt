I would say that this film gives an insight into the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is divorced by divorce or other disasters. I would highly recommend this movie, especially for parents or individuals planning to have a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters to be attractive and highly sympathetic to many dimensions. <br /> <br /> The scary monster, but probably not scary for most adults, has a very good hint of creating the overactive imagination of a child experiencing unfamiliar terrors. <br /> <br /> I found the movie great!
