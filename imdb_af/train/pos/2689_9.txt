It's a hot, funny movie, to the same extent as Almodovar's works. Certainly, it has a ten-year-old boy who sucks milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that I can't understand the readers who have found it sick or perverse (but would I be willing to give my 10-year-old son to let the part play?

As his lover tells him, "Most people are ashamed of the sailing. You change it into an art form. '
