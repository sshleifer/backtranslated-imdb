It's a wonderful movie with a fun, clever story and the dynamics of cultural differences and the leading theme of what's important in life make it a very underestimated movie. Don't let the cynics of the world keep you from seeing it. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder about the fact that comedy is never appreciated, as actors such as Keaton make humor to serious pieces look very easy. Great movie all around!
