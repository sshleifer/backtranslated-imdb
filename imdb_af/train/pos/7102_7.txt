Other reviewers here seem to think it's a horrible movie. It's simply not true and a little unfair. <br /> <br /> The acting is of good quality and the direction is moving with decent fluidity. I don't think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of concluding stories. Maybe it's just a new tool for directors to try. I thought it made the movie much more interesting. Maybe some elements of the script should be tightened, but it's about the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a good performance as Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is beautiful and the price of recording is just worth it.
