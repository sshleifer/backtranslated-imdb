It was without a doubt the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. Of the opening credits, you are auctioned off in a vengeance that is hard-hitting and deeply complicated. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman from revenge. Eastwood has many "one-sided" series that have nothing to do with the plot, but shows Harry his bad ones. Posted with memorable characters in small roles, rolling this movie and serving as the standard for detectives / action flashes. It is the one Dirty Harry movie that is raw and without any "fluff". I can see it again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it is a pleasant "revenge money". The pass is fast and several of the screens are memorable. "Go ahead - Make my day ... You feel happy, Punk? ...." Classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with its depraved, rubbery expressions and whispering, threatening voice, can do it.
