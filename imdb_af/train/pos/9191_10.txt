Well, I didn't get the fleece fire case, the first time I watched this episode. There seemed to be something significant that I couldn't finger. This time the Costa Mesa fires on TV caught my attention - and it helped me write an Inferno essay! But let me see what hasn't been discussed yet. <br /> <br /> A TWOP review mentioned that Tony has 7 stairs to go down due to the broken elevator. Yes, 7 is an important number for many reasons, especially religious, but here is another one for you. On a hunch I consulted wikipedia, and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels? Purgatorio. Exclusive fire and paradise. (The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and ... that Tony can't get.) <br /> <br /> To the alleged "random" monk slap scene. Once the monks have appeared, it fits in perfectly with Tony trying to get out of the purgatory. You can say he was worried when that Christian commercial (death, illness and sin) came out, and he is becoming increasingly desperate because the Christian sky looks a little cowardly to him. By the time he meets the monks, he thinks, "Hey, maybe these guys can help me?" Other religions seem to be considered (eg Buddhism) and wondering if another path can take him to "salvation". Not that Tony necessarily literally thinks he's a Buddhist, but Finnerty seems to have tried (and destroyed) it. That slap in the face basically tells Tony there isn't a quick fix. No, you can't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get away. <br /> <br /> Initially, Tony was not too concerned about how to go to heaven. But at the "conference entrance" he realizes that it won't be that easy for him. Initially, I saw the name versus driver's license problem, as Tony had a double life, which, with the killing of people and sleeping, kept secret from most people. He feels free to have a relationship with Quasi-Melfi because "he's Kevin Finnerty". He states that he can deceive some people with KF's cards, such as hotel receptionists, but it won't get him out of purgatory. The helicopters - the helicopters of Heaven - keep up with him and everything he does. <br /> <br /> After reading all the theories about "inFinnerty", it seems as if KF's identity is a reminder of the infinite variety of paths Tony could take in his life. Possibly with the car joke in Infiniti's, which made me nothing else. Aaaand, at that point, broke my brain.
