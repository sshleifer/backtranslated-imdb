The magnetism from Elvira, which attracts her legions of devoted admirers, has a jungle quality. With her long, well-toned figure, big-chest, innocent malicious attitude and lexicon of my generation valley, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual very interested in the narrative of the storytelling, it is clear that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help the character more than the sum of her curly one-linen and one big chest. As inspired by the way the children of the village respond to her, she represents the deeply adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect with them from their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic longing, boyish sexual urge and desire for non-threatening light hearts. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of femininity that is perfect for the boys and a source of power for the girls of the village. The other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her movie can no longer move. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her movie is limited by how poor a showcase is for her talents. Almost everything is adapted to an adolescent mindset and although it is a simple comedy, only those who are still processing information with a young person's mind can enjoy nonsense. Luckily I have such an ability and find the movie a beautiful charmer. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: Bob Rescue: How's your head? Elvira: I had no complaints.
