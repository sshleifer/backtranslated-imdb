This film was quite a surprise. I didn't expect much to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? Approximately? Probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm-swung and facial twists that show low-grade silent movies as often. <br /> <br /> Well, I went wrong. Greta Garbo just had to shock the studio people, as much as she did to me, because this movie made her star and deserve it. She instinctively understood the power to just stand still, or simply hold a sensible expression for a long, winding moment so that its effect can be felt and not only seen. I thought to myself how did this modern actress get into a creaking silent movie? She was just years and years before her time. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that interesting, it's the ordinary story of love that has been found and lost. It's just the show of Garbo as Leonora, the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who's gone, giving it life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is useful, but his character is never really developed and he is used by writing. At one stage he is made to wear Garbo's clothes, go in a shirt, then return and return. And let's not even talk about his terrible final scenes with Garbo and then his wife. Too ordinary, he didn't have much of a career after this and I can understand why. But he suffices as the somewhat mystical object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There is one absolutely fantastic line in this movie that just says it all. "Leonora, you get conspicuous." Yes, striking. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's all about, without seeing the whole movie, just watch the last 30 seconds or so - look at Garbo's look while sitting alone in her luxury car. "She must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I must see this one again, Garbo is just amazing.
