Most Stoke Files consider it the best Stooges shortcut, and that's right. Curly is a scream attracted to 'Senorita Cucaracha', and Moe and Larry are in the best shape as 'Senor Mucho' and 'Senor Gusto' respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful operative voice is maintained - she was actually a trained opera singer - and it is wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pumping Italian singer who is fought by the Stooges at a social party. Some really funny gags, good direction and very careful editing make this rise the very best of Stooges' productive output. What is even more surprising is that at that stage Curly had serious health problems and in several of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is, of course, sick. his timing is far away, he speaks slowly and quietly and has trouble getting around. Luckily, his health was up and running when he made this film. Classic Stooge comedy, and even enjoy non-Stooge fans (I had a girl who couldn't stand the Stooges, but even she laughed at this one). A must-see.
