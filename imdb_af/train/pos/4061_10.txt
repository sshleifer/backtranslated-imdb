It's the best thing I've ever heard at Disney, as well as the best adaptation ever since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation of the general heroine. This one has both hero and heroine (although I do not fully endorse the use of hero and heroine here, as Miyazaki comes from the stereotype and general theme). As usual, after being taken away by Spirited, astonished by Mononoke, upset by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this begins with a little doubt in my mind. Wonder if it will be the first Ghibi dud. Well, in the end just like yesterday and whispering of the heart, I finally got ten scores. I want to give 9.8 degrees, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Somehow I see it as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the deserted place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if man cannot really live with too much power. The collapsing scene ended my patches of Metropolis. It's just sad in some way. The plot is clear in most reviews and the soundtrack also arranges (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People who can bring a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a quiet moment by astonishing composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling movie that was previously part of the American cinema (it's a wonderful life, etc.). Well, things change ....
