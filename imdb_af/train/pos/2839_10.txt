I saw this movie on a preview screen and found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a true twist on a romance that explores clever, funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human race's most powerful emotion. <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, a real Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all perform in some way. <br /> <br /> It is not to mention that one whose director is clever and interesting. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WEG! This movie is not a straightforward romance or romantic comedy, though romantic and funny. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's good in my opinion. Go see it for yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
