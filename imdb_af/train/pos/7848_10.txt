This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. It's not just a fun movie or a well-made movie. It's a landmark in the art of animation and even if it wasn't, just the technical skill that goes with it will make a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz has a stop-motion film about the secret life of beetles. He introduced a coherent world of insects, with work, homes, nightclubs, movie houses, even small props such as posters and bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this movie he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has a relationship with a dance dragonfly, much to a locust's jaw; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot the flake. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle has her own relationship. Mr. Beetle chases away the lover, but forgives his wife. The two make up and go out to the movies. And the movie they see is Mr. Beetle and the Dragonfly. So describe, it sounds trite, but once seen it is a gripping work of the theater. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz found out what future animators would use in their work. Therefore, he should not be forgotten.
