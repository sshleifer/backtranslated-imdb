When we talk about Hollywood Hotel, we can talk about one of three things, the real hotel, the radio program and this movie, which was partly inspired by the first two. Dick Powell hosted the Hollywood Hotel program on the CBS radio network in which Louella Parsons worked out the weekly kick on the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons debuted the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934 so that by 1937 it heard its fair share of the radio. Powell hosts, sings and kibitzed with Louella and her film star guests. With the power she had with her column, she was able to get the different stars to continue and to link their latest movies to nothing. <br /> <br /> Then the American Federation of Radio Artists entered and asked for his wages to be paid. accordingly and they won the case. It ended the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Louella went to other radio stations. The whole story is covered in the Tony Thomas book, The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the plug came, this movie from Powell's home studio from Warner Brothers inspired the radio show. Powell is playing a singer / saxophonist with the Benny Goodman band signed to a Hollywood contract. But when he comes out of Hollywood, he gets a selfish movie star Lola Lane, her brilliant double-act sister Rosemary Lane, and a ham actor in Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in a Civil War epic he makes with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. Then Mowbray develops a Lina Lamont problem when asked to go on the Hollywood Hotel radio program broadcast from the Hollywood hotel. It has the studio in a tizzy. Let's say the problem isn't solved as it's singing in the rain, but Powell's manager Ted Healy seems to be resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer have a very good score for the movie. The big hit song comes right in the beginning as the Benny Goodman band with the song song Johnnie Davis sings Hollywood's anthem, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite, however, is Powell and Rosemary Lane is singing, I'm like a fish out of water. Just listen to Johnny Mercer's lyrics about Ginger Rogers who run the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without her fan. It is a compendium of American popular culture in the Thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley does the choreography here and while the film does not have the spectacular imaginary things his previous work with Warner Brothers has, the numbers are well performed. Berkeley's big moment is in a drive where Powell and Healy were forced to work. The number begins with the release of Bennie Goodman from the Hollywood hotel. Let it be your lesson and then at the Powell, Lane entry, and start the whole place with song to the excitement of owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's excitement. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman finds out why he is called the King of Swing as the band with trumpeter Gene Krupa and xylophoneist Lionel Hampton as part of his ensemble. It also sings with Frances Langford. And possibly the last surviving member of the group was a fellow who had a little bit as a radio presenter. He died in 2004, but not before becoming the 40th president of the United States. Ronald Reagan has always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two guys at Warner Brothers who were best for an eager young player who wanted to make his point. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is a nice and entertaining movie, dated but charming.
