When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before I saw the movie. I'm sure the movie would have been very different if I didn't read the book. The writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main chart of the book, with minor differences, of course. I think the thing that disappointed me most about the movie was Boyle who played Col's role. I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it doesn't seem to matter what the mood of the movie is, she always tries to use her - colored lips, and dark eyes to make her look super sexy. In fact, I think the movie was true to the true creepiness of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so strange that the boy was killed in Iraq and in the current case Casey Sheehan whose mother has a great tirade in Iraq). In the book, of course, the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house switched on the boy's video in the helicopter, I was really crawling out. Overall, I was impressed with the movie because it followed the book very well.
