This is a very long film, which means you get very bored before it gets interesting, but the length offers the opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathy. <br /> <br /> If you move through the guilty of the cruel, you will find it very heartbreaking, because it is a story that finds its heroes under evil and weak. If you can love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - a man who has been manipulated and formed since childhood. <br /> <br /> There isn't one really similar character in the whole story, not one loyal, "moral" personality to sympathize with. But looking at the whole thing without the help of a tissue will be remarkable. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. It's worthwhile for people who love exciting movies about bases human character.
