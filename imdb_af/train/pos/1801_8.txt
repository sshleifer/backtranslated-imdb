I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it and I still do it. But what I realize now is that it is an "adult" for a G-rated movie, especially the idea of ​​dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work great together, and Reynolds voice is suitable for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from upbeat ("Let's Make Music Together") to straight emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot well, though it goes once or twice on a tangent. The last scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I have ever seen in animation. A movie worth experiencing.
