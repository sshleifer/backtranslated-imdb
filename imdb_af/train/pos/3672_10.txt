A spectacular documentary document on some Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), is trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic strip of their struggle to pull everything together, despite a number of conflicting threads. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works like a movie in a way that is very similar to why This is Spinal Tap (1984) works so well. Namely, although it is exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth, and the truth is "behind the scenes" facts that are very different from the public face of the industry. It's not easy to make a movie, and it must have been very difficult especially in Canada in the late 1970s. Films include dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. Of particular importance are the financiers and the screen talent, as if falling at any time or becoming unbearable while the film is in production, it could endanger the whole affair, whether it is necessary to completely reject the film. <Br /> <br /> It is therefore not surprising that Hollywood North is focusing on such relationships. The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The writing is flawless and the performances are on top of that. It's a must-see for a budding movie maker and anyone with a serious interest in the movie-making vessel. It should also be more than fun for any viewer with some intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 of me.
