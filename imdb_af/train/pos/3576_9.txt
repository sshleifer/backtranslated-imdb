Honestly, I find this movie almost too depressed for my own good. It is very depressed to almost the whole end. I can't justify any character who did things I didn't like (except the disgusting character that Fredrick Forrest played). But it's still so frustrating to see people acting like that, to put walls around themselves when just a word or so can break the ice and promote healing. <br /> <br /> A nice tragedy hits a Montana family. They believe they have lost one boy, but it seems they have lost 2. The key is that they will only lose their second son permanently. <br /> But they just can't. Something blocks this family from sharing their grief. Some family retreat in silence and resentment while other finger tips point (and then continue to cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the deceased girlfriend's friend ... that Andy character is really a snake!) The only one member of the family who does not threaten Arnold in a way is his grandfather (Wilford Brimley). Grandpa apparently could talk to the boy without judgments or even gloves. He seems to know what the child thinks about, although Arnold doesn't say much today. It's really a blessing for the poor child to have that one he can turn around. No one else sees the fact that Arnold may be in shock, in denial, or that his raw way may not be the same style or speed as they would expect. It's so easy to judge and be angry and to feel that someone is "out of stone" just because they don't grieve in a way we believe they belong. <br /> <br /> The story is very quiet and naturalistic. You're not going to tell a spoon fed or get some Hollywood good resolution. I was very worried about the fact that this child was found to be so guilty that he needed to drive a few hundred miles to apologize to his wife, Andy's wife, for something he should not blame him for. Arnold may have murdered his brother by accident, but no one is responsible for the end of that marriage, which is apparently a cowardly one anyway, except for the two people in marriage. It's just dumb luck. Arnold did not get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are frustratingly effective as parents who cannot find it on their own to communicate with their son. , to find out what Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, who I didn't see elsewhere, except for a childhood favorite called EXPLORERS and a horrible ghost story called THE LADY IN WHITE, did an amazing job as Arnold, a good performance of a children's actor. <br /> <br /> Besides being slightly slow, STONE BOY is an excellent and very depressing movie.
