It's a fantastic series first and foremost. It is very well done and very interesting. As a great WWII buff, I learned a lot before I saw this series. One of the best things about this is all the interviews with previous individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, relatively speaking, that is. It is nothing against the men you see questioning in today's programs, but it is just that most of these men were not really involved in the top echelons of what happened. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but really just think the deaths (like myself) will want to buy it or watch it more than once. My only true complaint about this whole series is that some of the facts are not as accurate as we know now. Especially with the information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in places. The information is now different from what we now know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall a fascinating look at World War II and a must for any serious WWII historian, professional or personal.
