Poor Ivy: Although she was born that way, she had the misfortune to marry a beautiful drink (Richard Ney). As the film was set in the 20's or 30's, when the rigid Victorian ideas of the class started eating, the unclear status made her unnecessary. The Gretorexes (named for them) don't know where their next shillings come from, but there are hunting parties and fancy dress spots in vague pleasaunces to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) made the acquaintances of a rich older gentleman (Herbert Marshall, who had to be born middle-aged), she proposed one of her extra-large chapeaux. Fortunately, one of the beaux she still cuts (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose consulting rooms offer a poison paint, with which she offers her farewell farewell. The fact that it implies Knowles does not prevent her a little, even if the hours drop until he is hung through the neck to death. The turn of the plot depends on the police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowles' loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to these well above average melodramas; Fontaine's light face provides the rest.
