I just watched 2 movies of Pang brothers, The Eye and One just take. When I looked at The Eye, I was so disappointed with these two guys that I had heard good words about them before. That movie (The Eye) has a very bad writing, especially the end (childish, clich√© and concise in my opinion), but it is still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to just take one and I wasn't disappointed again. Still fantastic photography, beautiful image, MTV style editing, cool music and this time, the story has a lot of spirit, logical and beautiful, you will see a few small plot holes, but it does not cause problems with the storyline. The only problem with this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
