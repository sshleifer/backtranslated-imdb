The stars Melvyn Douglas, "Amazing Mr. Williams", made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also did those movies for five years, THREE of which they made together! Douglas is Lt. Williams, and he and his cohorts are presented with a dead body, and they have to find out what really happened. Viewers will recognize his co-workers - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played positions of authority ... senators, bank presidents, policemen. This one that has a flair of comedy about it - the policemen always throw jabs on each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend struggle orally. Some fun days - Williams even takes the man who arrested them with his girlfriend on a date. There are many fun things here, so get past the slow start and wait for the funnier things later. Don't give away a treat, so catch it on Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall mostly made comedies and was engaged to Lucy at one stage.
