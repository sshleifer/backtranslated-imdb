Historical drama and the forthcoming life story in which free people of color were involved in pre-civil war New Orleans. Start slowly but start steaming as soon as you learn about the main characters and start the right action. It's not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because it was free people. They may not have all the rights of whites, but they certainly had more control over their fate than their slave ancestors. The young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives, whether they live in the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
