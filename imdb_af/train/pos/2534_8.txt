Scientist working in isolation finds a way to detect the impact crater of a meteorite containing a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are there, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any disease if properly applied. When he sues his opponents - who threw himself out of the scientific community and mocked him - to prove his discovery, they presented a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course, they ended up much of dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only remaining credit. In addition, a slight weakness that looks like a supportive comedy actor of the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. Rukh's young trophy woman (Drake), who falls head over for that human waste. If I grew horns, I wouldn't dr. Rukh (Karloff) any friendlier, so he starts in an undercover revenge mission ... kill 2 of his enemies and kind dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally succumb to the deadly radiation that allowed him to begin his revenge, but (to my greatest displeasure) the adultery and the poor excuse for a one saves her was married. Acting is mostly good, with Karloff & Lugosi very good. Look at the hysterical chamberist scene ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, much like ALL old universal horrors ...
