I watched it with my whole family as a 9-year-old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father that he "that's how it could have happened - Adam and Eve." I remember the scene if Adam found Adam, her eyes were black. I asked my father why her eyes became black and he told me she was tired and hungry. Having not seen this episode in 45 years, I still remember it brilliantly - the TV broadcasts back and forth with the home plan, screens of bombs shaking the headquarters, with the last scene of the two running away, Adam what she follows suit and Eve. It may not have been a theater art, but it has left me an impression for many years.
