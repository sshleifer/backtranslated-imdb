"One of Hung's better early attempts. The humor is dead in parts, since Hung is trying to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also in a little where Hung enjoys Jackie Chan's drunken master. Also pretty good, especially when Hung is doing a trio on fighting artists in the end, not the biggest movie, but pretty good for 70-year-old kung fu, especially if you are a fan of Hung and / or Lee. But most video versions of the movie have a shameful quality, and there is also a black-level character that some people may find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural swordherd who goes to Hong Kong move to fight some bad guys Sammo turn his dead Bruce Lee mimic when he fights! <br /> <br /> This movie is often shown as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon", but it's not Sammo is a rural pig shepherd - obsessed with Bruce Lee - moving to Hong Kong for his helping family run a small open-air restaurant. T he new job, he was forced to defend the dining room from local gangsters seeking security money. When Sammo turns off, he switches on his Bruce Lee imitation, which has to be seen to be believed! This movie is pretty messy. In many of the scenes, Sammo is fighting against people who are, of course, actors rather than martial artists. There is one character that must be black, played by an Asian man in heavy (and early) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy makes it more than in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
