The closest I've ever seen was a clip that was shown to a Gerard Philippe exhibition in Paris two years ago. I had no interest in the remake, and I just caught up to the original just over half a century after I made it. I can only conclude that the unfinished fence was deliberate, aimed at a long-dated target. Hollywood has done realistic sword battles since the 30's when most of them, Basil Rathbone, crossed films with Errol Flynn and others, leaving the technique available and leaving satire. After a while, you see and don't touch the Henri Jeanson dialogue that reminds both Van Zenda's prisoners. Gerard Philippe definitely had the presence of such a role and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a little better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate. The pressure I saw was especially bad and at one point it broke down completely. Maybe a DVD version will improve it.
