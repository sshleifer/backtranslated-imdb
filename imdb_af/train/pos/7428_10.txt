I swear when I first saw this movie, I called out my eyes! A STAR IS BORN is the movie with which you can know what love really is, despite the obstacles faced by John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience how it is to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such a great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand is singing With another look at you / Watch now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also love the fashion of the 70's (except Streisand's afro. In addition, she is a beauty.) A star is born my number one favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heartbreaker at the end.
