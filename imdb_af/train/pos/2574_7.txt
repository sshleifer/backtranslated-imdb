Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most gifted, and about the light comic actors of the past twenty years, looks back as detective Dooley for this movie. <br /> <br /> If you expect more The same from the first movie, you'll be disappointed, but it's still a good movie. Realizing that all the Dog vs. Man's battle of wills scenarios was probably used in the first movie, this one becomes slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with Dooley's newly-killed wife after she rejected his book, and blames Dooley for her death. <br /> <br /> The script may not be the best, but the film allows Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good acting ability while still having enough of the light humor of the first movie to leave it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is there for everyone to see. <br /> <br /> An easy, light movie, which, maybe it's not worth buying a purchase, unless you're a real fan of the first movie or Belushi, definitely a watch watch is when it comes to TV. <br /> <br />
