This series is "something else". Sometimes European series are less accurate than the US, but this time writers have set the right goal to create a blend that works smoothly. Noble & Starck is wonderful, it has everything: great plot, smart, witty, always well-rendered lines, a wonderful theater timing shown by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is entertaining to see how things work in the justice field in countries other than the US and to feel the old Europe's way of dealing with life. Kudos for all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that should be a must see in the coming year. Watching the series in German is super.
