Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a colleagues radical left. Mark is accused of killing a police force during a campus, and he flees all the way to the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane at the local airport and flying it himself. <br /> <br /> Once out of the desert, Mark marks a car from the air. A young woman named Daria steps out, and sees Mark circling the plane. Mark swoops the plane very low a few times, causing Daria one day or being hit. When he lands, he becomes familiar with Daria, who is strangely charmed by Mark's airline. <br /> <br /> After Mark and Daria worked for hours in soulful conversation, getting naked and making love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize he must keep running. So Mark and Daria's short picture is very poignant, as it is not developed in full-fledged romance. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was the early 70's Eraserhead. Both films have a winding, vague quality, along with intricate meanings and characters. Frechette was personally reckless, as was his character in this movie. A few years after making Zabriski point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving his imprisonment, Mark died an immortal death. He was killed with a weight of 150 lbs, which fell on him when he was gaining weight. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the beautiful cinematography and special visual effects. The incredible, slow-moving scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius. Although not such a movie as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point was still resonant with the early 70s counter-culture. I recommend it for those who watch tonight's movies showing the upheaval of the youth uprising in the early 70's.
