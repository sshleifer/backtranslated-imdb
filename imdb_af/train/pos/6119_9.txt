Okay, but not stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I was reading how people switched it to the Michael version and this is a good trick in my opinion because some adults hate hate horrors and when they see this one, they will be in horror movies like this one or maybe interested (never saw it) The horror (possibly comedy) Uncle Sam, I'll have to look at renting or buying the movie, but the 2nd is better than this one, but I bought this one on VHS from Amazon and November 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth four dollars, l.o.l. at this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
