This movie is one of the most challenging Jesus movies I've ever seen. It does not try to tell the whole story, but merely to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is dark, playful and faithful to elements of Jewish tradition and modern scripture interpretation. Judas is much more common than other depictions, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a very wrong man, terribly wrong in his zeal. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and dedicated - very human and also divine. The final dialogue is done well and serves as the kind of small talk that two mighty men can do if they just committed an atrocity. I'll watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
