This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and the reason I write it is that we talk about ONE of the best movies! "Ne goryuy!" will make you laugh and laugh at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not a fan!) with Georgian choral singing tradition, and perhaps you will accept the hardship of your own existence and just feel good after you look has it :) What I love much about this movie is that actors in the non-leading roles create lively and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character. The movie is Vahtang Kikabidze (who is wonderful), but you will remember every face around him in the movie. You will find your lines, which have become household names for so many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live with. Simple, but deep, you'll want to see it again.
