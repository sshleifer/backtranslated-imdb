From rainy, dry, late winter England from the early 1920s ... <br /> --- where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled veterinarians of the great blow of men and murderers of their wife's dreams - - known as the First World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this beautiful, small, sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who drowns her sadness twice, two women who will rediscover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her well-known dead friends ... <br /> <br /> ... These four Women will meet with two men and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for a wonderful April holiday in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> NOTE for the filmmakers. Study this movie for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a movie to please many men ...) <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE: Stop coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls over to some dry late winter day ... Spring is coming ... Delighted April promises you!
