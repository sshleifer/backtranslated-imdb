Visconti's first film has all its trademark visual flair and impeccable technique, accompanied by compelling performances by Massimo Girotti as the attractive driver and, best of all, Clara Calamai as the fantastic French Giovanna. Repeat several times as "The Postman Rings Twice" but never better. Can't believe it was the man's first movie! It shows someone's confidence at the height of their career.
