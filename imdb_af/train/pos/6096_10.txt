I know technically this is not the biggest TV show ever, I think it was shot on video and its limitations in both the audio and visual aspect. The scene can also be on time. But I love this show so much. I shook the hell out of it when it first came out in 1988. Of course I would be 5 years old. But I recently removed the DVD from the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear now, removed. And I also heard that Warner will no longer release because of the first DVD's bad sales. Also, the TV program didn't feel the same as the movies, and I thought it had a more sinister tone. Although the color palette is similar to the nightmare on Elm Street 4 (both that film and the TV show made the same year), it has more of a serious tone, while the fims have become increasingly sardonic and jokey. Not a bad thing, I like Freddy as the clown wise cracker. But I think it was the power of this TV show, you didn't have Freddy popping up every minute. Eventually a joke ripped before he and someone killed. In fact, it has more dream power, reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure whether it is deliberately off the shoulder or just to get the restrictions on video shot. I love this show, and not as a companion to the movies, can be very enjoyable. Much better than anything on TV today.
