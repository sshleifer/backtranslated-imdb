I understand that Paramount wanted to film it with the Rodgers and Heart score, but couldn't work out the copyright issues. Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote it between them, contributed most songs to Bing Crosby a very good score. <Br /> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin and say that this movie, "Crosby fits like a glove" and I couldn't do better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie and in 1949 Crosby was the most bankable star in Hollywood. For one time, Paramount engineering and Rhonda Fleming were never more beautiful on the screen. It was a woman after which technicolor was invented. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's Brooklyn origin is striking, but it's a good comic effect. The trio of Crosby, Bendix, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a good time with doing nothing. Bing has one of his patented optimistic philosophical numbers with stomping your toes on the moon. <br /> <br /> He is singing the third song for himself and with Rhonda Fleming. The song was nominated for the best song, but lost it to Baby. It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Also like Bing managed to record Decca's score with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I love the Road Photos, but Bing was a comic talent on himself and this movie shows better than any other. <br /> <br /> It's Crosby at the top of his game.
