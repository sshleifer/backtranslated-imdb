Full House is a wonderful sitcom about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife died just in a car accident. So Danny asks his son-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis, and best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help raise his three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show ever, and I can see it all day long. And something on the full house always makes me laugh and there are also sad parts. There is never a dull moment in the full house. The main characters are played by, Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Michelle Tanner) .
