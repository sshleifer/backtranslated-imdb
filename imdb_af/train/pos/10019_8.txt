When it comes to movies, I can be quite picky, and I will complain about anything and everything being done wrong. While each movie had its mistakes, The Night Listener had a particularly low score. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was difficult since half of it was written in caps and it doesn't contain real information about the movie), you might have led to believe that this movie isn't well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you discovered the poster's reason for contempt: he / she doesn't like the fact that the director is gay (or what the production team smokes, apparently ...). <br /> <br /> So, despite the fact that I've never written a review, I thought this movie deserves one because of its merit, not its director's sexual orientation. Let's first go over a quick checklist: 1. Big plot? Absolutely. I won't give away a piece of it, but the plot is very compelling and definitely not what one would expect from the ads. It's an excitement, not an abomination, and it should be approached as such. The story will really surprise you even more because it is true (and the plot was pretty true to the real events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful acting? Oh yes. Robin Williams has long since got rid of the chains of the comedy-type cast, and since then he has flourished in serious roles for which many people would have just written him a decade ago. He once again reaches high form in his role in The Night Listener, who plays a radio host who is becoming increasingly upset and entangled in a case of ... and I'll show you for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Definitely. Now, unlike the other poster I referred to, I actually know something about direction. I have been teaching the school for three years now. Of course, I really don't think what a licking difference makes (the only thing that matters is if you want the direction), but I thought I just had to re-establish my views on basic and relevant ... for example: not the director's sexual orientation (or the alleged production habits of the team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he has the corners and lighting to help create the so-called "tension and release" feelings rather than the messy, fast-paced camera work and fast cuts that we so often undergo. Some people can really tell you a story through their camera, while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone today has the courage to use only the camera as it is supposed to be used. It's like an eyeball we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great everywhere. I've written so much, and I could go through ten paragraphs on these last three things, so I'll just upload it. <br /> <br /> In short, look at this movie. Don't listen to people who have the leading motives to destroy it, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal the motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -benzoic
