It's a very attractive movie. The color photography is beautiful, as it shows the opulence of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color. Other indoor scenes at various homes, etc., are equally brilliant. As far as music is concerned, it can be said even more than that of Lanza's voice at his height when he sang so many of the world's best-known and beloved arias. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice reconciles with that of Lanza in glorious harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their usual freedoms with Caruso's life story. There is precious little in the story line related to actual events. For example, the facts related to his death are completely manufactured and do not relate to the truth. There are some very good sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These sites can be found using any good search engine. There are also several books on his life history available. But the fictional story line does nothing to mark this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten, and the choir members are the real stars of this movie. Enjoy, I know I did.
