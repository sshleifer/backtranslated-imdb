My name is Heather and I'm the girl whose story this movie was based. I want to thank everyone who saw this movie and enjoyed it. just as rough and hard as some of the things depicted in this movie, it wasn't really close to describing how bad things really were. not to mention the influence that everything had on my mother and little sister. Thanks again for the great comments everyone has, I really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Hi everyone! <br /> <br /> That's Heather's mother. It is hard to believe that so many years have passed since this movie was made. Harder to believe that people watched it a year ago. For any of you out there, who have gone through the same or similar kind of situation, please know that there are people here in cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
