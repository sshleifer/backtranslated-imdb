My choice for the best film ever was Laughton's "Night of the Hunter" which is excellent in my canon. But it may be replaced by "Douche", which is the most artistic Daoist movie I've seen. The way others care is represented by the flow of water and the way water can be inspired, comforted and cleansed, and so forth, is the essence of the Dao. It is possible to argue that the NOFTH and Douche themes are similar, and that Lillian Gish represents the purest form of Christianity in the former, as bathhouse operators represent the purest form of Daoism. I would in no way argue against such an interpretation. Both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image. Yet Douche offers such an unstated view of the holiness of everyday life that I nod. I respect both.
