WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs MVP in an Inferno game: So this is the fourth ever inferno match in the WWE and that's Kane vs MVP (wonder why this was the first game on the card). I just watched the end parts where Kane set fire to MVP's ass as they stood on the apron and then MVP walked around the arena while yelling? Eventually, the refs fired the fire with a fire extinguisher, as MVP ran around the input gear. Funny and visually pretty entertaining end. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: It was originally supposed to be William Regal and Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular team-team match. GM Teddy Long, however, comes to the ring and announces it will be a fatal 4-way team-team learning match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it's all chaos. One word to describe this eye-catcher ?? Wow. Man, I really can't remember how many sick places there were in this game and words can't really do it. There was a particularly striking spot where The Hardys saw a ladder in a position, and Jeff jumped from the top rope while Matt MNM killed for death, and then WHAM! Nitro blew away while Mercury believed it was bleeding and bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match alone. Another place was when Jeff clipped London while flipping off the ladder. There were other high-flying breathtaking places too much to remember. London eventually landed the belts to win this rave show stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman vs The Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for victory and then leaves worms over The Miz's mouth as usual fall. 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> United States Championship: Chris Benoit (c) stands for Chavo Guerrero in another typical Guerrero game. Some good spots included a super spot of the top rope at Chavo and an extraordinarily long chain of German suplexes by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the band to nail Benoit, but Benoit scares her and takes a long time to decide whether to place her in a Sharpshooter. It allows Chavo to roll up, but Benoit rolls it up again and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter. Game over. Beautiful hard battles, though slow at times. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for this one, in a fairly moderate fit. The game had some good high-flying spots? especially helms moving from the top rope? but the crowd failed to look at the learning game, and Yang had to get more air in the air. Helms won the game after he blew Yang with a face on the knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kennedy in a Last Ride game: After a series of matches between these two, this time it is a Last Ride game, the second ever in its kind the winner must accompany his opponent from the arena in a hearse. Pretty good indeed for what these two can offer. Kennedy handled a great deal of Taker and even broke a shock slam to throw Taker of the Armageddon set over 15 feet. and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy almost won the win until Taker returned to the hearse (I kept the camera view in the hearse). Taker then threw a steel pipe at Kennedy and broke the hearth of the hearse, but then Kennedy opened a chair and followed with a successive coke lock and Tombstone on the hearse roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I was really really interested in these guys' willingness to take / give real shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa comes in the ring, I'm going "what's the hell?" Like lots of kids in the crowd, and then the word 'lingerie match' gets in my ear. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker: Talk about charisma versus technical. This game was actually a very good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to another and maintaining good tension. Even this time Finlay had good legal shots on his opponents (I was similar to his strength towards the champion) and him and Booker didn't particularly try to cheat? except at one point where Booker tied his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista hit the bomb on Booker for victory, didn't see the F-U; Cena did anyway the 5 Knuckle Shuffle and I think he also did the STFU. It was probably the best technical game of the night and the contestants did extremely well for what they could without a learning 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> As a WWE fan, I have to agree that Armageddon was throughout many eyelids, and the battle finally swallowed half of the show; The Last Ride game occurred a few rather nervous spots, and the main event also did very well for his category. All the other games also delivered their bill, except perhaps the Boogeyman vs The Miz bolt and the one-day lingerie match. Overall Armageddon was a very enjoyable pay-per-view and, despite major setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wants this year's farewell with respect. PPV rating: 8/10.
