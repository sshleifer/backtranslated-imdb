Although at one point I thought it was going to go to The Graduate, I have to say that the mother does an excellent job explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad this is a British movie because Hollywood never did it and even if they had, they would ruin it by not taking the time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> The story is slowly and realistically revealed. The acting is wonderful, the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive. I often tried to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very inspired by the story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. And I have to confess, I'll see my mother forever in another light!
