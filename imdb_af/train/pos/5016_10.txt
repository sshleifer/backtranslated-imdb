This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his discomfort, linked to the boldness of Cheryl Pollak, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. Also, some of the characters have few lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves. Finally, the story is one that always drag my heartbeat, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a hearty, sentimental girl's night.
