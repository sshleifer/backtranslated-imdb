Mendez and Marichal gave us a serious, compelling and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that arose 108 years of colonialism in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I met and yet because our nation refuses to satisfy its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Rican can wither and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that created the colonial situation of Puerto Rico as families undermined and the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption is striking to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which led to a fiscal crisis for this nation) and a sense of cynicism and distrust has penetrated the island's culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a grant has this painful but powerful movie to be produced. <br /> <br /> a must see. . .
