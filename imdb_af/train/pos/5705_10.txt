A wonderful early musical film by Rene Clair, so funny and witty as she silent "The Italian Straw Hat". Clair influenced early musical in America (the opera scene of A Night at the Opera is heavily influenced by Le Million, for example). Must be (but not) seen by all cinephiles, and the Criterion DVD is exactly as good as you would expect. There aren't a ton of extras, but most of the DVD extras I've seen are useless, and the Clair disk drive is one I've never seen before. Get it while it's still around.
