This is the last Dutch film made by Paul Verhoeven before making the mainstream Hollywood films, "Basic Instinct," "Robocop," and "Total Recall" among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider overtaking prey on her web before we meet Gerard Reve, an annoying self-centered writer, with a morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to be a guest speaker from Amsterdam for an hour or so at a literary club meeting in the sea city. Verhoeven gives us a glimpse of how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. Asked if writers are a little near madness, he admits when he reads the newspaper and it says 'Boom'. I read "punishment" when it says "flood" I read "blood" when it says "red" I see "dead. "When he tells enough time about a story, he begins to believe it; "I lie the truth." He accepts an offer to be the owner of the club treasurer, a beautiful, rich salon owner. As he gets to know her and learns that her husband is dead, he thinks she is a black widow. "Is this his more reality twist or is she a murderer? This is a psychological drama and in telling which of these old movies I have trapped in my memory, I figured out my favorite generation. Looking at his work, it also seems to be Paul Verhoeven, and he is a master to question our own understanding of reality. It's a nice pace change from the regular Hollywood prize. I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that is "stuck".
