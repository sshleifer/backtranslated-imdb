A beautiful memorable melodrama? thanks mainly to Ronald Colman's fine Oscar-winning central achievement ?? about an often treated theme: the nature of acting and how it can overtake one's perception of reality. In this case, we have a well-known Thespian that tackles the Shakespeare's Othello, so the last third of the movie goes effectively into the thriller genre? with the press agent Edmond O'Brien (who is actually detected with Colman's co-star and ex-wife Signe Hasso) 'investigates' the actor's possible involvement in the Desdemona-like strangulation of a celebrity-seeking waitress (a lot of slim shelley winters). The theater / New York atmosphere of the immediate post-war era is captured alive by screenwriter Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and legendary actor director George Cukor (all of whom the Academy has nominated); By the way, the film nabbed a second Oscar for Miklos Rozsa's eclectic score. Colman, forever the southern leading man to be blessed except with a velvety voice, does it well by Shakespeare ?? convincing the further his character slips into obsessive jealousy, murderous anger and ultimately paranoia; However, he is not dropped by a supportive role which also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and reviewer Whit Bissell. Although the middle part is slightly tense, the film makes some shortcomings with remarkable handling of expressionist denial.
