It's a horror movie based TV show that gets it right. On Friday the 13th, the series had no connection with the movies. Poltergeist the legacy: I'm not so sure. It may be loosely linked to the movies. It feels like they're just throwing a well-known title on show, so fans will see it. <br /> <br /> It shows that Freddy is being burned by the Elm Street parents (in the first episode I believe) and the number of parents was disappointing. With all the kids he has targeted in the 1st 3 movies, you can expect more parents. But oh well. <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically the narrator for the show. He watches how the actions of people in the real world sometimes get involved in some way. Just like other anthology, like Tales from the crib, there is a supernatural or surprising ending. <br /> <br /> The play is missing, but believe it or not: violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie. This show lasted a few seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. I heard it was canceled because of parents' protests. I looked at many R-rated things as a child, so it's a pity that parents have to destroy it for everyone. Another 4 movies came after the series, so it wasn't a total loss.
