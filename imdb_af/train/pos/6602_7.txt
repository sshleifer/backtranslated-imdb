Similarly, Frank Miller and his Sin City comics used black and white to express themselves (and his film noir influences), as well as Christian Volckman with the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> This is the year 2054, in Paris. In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright, sparkling jewel. It is a gem in an environment of misery, inequality and darkness; Bright and beautiful on top with a dark lower abdomen. One of these "bright" people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well-known and efficient Captain Karas (voiced by the new James Bond himself - Daniel Craig) has the task to find her. <br /> <br /> The plot and layout are not too original. It is strongly influenced by film noir, Gibson's Neuromancer and other detectives, along with films such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang's Metropolitan and Minority Report. There is the main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end. It's not hard to figure out everything. <br /> <br /> The film's strength and originality is in its intense visual representation. Paris is a complex variety of levels and sub-levels. At its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city emerges, it also does its architectural complexity and luminescence. Yet, in this structure, the summit does not compare with elevation of human ideals and behavior. Paris is intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white. The film is closer in spirit with Sin City (the comics) and Sin City was the movie with its source material. This is getting easier because it is still in the same medium; animation. In the same way as a scanner, the visual aspects of storytelling have been drunk, so do it. The light and dark, black and white create an atmosphere of contrasts as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us. The film shows how black and white can both be ambiguous and obvious. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the spirit of the movie, I can be both a critic and a fan. I can love and love in the same light. This is definitely an experience I recommend for lovers of the visual arts. So throw another Black and Tan, get into the void and enjoy the ride.
