Sometimes I look at a movie and is it really impressed? And it's still not easy to explain why I liked it so much. It is mostly true for the unusual movies ?? one can hardly compare with the rest out there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special movies. There is a lot of emotion in that movie ?? And the acting was so good that while I watched the movie, I cried and laughed while the story went on. The young Nick Robinson ?? a young boy (William) was evacuated from London because the air stopped there during World War II. Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man who leaves in the village where the desolate children are sent. <br /> <br /> For the first time, Tom refuses to take any responsibility - like caring for a troubled young boy? but accept because he is left without choice. During the stay, Mr. Tom how terrible life is for William? next to his luggage, his mother sent a belt and sent written instructions to the host of her son? not to hesitate to use it. This band is berried in the field ?? never used in such a cruel way. Mr. Tom is a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, going to school, making new friends, and discovering hidden talents. All of a sudden a letter William was brought to London, with a letter mentioning that she did not feel good and it all started again? only this time it gets much worse? There are many feelings you can feel in this movie ?? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of the British cinema that can only be compared to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? if one should be compared. I really enjoyed viewing it and strongly recommending it. Before I complete this review, do I also want to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac? reminded me of a friend of my own childhood (:
