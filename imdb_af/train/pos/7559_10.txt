This movie is just as good! Despite Carmen Electra, it has to be one of the better movies I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing, and Loren Dean plays a crazy spoiled movie star very well. The plot is also good. It's all very real, which is frightening. It says here it is a drama, but it is one of the most funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go look it out.
