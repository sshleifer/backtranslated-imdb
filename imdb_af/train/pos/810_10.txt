This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV - spatial cabaret music and a cabaret scene, where the seriousness of mobster Jabba the Hutt became even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in a basement pit through the Bantha legs, which looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi forces eventually end the monster. Jabba was very angry at the fact that Luke was sentenced to die outside the Sarlacc pit. <br /> <br /> But all the Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and the other ideas finished the execution of Luke. Eventually most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia could use the power to kill Jabba deadly. <br /> <br /> As in Episode IV, Death Star looks like Episode VI. When I discovered the rebel fleet that attacked the Imperial Fighters for the Death Star, the Star Destroyer staff, I suspect, was chasing the main laser warming, using the Imperial fighters as a distraction. The 20-25 Star Destroyers set up were ready to attack, but were called out and the Death Star was shot in surprise. Only when it was fired was the rebel fleet's only hope that the Death Star deflector shield would be eliminated. It affected Lando so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but he couldn't until the shield was pulled out. And it was pulled out with Lando's increasing impatience. <br /> <br /> As in Episode V, the Imperial Walkers make their imminent appearance with their twin guns, killing at least one of the Ewoks ... but the Ewoks have ancient yet unusual ways to handle it. For example, Chewbacca, as well as another Ewok, was able to command one of the hikers (and it actually used to destroy one of the hikers) and the other Ewoks used logs to remove two other hikers. to switch. <Br /> <br /> It's amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi forces on his Light Saber, such as the scene at Endor where Luke deflects incoming laser shots of a Storm Trooper speed bike and uses the Saber to launch knock part of the bike. Or, in a climax, the Saber used to break his own father's arm during the last Saber battle with Sith Father. <br /> <br /> You probably know the Ewoks celebration after the star-star has been blown, completed with a brief display of fireworks, drums over the victory spoil (eg Storm Trooper Masks), and Luke finally ends with Leia to Luke's own nemesis. --- Darth Vader, now dead, is burned on a stream. The celebration includes Ewoks song, but I don't think Lucas bought it - even with the strong respect of film composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> On the home movie version, I think Lucas wanted another end. In addition to the celebration at Endor, he wanted shots of festive scenes on the various surviving rebel planets, including a festive laser shot that destroyed the Sith statue. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that the galaxy with the galaxies had restored the restoration of the galaxy.
