For a comedy, it has a decent and inventive plot and Trey Parker and Matt Stone's comic timing is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments for this fantastic movie. I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena screens. Robert Stacks Unresolved Mysteries spoof is also very amusing.
