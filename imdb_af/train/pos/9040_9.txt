A true, healthy American story about teens interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town, following the launch of Sputnik in 1957. <br /> <br /> Through trial, tribulation and Perseverance is unaware that they are ultimately able to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as leader of the group, is excellent in the title role. As his motivational science teacher, Laura Linney is pretty good, but her southern accent is over. <br /> <br /> There is a strikingly supportive performance by Chris Cooper, a chief worker, who wants his son to be in his footsteps, but gradually comes to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so unusual for our time is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. This is the hallmark of a well-done American story. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific angle, we have the father-son disagreement, soccer bursaries as a way to escape coal mine, and the loving spirit of family. <br /> <br /> Why aren't photos like this being recognized during awards?
