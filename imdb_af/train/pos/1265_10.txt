Hello. I just think one of my favorite Sean Connery's movies is a tense psychological thriller with excellent cast performances, especially Connery. It also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies. The dialogue is therefore pretty good in this one. It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when Sean interviewed. Ed Harris's character in jail is just fantastic. I really enjoyed it and I can't recommend it enough. Don't really miss it. this one! Don't pay attention to the negative reviews that say the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really find Just cause a very entertaining movie ..
