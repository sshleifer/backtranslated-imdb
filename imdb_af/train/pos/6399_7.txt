Although definitely not the best movie I have ever seen, it was definitely worth the $ 8 (it can't be said for many movies today.) <br /> <br /> A true story, although many of the details of the real story were turned into the movie, (Billy Sunday's character was three or four in the right story.) Of course, Robert DeNiro was good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. , was also impressive.
