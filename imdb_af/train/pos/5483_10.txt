I really enjoyed "The Revolution Will Not Be Broadcast". This again gave me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to govern. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that in Venezuela, the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made everything the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. But when their coup failed; After the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman and the electoral council and all civil rights, no one took and plotted the plotters behind a shed. They weren't even in jail. The big plotters live in Florida and carry on. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" which was transmitted by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just history that bites. Democracy can give you a helper if you lose it. And in Venezuela it is loose.
