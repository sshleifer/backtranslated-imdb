I often wondered how much CASPER was meant for children ... with all the issues surrounding his identity (in this film we believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his home is a cemetery ), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular movie. Perhaps Casper is more of a morality game, or Famous Studios felt their new ground breaking into 'reality' cartoons. <br /> <br /> THIS IS GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well-animated project, no doubt there. But the plot development involving the fox (which becomes Casper's friend but with a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Give Famous Studios Credit - They Take Death With Respect ... But The Strong Picture Of Casper's Mourning Is Quite Graphic And Disturbing To Children (Although Denial Has A Happy End, But I will not end), and violence is quite steep, even for the 1940s. <br /> <br /> It may be a good cartoon for parents to help explain death to children - But I won't pop it in the video recorder for a beautiful cartoon break.
