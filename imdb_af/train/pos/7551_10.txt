Best animated movie ever made. This film not only explores the great world of modern animation with absolutely captivating effects, but the branches of human mind, soul and philosophy. The story features a family of cats, where the big sister dies, the younger brother sees it and saves her body, but when she awakens, she is left without soul. So the two brothers and sisters start a journey to find it. I related this journey to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I see it, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so in the physiological aspect of it, you will still worship it. The animation is great, and the creative scenes will have attached you to the screen. For example, the ocean freezes in time, god eats soup from the earth, a strange and slightly repetitive of Hansie and Gretel. In conclusion, Cat Soup is an absolute pleasure for anyone. <br /> <br /> PS Not for children, free violence included.
