Wow ... I don't know what to say. I just watched seven pounds. Nobody can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very much in line with the great variety of human emotions. This movie is skillful and beautifully done. Rare to find such an intense humanity in Hollywood. I will compare it to "Pay It Forward" and "Crash" as it is the display of both light and dark in such a rough way. Certainly stick with you for a long time and give you lots to think about. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this one. Not usually one for a bad end, but rather a truth seeker who embraces emotion, grief, and something more than the abomination that abounds. That's why I don't end up with a bit of pain. It is true for life that there are not always happy ends. Sometimes it's just not the happy ending you think it should be. Many people could live happy lives, even though love and life were lost. If you are someone who looks deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
