I agree with everyone who says this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were enchanted by it when it first broadcast in the US and watched every episode. At the time I tried to buy the series (I left it all), but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever becomes available on DVD, I would be the first to make a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was wonderful. (He is always wonderful.)
