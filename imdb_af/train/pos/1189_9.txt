The last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to hunt Buffalo, both as a sport and business, and as a method to win the plains of Indian wars. Before the white man was sitting on the other side of the Mississippi foot, the plains had US troops as big as some of our biggest cities. By the time of the last hunt, the buffaloes were all but wiped out. The 20th century saw a revival in the population of the species due to the efforts of conservation officials, but not as little as it ever was. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger play together in a second movie and this one is much better than all the brothers. Here Stewart Granger is the good guy, a world-wide buffalo hunter, who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations. <br /> <br /> The partner he chose was Robert Taylor. Taylor forgot about the moment, I doubt if there is ever a common, nastier soul than Charlie Gilsen who portrays Taylor. In Devil's Doorway he was an American Indian fighting the prejudice raised by a Louis Calhern racist. In The Last Hunt he is the racist here. He kills buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills one Indian family when they steal his mules and take the widow of one prisoner. Like some barbarian victor, he expects the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. He's actually angry when Paget doesn't see it like that. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a half-width, I was never really convinced he was a part of India. This is the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> But Lloyd Nolan, the grizzled old buffalo rider Taylor and Granger, just brings big. Nolan steals every scene in which he is involved. <br /> <br /> For those who want their Western true, who wants to see Robert Taylor never seen on the screen and who doesn't like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunting.
