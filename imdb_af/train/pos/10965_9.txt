Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that everyone can feel compassionate. Although their home was dirty, it is somehow understandable considering their mental illness. On the message board, a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the handling skills of an eight-year-old." It reminded me when in the dramatized 2009 version, Big Edie told Little Edie, "If you're stuck, it's just with yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and deeds. Maybe if Little Edie wasn't so hard on herself, things didn't work out the first time, lost her hair, her work and the love of her life, she'd made it. It's somehow related to what I believe is her mental illness: her inability to pick herself up when times are difficult and good times ahead. The world will never know what happened if she hadn't listened to her mother's plea: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> But these understandably unsafe women somehow succeed brilliantly, heartbreaking, and lovely, even in their extremely filthy home. These women were extraordinary, and their interaction with one another brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional breakdowns, about what could have been, or how she'd come out of her house, because she felt like a girl, she got the intense urge to hug her and tell her that " everything will be fine! "<br /> <br /> Great Documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
