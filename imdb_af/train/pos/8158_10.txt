"Fear of a black hat" is all that the (much weaker) "CB-4" should have been. Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is relentless, as he folds, spatulas and mutilates every aspect of hip hop trends and culture. Find "FoaBH" like spinal tap? Yes a little. Is it derived from spinal tap? No not really. The goal is more focused, the satire is better focused, and to be honest, it is more beautiful.
