It's one of the biggest movies I've ever seen: I have penetrated the whole movie. The music and cinematography kept the game going when there was little on the screen. The slow pace is determined by the means of transport (a large trailer driving lawnmower) and is maintained by the background and sounds and the slow life of the other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was really real, as if the actors had actually changed into the characters. Sissy Spacek had an accomplished performance as a somewhat handicapped daughter who suffered a lot but forged, and always wanted to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he visited Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man, about Iowa, his strange brother Lyle. He had a stroke. Alvin learned a lot of wisdom in his life and it seemed as if he was the best in the people he experienced. <br /> <br /> The movie highlights the importance of family for this man and hopefully for all of us. I'd like to expect it again and again. Directed by David Lynch, these films prove his direct skill. Farnsworth is nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.
