"One shot, one kill, no exceptions." A must see if you are in marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! Great overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more. Nice close to the right thing. But it's not a movie to break in and choose the editing errors. It is to sit back and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this movie doesn't really make you think. It's about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups, but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a great job of playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper's life. the level of dealing with all death. Must watch for sniper fans.
