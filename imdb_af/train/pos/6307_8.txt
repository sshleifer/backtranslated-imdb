I have never heard of this movie, despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company manufactures and he looks in a very funny supporting part) and his ocean 11 director Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we picked it up in a $ 4.99 discount box (Canadian dollars!) What a great and enjoyable surprise. But then I think if William H. Macy is there, you can't be disappointed. It was very reminiscent of the Ealing comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, with more curse. It's a strange ball and sometimes funny funny movie. The real elevator made me laugh so hard, I cried. Perhaps the funniest use of briefs in film history. Perhaps it was the low expectations I had, but I looked at a group of people and we had an explosion. Dear $ 5 I have been spending these days.
