As a habit I always like to read through the 'hated' reviews of any given movie. especially one that I want to comment on. and it is not so much a point-counterpoint sorta agreement; I just want to see what people say on the flipside. <br /> <br /> But I want to address one thing. many who hated it called it paraphrase, "beautiful but level," some even go so far as to say that the norm's desire is still inability to help his brother was at best a everyday plot. <br /> <br /> I don't want to agree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a brother or sister who has a similar dysfunction, I can relate it. Every day you see them abusing themselves, just knowing that their current path will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and it is not about the details of what they did; how or why did Paul decide to accept gambling and associate with dubious people; It's really more how they are wired. on the one hand, it is true geniuses, and on the other hand, painfully self-destructive (it is much like people like Howard Hughes, the same forces they manage are the same forces they tear apart) and all the time you see it. You, and what's worse, you realize you can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> For Norman Maclean, a river runs through it was probably a way to find out why the tragedy had to take place and who had to blame. In the end, nobody is, and often there is no reason. but it takes a lot of personal anxiety to really come to this realization. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes.
