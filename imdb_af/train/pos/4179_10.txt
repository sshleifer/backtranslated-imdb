This is the story of the Australian commandos who are taken after a uniform attack. Being out of uniform, they are treated fairly as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The Japanese war council, admiring their heroism, empowers them to get a warrior's death. Of course, under the code of Bushido, it means being beheaded. A lot for what, like Westerners, they are unprepared for.
