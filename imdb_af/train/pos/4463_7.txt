A recent view of DITTER BUSINESS has been urging me to watch many of the classic MGM musicals of the 1940s and 1950s. ANCHORS AWEIGH is definitely a smaller movie than on the city. The songs are not so good, nor the chemistry between the characters. But the film is beautifully entertaining classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene at the Hollywood bakkie, with Sinatra and Kelly coming out of the forest above it, and then down the stairs, while dozens of pianists playing on the piano, is the best scene in the movie, though Kelly's scene with Jerry Mouse is more known. Classical music enthusiasts will undoubtedly identify the music the pianists play. Sinatra crown, "I'm in love too easily," before his epiphany about who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and pollution-free air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the middle of the 1940s?!), And the piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had a flair to create lyrical moments like this.
