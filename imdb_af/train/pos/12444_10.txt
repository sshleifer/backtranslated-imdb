The best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's like a good pilot for a TV show. I think it's even a bit of a cult, like a little bit of Quentin Tarantino's magic, or something. They caught a lot of modesty character, but I admit that Willy Garwin misses a little. Even if I read a lot of comics and book by Peter O'Donnell, I'm not disappointed with this movie, rather the opposite. Positively surprised by this story about modesty and her childhood. I did not set my expectations so high because of the bad film of 1966. So I can only overestimate this movie. But if you like the comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this one! can't wait for a follow up ...
