This movie is excellent, you never have to wait for a stomach laugh to stand up for more than a minute, and much more than the initial depiction of the movie. Throughout there are mockers of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-well-overcome adversity genre of which these parodies. Don't let anyone tell you they're trying to get cheap laughter just by using obsessions; Sure, there are a lot of them, but it's all contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so in terms of entertainment for money, it's the best movie I've seen this year.
