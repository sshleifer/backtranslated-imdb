I investigated this film a little and discovered a website that claimed it was actually an inside joke about the Post-WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the war gates and witches represent the alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the stage play, was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade, just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me into a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns or alien monsters and I was planning to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and took off his hat while the camera followed. As the glorious George Duning love theme grew, I suddenly had a feeling of falling in love. The first stirring of romantic / sexual love left me when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's staggering, direct look. It is ironic that a gay parable in so many of us started to start heterosexual puberty. I was in my late 50's and watched the movie again last night and had the same feelings as I watch the hat touch fifty years later. . .
