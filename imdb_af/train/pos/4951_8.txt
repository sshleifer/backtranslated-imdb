In all honesty, if someone told me that the director of Lemony Snicket's series of unfortunate events, City of Angels and Caspers, is going to do a neat, low-budget indie movie and that would be really good, I would person says must joke. But that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 Items of Less" has a similar look to movies like "Before Sunrise," "Lost in Translation," or more recently "Once." It involves the accidental encounter of two people. If serendipity did not put them there, they would probably never cross roads, or if they did, they would not say one word to each other. Like those movies, "10 items or less" focus on the relationship that builds and how the characters get to know each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story involves Morgan Freeman, playing an unnamed actor who will investigate his role as a grocery employee for an emerging independent film and eventually spend the day with things beyond his control. lady in the 10 items or less lane played by Paz Vega. She has a rotten marriage and hopes to find a new job as secretary. Initially, Freeman's character only needs a lift. After spending time with her, however, he wants to get to know her and maybe even give her advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling almost completely builds the characters through the exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is just a set-up for these two characters to communicate with each other for most of the movie's 80-minute duration. Freeman has fun with his character, as he appears to be an outsider in the lower class world inhabiting Vega's character, Scarlett. Vega, meanwhile, is growing beyond the stubborn accomplishment clerk troubled by the situation of her life and trying to continue. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that really stand out in this movie. Firstly, Siberling probably took note of independent theater to make sure the relationship is genuine and does not fall into any Hollywood pitfalls. It is a very mutual friendship that convincingly develops through the film. It works, even though the situation itself seems a little unthinkable. <br /> <br /> I'm also impressed with the performances. While Freeman's presence gives this movie credibility from the get-go, he shows some charm and pleasure that is not usually seen of him. In the meantime, Paz Vega is a breakthrough in American film. I loved her in Spanglish and she is as good here as the tough, no-nonsense Scarlet. By the end of the film, she successfully contributes to the growth of her character. I look forward to seeing her in more movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 Items of Less features is best as a character piece, well written and directed by Brad Siberling. He did not write much and his film work mostly consisted of major Hollywood films. Yet there is definitely an artist at work here and I am anxious to see if he will take this road again.
