DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a great surprise. It features excellent acting (especially the underrated Callan), fine cinematography and a compelling story. In other words, it's one of the best horror attempts to get out of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who has dreams of killing his models, at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically brief brother (who lacks an arm and a leg). When the models that Callan's dream to kill come to mind, the photographer begins to doubt his own common sense ... but there is more to the picture than he sees. <br /> <br /> This film never received praise. earned. Most critics and filmmakers beat it along with the horde of the films released at the same time, but it is high above most of the pity. It's smart and unique, it's not something you can comfortably say about most movies of this genre, but it is also passionately produced and executed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a jewel of its kind.
