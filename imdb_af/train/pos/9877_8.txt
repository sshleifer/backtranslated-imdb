<br /> <br /> The presentation of Lily Mars is one of a genre of movie that unfortunately disappeared with the studio system. Well now that you know my bias, there are a few reasons I think this movie comes from. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a beautiful Hollywood story of the period. The authors change the theme a little more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star goes, she's not successful and she must be proud and go back to playing a less important role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (said enough!) <br /> <br /> 3. The supporting film also includes very good performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is really great, just like Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). However, the strikingly supportive performance goes to character actor Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, a once-off actress turned theater. <br /> <br /> Guarantee a watch for sure. One of those movies designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
