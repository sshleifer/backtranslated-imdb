A wonder. One of the best musical ever. The three Busby Berkely numbers ending in the movie are spectacular, but what makes the movie so great is the incredible non-stop patter and natural play of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also nice, although she may not have been a great actress). There is a freshness in the movie that you do not see in flashes today, much less in the usually stolen 30s movies, although the plot, which deals with movie prologues, is fairly dated.
