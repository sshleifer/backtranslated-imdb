I have never seen this movie before buying the tape last year. I was surprised and entertained. It has all the elements of what I love to see in a Sci-Fi story, in a book or on the screen. There are social comments, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something weird and amusing, look at a 1936 view of the 'distant future' of the 60's and 70's. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see, not just Sci-Fiers.
