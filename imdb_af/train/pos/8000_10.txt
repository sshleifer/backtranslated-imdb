... does not read any summaries of summaries, because in the words the plot may seem trivial, brain-dead and useless. The movie is excellent, the acting of both Denzel and Dakota (she's going to be sky-high, trust me about it) is just fantastic, and the plot is blowing. Actually, "fabulous" is a small word for such talented actors. The movie is just based on real facts and some characters are not fiction, a fact that adds the shock I had during and after the movie. If you love both actors and somewhat disturbed movies, you haven't seen your favorite one yet. Trust me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is wonderful, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... don't miss it
