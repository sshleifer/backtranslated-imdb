This is where the term "classic film" comes from. It is a wonderful story of a woman's courage, courage and utmost loyalty. Poor Olan was sold to her unconscious man, who over the years has learned to appreciate her. (Yes, a pearl!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was the beautiful star that Oscar won the best actress Oscar for her little role (and what a waste of an oscar) in "The Great Zigfield ". It really didn't show what, if any, talent she had as her exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she also had no costumes. People say she doesn't show real emotions in this movie. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and rude woman, with inner power. She was silent during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. For example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were shot. If you say she's not doing well in this movie, you don't look! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows he can act. His character is not a parable to me. He never sees her for what she is until the end of the story. A sweet loving and dedicated woman and mother, with her own special beauty. The biggest of all, the beauty of the inside, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best films that created the golden age of Hollywood.
