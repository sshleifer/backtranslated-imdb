I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for everyone. It's a movie to watch far with your family. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, long-lasting scenes of death, nudity / sexuality and some language.
