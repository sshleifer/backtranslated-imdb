I think it's a good version I came here to help me determine which version to use and went to Jane Eyre in 1983 and read a comment from users' comments and helped me to get this version get. I'm not sorry to choose this version, nor you. I tried to look at all the other versions and there was nothing wrong with it. There is nothing like the book, and TRUST ME when you read the book, you want something that will suit it. If you really look for something and move after reading the book, it's difficult because you want something that matches it. I would say that God personally led me to this version. It indicates true love for a person. I would say God's love is greater. If there is something better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is no one like this!
