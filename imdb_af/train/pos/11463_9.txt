I watched this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away. The structure and performance of the movie was fantastic ... I know it won't, but it really deserves an Oscar wink. Cal and Andr√© were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates. Yes, the movie is very controversial and I see a lot of people with a lot of trouble, as it deals with school shooting and especially with the killers. However, despite his hard and blunt topic, Zero Day is worth watching. I look forward to getting it on video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the end shoot sequence makes you speechless because it's almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, the "recordings", the visuals and the panic of the students, are totally indescribable. I really hope it gets the attention it deserves. This is done in the same format as The Blair Witch Project, handheld camera, which is regarded as a true home video documentary type of film - but God is the INFINITIVE better. Very impressive, beware of everyone involved. If you get the chance, you really should see it.
