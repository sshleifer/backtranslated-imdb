It's a good performance, and I find it funny. Finally, the bad Latin stereotypes are over! Gracias, Se√±or Lopez! I love this show, and I just started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of a Latin family TV show really surprised me. I'm surprised that Latin finally has a good shot to be on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, it's funny, heart-warming, touching and fun.
