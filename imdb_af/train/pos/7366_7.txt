It's a movie that the mainstream market is unlikely to ever get, as it's not easy to see. The story about upset Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie, but has its own unique edge and I found it entertaining. There are moments of glory as the film was shot at such a low budget, as when Spike breathed the aerosol. However, I didn't really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest, made me spend most of the movie working it out. And also I didn't like the fact that most of the movie is spent with the two friends and not really much "action". It's a small movie that is complex to watch and makes it attractive.
