My expectations were pretty high for this movie. Everyone I know who watched this movie at the cinema told me that everyone had been through the credits because they were so touched. My expectations could not have been higher, and nothing but wonderful would have disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I was anything but disappointed by this movie. I loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps that a Hollywood movie tends to include. In this film, characters worked through problems they've had for decades, worked through prejudices, learned to open. But it didn't come easy, not just by singing a song or two. It was painful, it took arguments, it took confrontations. It felt like real life. <br /> <br /> One scene that really struck me was the scene in which Gabriella sang her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful, and you can tell that she didn't just sync lips with a previous recording during filming (which I often find in other movies), she really has with her body sung and soul. You can feel what Gabriella felt in that scene. If this movie was made in Hollywood, her song would probably be sung to the end, and it would open her husband and see the mistake of his ways, as well as make the other people in the village realize or two. Instead, it came halfway through, and it didn't bring any solutions. Her husband did not become overwhelmed and realized what he was spending her time, and it seems as if someone else in the town is more open-minded. It was beautiful, it was pure and it was falling, but it didn't solve all her problems. It really felt to me, that's probably what happened in real life. The whole movie felt like real life, nothing neatly wrapped, but all with a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie that feels so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that bother me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you haven't done that yet, you should see how it is in heaven and filled with joy for life, a sense of hope and the feeling that you have been touched on shallow films rarely reach. You will be sad, painful, happy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if every person in the world was singing in a choir, there would be no more wars. After watching this movie, I might have to agree.
