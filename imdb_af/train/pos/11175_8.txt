A major part of his success is Miko Hughes as baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really work like his parents. There is a scene where Louis Gage hugs, and they are very obvious. Fred Gwynne is wonderful. He nails the Maine accent perfectly without decaying, and is wise and warm like Jud. (8 out of 10)
