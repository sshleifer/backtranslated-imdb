Broadway and movie actor-turn director John Cassavetes (of Rosemary's Baby) create a masterpiece with this 1977 film. These are stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a comedy by Peter Falk. The Assumption of the Movie: An aging phase and film actress (Gena Rowlands) re-judges her life after an unsolicited fan dies in a car accident and tries to get her signature. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, naughty, terrifying quality. It has a movie's appearance of 60 and it even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the one that every successful actress has - she gets old and she will become useless in her career. She also feels that she has lived a life that has no true spirituality, humanity and merit. She lived alone for her career - she has no children, does not do charitable acts, and so on. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She fell apart. She's in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the character's painful psyche and does the part very well. She is a terrific actress and this 70's movie is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the era and whether the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. It is a movie with very deep emotion, but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes criticized the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's. It is also a product of the 70's, which was cynical in many ways. Nixon's fraud, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not good and this film is not known, it is a very ghostly film. with haunting moods. Kudos to the subordinate and leaves director Cassavetes dead in the late 80's.
