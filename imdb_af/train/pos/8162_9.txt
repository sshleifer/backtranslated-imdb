Like dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen becomes a wonderfully confused show in "The Tandarts". <br /> <br /> With its overall obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the IRS beat him and a very suspicious acting woman; Dr Alan Feinstone loses his common sense every day. <br /> <br /> When the Doc realizes that his wife has a relationship with the local pool, it sets off a series of events that lead to torture, murder, ant total chaos! "The Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes the character of dr. Party tones comparable and hateful at the same time. Even though he is completely out of his gourd, the audience still feels sympathetic to him. That my friends ..... damn good. <br /> <br /> A fun solid role-players from supporting actors around this gem of a movie. Excellent direction, good murders and gore, and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> REVISED RECOMMENDATIONS!
