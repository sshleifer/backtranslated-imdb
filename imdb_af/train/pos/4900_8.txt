It's a strange movie that the British do so well. Low budget, cameo type roles, well executed. The story is a bit weak, a recent widow, Judi Dench, decides to erect the "blonde bumshells" an overall girl band that performed during the London war. The obligatory boy / daughter who thinks she is a pot. Like the way the movie shows young people, they have no monopoly on feelings, love and even desire. That the "old wrinkles" can also have a good laugh. Judi Dench was excellent as always, sorry, we didn't see more of the others "blonde bombeshells, the end was a bit rushed, I thought. I thought when I looked at David Jason a better Patrick as Ian Holm would have been, though quite reasonable as the "transvestite" drummer. All in all, a joyous movie worth a night in the girls :)
