Don't read anything about this movie (especially anything that spoilers may contain). Just look at this wonderful movie without knowing it - and you'll have a great experience. If you want to see an intelligent, twisted story: Go, get the DVD and you really won't be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, more a psychotherapist based around the globalized business. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy each other's research departments and the methods they use. The actors do a good performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect cooling state. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and involves the story and the end - much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali's other movie "Cube" and "Nothing". Actually, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I really don't say about every fifth well-made movie). Sorry, you can tell nothing more about this movie without harming your experience. Just give it a chance. ;-)
