Robert Taylor as the crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. Initially I thought Charlie would eventually lose himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the movie goes, Gilson keeps even more atrocities until you realize there's no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that buffalo will soon be gone and become disgusting by the deadly act. Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or humans. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character in the light of the self-imposed censorship of that time. She resigned to Gilson in total resignation, though she hated him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson is memorable.
