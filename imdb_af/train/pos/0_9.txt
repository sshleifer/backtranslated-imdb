Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as other school life programs, such as "Teachers". My 35 years in the teaching profession led me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than "teachers". The concern to survive financially, the insightful students who can see straight through their pathetic teachers' pump, the concern of the whole situation, reminds me all of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode where a student repeatedly tried to burn off the school, I immediately remembered ......... by .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to drop one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age think Bromwell High is over. What a pity this is not!
