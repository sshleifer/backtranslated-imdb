It's an extraordinary movie that constantly offends you. It seems to be heading on several points to cliche, and then something amazing will happen that really starts. It will give too much to say more, but stick to this movie and you'll be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely beautiful - he is definitely a star who deserves to be rediscovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is incredible. There is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford is cold). Both actors subtly play this subtitle with a great depth of emotion, so there are moments that move a lot. And I never thought I could get involved in a soccer game like I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines rival for the girl (yes, it's not quite a gay movie). Wonderful quiet classic - a good example of the 20-year-old commercial theater with a border.
