It's not well shot, well written or performed well, but it has to be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is so time-consuming that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. They even slowed down the pace of the show, revealing only small amounts of information per episode, but they were just telling you what you wanted to know. However, some of the plays are just awful and some of the duos are really brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko are really about the actors playing Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating, as the next episode may not show the previous episode. Annoying syllables have become part of the story that sometimes tells you nothing. However, the second season has evolved to a point where recollections reveal more about the island than they had before. All in all, it's a good performance, but not perfect.
