I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is wonderful and exciting. <br /> <br /> It could have used a little more screen time for the nice Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was incredibly "on it" from the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> The one that surprised me by surprising shock and awe and wonder was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I worship him in Forsyte Saga, and all the others I saw him. But he made him out here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams I couldn't have imagined playing a demented psycho like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I love it. And I love him.
