For the first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie, we watched it for Alex Winter from "Bill & Ted's" boast. We didn't know what to expect except who and what it was about. <br /> <br /> By the time the movie was over, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, while not quite historically accurate, was and is the best of its genre. I have seen other movies depicting the history of this well-known summer and none of the others can compare. It had a bit of some detail, but those parts didn't turn away from the elegance and romance of the story. I've seen the other movies over this summer and I find most of them good, but not as fascinating as this one. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has the characteristics of a painting. The colors and settings seem to be something you could find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric house. The costumes were beautiful and, although they were not the most comfortable clothes in the world, I found a scramble to create such a garment for myself. The whole movie was on the picturesque lake of Geneva (where one day I hope to watch because of the movie) and the tranquility that these historical figures have found there. <br /> <br /> This movie, besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of England's harsh judgments, shows the strangeness that also surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice at that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And taking laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was both medicinal and recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron had the pains of a foot foot. It was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were held during that summer. And they were poets at a time when experience was the key. There was no time for prudent caution. Passion and experience was a big part of the Romantic Age. And from the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy have created the legend: Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at that time) played by beautiful and talented Alice Krige. She is the controlling factor for everything that goes on until she also gives the experience. But she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms. Just like the power she inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. The music suits. The direction caught the essence of summer, as I read it. This movie is based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author takes the story of what she was able to compile from the real magazines of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants of this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even the small inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the Gothic, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the monster, which we still learn about the morals of "God playing." <br /> <br /> See a movie!
