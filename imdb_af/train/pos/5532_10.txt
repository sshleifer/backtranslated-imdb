Perhaps I'm biased for dragons, fox stories and everything, but I thought it was done wonderfully. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed showing it when Lily wasn't comfortable, like the fire and the room (don't try to spoil too much). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After making a few other comments, I'm a little confused, saying that the mother and her son appear at the end spoiler because she's the one telling her son her story. The movie I saw did not end the mother or son, just a painting of a girl with a fox. Can anyone relieve me of this? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, though some scenes may be a bit slow, which can be difficult for high energy kids to go through. Still worth it if they can sit still.
