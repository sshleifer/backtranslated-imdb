Pressburger and Powell's biggest movie. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death, but gets a second chance at life when heaven sees that he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The scene when the young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, come to heaven to be processed for eternal life, is unbearably gripping. Also look out for Roger Livesey, a deeply valued actor, and Kim Hunter as the love interest (later of course Zira in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg, the actress who played the main angel (Kathleen Byron), as the elderly wife of the parable private person in the saving of Private Ryan half a century later, an act that speaks volumes for his film literacy.
