One of the joys of picking up the recent Bela Lugosi collection is being entertaining movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi team up in a meteorite and radiation movie and while science is completely absurd (especially the camera technique Karloff, such as Janos Rukh, used to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and laughing do not care about the lease because the movie is enjoyable. The effects are well done for the time being, the acting is good and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the pulp-sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s, with jet guns and ridiculous science. You must see this movie!
