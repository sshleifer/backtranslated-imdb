An offensive operating time occurs to give the Cold Case unit information about the murder of a policeman committed years ago. The killing of Sean Cooper, a good policeman, has never been solved. Of course, the detectives believe that the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of James Bruno's baby. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension, as Sean, who is the godfather, comes upset and comes late for the ritual. Eileen Bruno doesn't seem to be happy there. The true secret is revealed by her. She caught Sean, who drank with Jimmy in the backyard, kissed her husband, and more shockingly, Jimmy willingly responded. <br /> <br /> Somehow at the station, partners become the center of gossip. Sean did not address him to his chief because he discovered involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business. Sean realizes this man is in with the drug-strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags Sean and Jimmy all the time in the station. The pressure is too much on Jimmy. Sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's own father wants nothing to do with a bad boy. Even his superior McCree wants him out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force. Sean is murdered because his homosexual condition and too much knowledge about his involvement in dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret. love with another fellow cop. We thought it was an honest account of a serious matter that no one spoke in those days. Sometimes the people involved in the show dare fear retaliation, or the networks, not to present these real-life situations. Jeannot Szwarc shows a sensitive approach to this arid issue, which is shown to another team without the sensational handling of the case. <br /> <br /> There is a rare Chad Everett appearance than parent Jimmy Bruno. She is right on the target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn't come out of hand. Shane Johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper. The film is wonderful and includes good performances by everyone under Mr Szwarc's direction. <br /> <br /> In this episode Nick Vera comes closer to his neighbor, the basketball player's mother, the detective has his ball away. Nick is looking for romance with the woman!
