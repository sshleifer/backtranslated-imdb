Several posters quoted that Renoir expressed his desire to make a film in which Ingrid Bergman smiled at the camera. The short answer is, should we not all, while the harsh reality is that only a few people have to do it. At this stage of her career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a photo in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within the year, after making it to Renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to start Anastasia. This is one of three films that Renoir has made in color at this time and on balance it is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult and even with French Can Can. Renoir probably figured out that with her as much as possible, Bergman could get away with a few wood leaders and Renoir picked up two boxes in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real-life incident in French history, but Renoir is happy to give it a once-over light and concentrate on replicating his father's paintings in intent after the essay. In his pastel colors, it looks like another movie of the period Les Grandes Manouvres that is not bad. All in all, it remains a pleasant little thing that depicts a beautiful and charismatic actress.
