I felt it was necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of the movie, as some of them were slightly misinformative. <br /> <br /> Originally I posted quotes from the original poster, but I wasn't sure if it was properly since it is the "comment" index and not a message board (although we used it so before IMDb the movie message boards added), I will edit it to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all you may not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly first known for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin panorama movie, he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the roles he played in most of his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal"). . Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to set up a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role of Broadway even though Warners MGM has more for the rights to play "Pal Joey." In my opinion, the WB film "Pal Joey" is a wreck, although Sinatra was fit for the role, but other problems sank the movie. (Written changes and bad direction. =================================================== ======== <br /> <br /> You are complaining that Kelly's photos are not well done, even if you quote your art education to prove the point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art is clearly designed to be bad, and it is needed for the story / characters, the photos are so bad, the audience knows Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even though he knows it, although Milo struggles to do so the point where he almost believes her, but it's important that the audience doesn't sit there and say, "He's a good artist, if he had the chance!" You want the audience to be fully aware Be aware of his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he sabotaged his interest in the show, and you don't understand the structure of The Story, refusing to feel like a gigolo, and knowing he is not really ready for the exhibition, his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not so good as Joey's enthusiasm for starting a nightclub. But it serves the same function in the plot. Remember, it is imperative in "Pal Joey" (the play) that Joey give his nightclub after he realizes he doesn't deserve. Same with the art show. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would undermine the whole point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I think it's in the eye of the observer. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but to me it was good. Compare it to even worse "forced" love stories such as the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> If you say that the big dance finals have nothing to do with anything else in this movie, just show that you haven't dug under the film's surface in his symbolism. Many elements in the dance series relate to the story and characters, and through the dance, the plot is solved by images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphony are built so that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationship. If you haven't seen it, it's not the movie's fault. This is definitely not a "cargo of crap". ==================================================
