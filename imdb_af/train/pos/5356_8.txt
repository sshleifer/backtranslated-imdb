Running Man is not a good movie, it's actually foolish. But it does what you want in an Arnie movie and it is action and entertainment. I don't see how anyone can't enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and, moreover, that it's almost fun. Incidentally, this is probably one of the most quirky Arnie movies out there.
