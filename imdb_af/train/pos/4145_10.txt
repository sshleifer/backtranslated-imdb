This is not Masterpiece Theater. You should not succeed in expecting it. It is pure girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads. As someone else said here, it was the movie Baby Mama that was meant to be. And the only downside I see for this movie is that Tina Fey wasn't in it. In addition, it is the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is pure folly on the surface, but if you really look, you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning for anyone who wants them to go back and do it all in life and then know what we know. . PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of escape.
