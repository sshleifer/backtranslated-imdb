At first looking at this movie, it's hard to know what happened, but at a later glance it becomes clearer. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand. In the first place she was caught up with Bob, but I really believe she landed to love him, even though she broke his heart. Dean Cain's performance was an ordinary excellent. He gets better with every movie he does. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was for the viewer to decide
