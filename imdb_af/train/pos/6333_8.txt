I just used this video and I watched it last night. The play started very badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister) but soon became very good after wards. The tornadoes look extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house split apart and the contents were blown in and thrown out, were very well done, and just as much as movies like Twister. The screens of destruction were also very well done. The story was very well written, and it is refreshing to see a movie like this from the same old "disaster formulas". Movies of this genre have been stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> While this movie had a very strange mix of FX and acting quality, it earned an A in my book.
