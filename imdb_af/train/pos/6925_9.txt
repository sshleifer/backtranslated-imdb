Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a gun, a Winchester in a shooting competition. Henry Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a bad loser and steals the gun. Lin takes his horse and goes to the Dutch and his men and the gun with his partner. High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The gun comes in different hands on the road. Will it return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and performed this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play. He was always the right man to do something. The awesome Shelley Winters play part of Lola Manners and she is wonderful as always. Dan Duryea is fantastic on the side of Waco Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller. Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are also seen in the movie, and they were played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and the young Anthony (Tony) Curtis play Doan. There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point, the group is surrounded by Indians, as it is western. It's great to watch this survival match where the fastest loading and sharpest shooter is the winner. All true Western fans will love this movie.
