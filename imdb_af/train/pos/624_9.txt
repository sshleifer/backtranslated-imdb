The summer was so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of movies, and not to mention the disappointments of those comebacks, I was wary of finding a movie I could just sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to read the page further (there is no spoil), I'll summarize it here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionable violent parts , very dead and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children, but don't try to be excessive or excessive. Think of it as a little more serious, a little more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm not as wonderfully a movie as others ... Maybe once or twice a month , if I feel active. I'm also a great Sci-Fi / Fantasy fan. I am bored of repeated recurring story lines and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is the rough diamond. <br /> <br /> At the end here (August), I was tired of broken expectations of the big hits I had averted to see Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. After I thoroughly surprised my expectations by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, Stardust's views were attractive, but I was probably careful. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was totally surprised. I thought to see another generic fantasy movie here for breakfast. Don't be deceived, it's definitely a fairy tale, and it does have witches, magic and absolutely unbelief. But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's NOT based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's really a great movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of the other movies that seem to be constantly appearing like thorns in one side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I can read a book this year, and in two years, the movie will be like another "epic fantasy story, such as LotR and the rest", so the NYT says and such and such no doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust didn't put me at my seat bumped due to jam-packed action at every turn, and I also did not ignite bullets because of a hook-and-loop to hook-up that dramatically split the dramatic tension and echoed throughout the theater into a hard tree. It didn't even use an enormous sound of sound to grab my attention on what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I look at you). It is not trying to show the latest CGI techniques, nor has my intelligence with dull dialogues and story lines that are simple enough, I found out in the 3rd grade. <br /> <br /> I just watched. Look and enjoy a refreshing CREATIVE storyline in front of my eyes. Certainly, I may have known what will happen in most of the movie, but it will let you forget about it. It even caused my heart in some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed was that I felt the theater better than when I entered. <br /> <br /> It's really a gem. After so many things this summer with so many remakes and movies that didn't meet my expectations, it was like a cold nice cup of tea trying to get all the hard work I put through the others to come out of them with Me money is worth it. <br /> <br /> It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy movies that are the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.), you really should see this movie. This little diamond finds its way into my DVD collection the moment it stores, you can trust me about this. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
