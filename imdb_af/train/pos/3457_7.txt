This is the Columbo that was spearheaded by Steven Spielberg at an early stage in his career. This is nothing sensational, but a few small tips for getting good things for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The movie is basically the same style as most Spierlberg's 70s movies and TV works. So that means some characters tend to show a little peculiarity and no, I'm not just talking about the Columbo character alone. The kind of character quorum that might be best seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie "Jaws". But unlike some small tips from typical early Spielberg elements, you can't call this movie the work of and fine example of a rising director. Not that it's bad, but of course it's not, but as I said earlier, it's not too sensational. <br /> <br /> This movie started out very well and very promising, but after it started well, in which As always the murder took place, the movie became more slow and dull. Deaf because it is mostly a Columbo movie by the book that does not have real memorable moments in it, not tired, because it is a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of a crime story writer who killed his writing mate showed great and interesting potential. However, the story did not explore all its possibilities. At least it's the feeling that this movie has left me. <br /> <br /> The movie was still a good one to see thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter than Columbo, due to his mystery / crime writing experience and trying to get him give all sorts of hints that lead away from himself. But of course Columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect, but he plays the game as usual. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good overall style and uses a fine camera position and editing. Funny to see that too, was mostly in line with Spielberg's later work, especially some of the camera angles. <br /> <br /> A good and perfectly viewable Columbo movie, but don't attach the name of Spielberg. to raise your expectations for it too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
