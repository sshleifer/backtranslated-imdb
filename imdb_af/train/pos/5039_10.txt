Stunning. Absolutely stunning. It's a movie about two kids whose father suddenly has a vision. He claims an angel visits him and tells him to kill "demons." He gets instructions later, and they start rounding off the demons, who are ordinary people for the naked eye. They kill these so-called demons with an ax on their heads and chop them up and bury them in the rose garden. Their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. The movie continues, with a twist to the end. <br /> <br /> The thing I like about this movie is that it perfectly captures the weakness of human perception. Are their dad totally angry? Or, does he tell the truth? The audience is left to decide. Go make the judgment for yourself and see the movie. Now.
