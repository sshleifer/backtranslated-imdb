Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. An excellent ensemble cast, strict editing and great direction. A hairdresser not caught in the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said about this movie without spoiling it. The tagline says it's all - 5 guys. 1 Safe. No brain. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell play a wonderful role. George Clooney has to be congratulated for producing this jewel. <br /> <br />
