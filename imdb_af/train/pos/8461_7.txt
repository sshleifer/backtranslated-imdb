As the title is in English and IMDb displays the primary language of this display as English, I will concentrate on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as presented in the Bandai released DVD set. My real review for the whole series is under IMDb's entry from Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W (1995). Very little has been changed in terms of plot, writing and characterization its adaptation to English and it Much depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this display. Purists can do everything to Japanese, but for a more realistic experience I have recommended the English example as all the characters, except Heero Yuy, are not Japanese. (Most of them are indeed Caucasian with a few non-Japanese Asians.) For one thing, the characters of the characters come more directly than in the Japanese version. The contrast between characters is stronger thanks to some <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam's pilot Heero Yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. Learn by Mark Hildreth whose Deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" but it fits very well with Heero's personality. <br /> <br /> The death of the Gundam's Duo Maxwell, once cheerful in the face of death, is given a course of training in nurturing the value of life and friends. He may be the best actor in the whole show, perhaps played by Scott McNeil. He may be a little too old for his age, but Duo's English voice is easily out of his annoying Japanese nose. <br /> <br /> Troya, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lost solitary soul that has the only purpose to date. was fought; In spite of his inner desire to make connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to befriend. Kirby Morrow gives a bleak but realistic performance as Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba Winner is spoken by Brad Swaile, who has no trouble wiping out the caring character of the character and breaking his innocence, as he experiences horror of war and death first-hand. A big plus is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes, it is pronounced by a female actress in the Japanese version), but a bona fide typical 15-year-old man. <br /> <br /> The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang, voiced by Ted Cole, may look a bit at the top, but it is in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, pronounced by Lisa Ann Bailey. It may not be placed with her youthful personification early in the series, but if her character falls into the story later, her voice follows and fits well with character development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise would be one of the more drastically altered voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect, in line with his high position status and charismatic nature. His English voice by Brian Drummond is more muted, which sounds more clear and "snake-like", emphasizing Zech's mysterious nature about his hidden agendas and strong beliefs in his ideas. <br /> <br /> The members of OZ are a mixed bag really. Treize Kushrenada expressed by David Kaye gets a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life Japanese style of speaking. However, Lady Une does not divide her split personality as contrasting as in the Japanese version, and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ......... bored most of the time. The cannon shed and military leaders are nothing to speak of. <br /> <br /> I'd appreciate if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. The voices of the Maganac Corp were generally not inspired, but could have been more interesting if they got Middle Eastern accents. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have sounded better with a classic European accent reflecting their status of nobility. <br /> <br /> In spite of the large-scale actions of the later characters, the main role can be the performance. in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic version of Gundam Wing's writing. Very true to the original Japanese writing, which contains all the underlying ideas that contain ideas and themes on politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also keeps the mistakes of the original Japanese writing.
