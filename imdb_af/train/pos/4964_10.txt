I really love this show! I've always liked Space Ghost's performances of the 1990s! This show was hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like that of the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who live his daily life with his mother and father and his best friend who wants to fall a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak got this really good singing voice and then she gave him no money Zorak made of singing. Another episode I like to find is the one where Brak and Zorak did not complete their homework and then they return from Sunday to Friday and they just go away and then return to the day when homework was invented and then When they return to the present homework did not exist! Another episode I like is the one where Brak's Dad and their neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, are still in this argument and then eaten by a huge worm. Another episode I liked was the one where Zorak was a bully and then a new man took over. I also like many other episodes! One thing that never makes me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, blown and seated!
