Sammi, Curr, a metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, try to censor his music !! (like real life Dee Snider, from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne). In a fire, Sammi Cure is supposed to dance to his old high school for a dance on Halloween. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan, is the only one who knew how Sammi was and what he felt. Nuke, the DJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons), gives the only copy of Sammi's last record Eddie. But if Eddie tries to play the record back, he finds Sammi dead with him and tells him what to do to get back at the bulls at his school that hate him and his music. Everything works out until Sammi starts killing !! A big movie and must be seen for heavy metal hair band fans, with a good soundtrack through Fastway, and only if you don't know what the songs sound or know, and they don't like it, they change a little vote and there is also a style like the famous Cinderella, or Ratt .. Is the movie a real horror movie? Well, it depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror movie is a shooter, with a lot of kills, or just as scary. This movie is also not dead enough, but it can't be called action, comedy, drama, tension or excitement, so that's why I'd guess it should be an abomination. So if you want Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' in the middle of the night, steal your soul! 'If you are Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat it is for you. I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
