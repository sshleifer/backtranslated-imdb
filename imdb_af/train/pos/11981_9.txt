"FULL HOUSE," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I've seen every episode yet, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) marry. If you want to know what made it so funny, you should have seen it yourself. It was a two-party, so you should have seen both. Another of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) are closed at Michelle's birthday at a petrol station. You should have seen it yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I have many others that I also want. Everyone has always produced a good performance, the productions design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. To conclude, although it can now be seen in syndication, I strongly advise you to catch it only if it goes out of the air.
