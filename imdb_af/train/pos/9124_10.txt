Have some of the dubious actors (there are musicians at the end of the day). This is in the words of Quentin Tarrinno: "The best rock movie ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, but without the rapping - a young musician, trying to prove him went to the local community while struggling to handle a broken home and a rival. Throw the gender stake and the truly exceptional performances, that's the right 8 miles. <br /> <br /> Prince offers a solid performance, such as Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Good script, good direction, good plot, and spectacular performances. Don't forget the best rock / pop / funk music you will ever hear.
