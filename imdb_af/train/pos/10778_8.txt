Now, this show looks like most other shows of the kind from the mid 90's, but the only thing about this one is that it is different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little drama too. I personally thought it was a good show, I can't understand why they would cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base of this show has been up to date since 1997. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the WB will bring the show back or even make a movie, which I know will be impossible to do, but hey, it doesn't hurt to dream or not? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would recommend if you didn't see the DVD from all 13 episodes, because the characters are good, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and good the whole show is not good.
