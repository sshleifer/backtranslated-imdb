Fever Pitch is a fun movie. It has many funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she breaks with my" things happens, but otherwise it still remains funny until the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot of fanaticism turns to the Red Sox, it doesn't get overloaded with sports. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy as well. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
