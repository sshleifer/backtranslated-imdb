There is something compelling and weird about this episode. From the beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet explodes within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy came down to evacuate the residents, all of whom apparently had already left parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian. <br /> <br /> The librarian's polite but cryptic advice on where all the citizens have gone to be interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members unexpectedly flung themselves in different centuries of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a period that seems like the 17th century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desert, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The divide between the two stories and the various dangerous situations in which the men find themselves are handled perfectly, with the return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes precipitate on the explosion of the planet . <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, touched by Mariette Hartley as a woman who has been ignored in the ice age, and Ian Wolfe as the city librarian. Something reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time series story is a rich and compelling series for the series, which later closed one episode. This should be one of the best of the whole range, especially remarkably seen overall lower quality of the third season overall.
