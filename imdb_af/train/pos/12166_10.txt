A very strange and compelling movie. It's about a very uncomfortable and tightly wounded man trying to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser / seller. The director was able to capture a very unpleasant tone that really served the story well. Original and disturbing as you also find lots of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a row at a test facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud, which I don't do as often as I have to do. One of the more memorable movies I've seen long ago. I didn't think and I'm looking forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic performances around the world. The simple line "I really appreciate it." is now iconic.
