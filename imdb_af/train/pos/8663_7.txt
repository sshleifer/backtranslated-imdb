"Rich in Love" is a cut-of-life movie that captures the viewer in the course of a somewhat impressive Charleston, SC family. Very romantic, beautifully shot, well written and performed, "RIL" rinses like a summer breeze over you as the inexorable meandering breathes into life in the characters, so you will feel like an old friend of the family at the end of the movie . <Br /> <br /> A wonderfully crafted character-driven movie by the driver of "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL" is a somewhat dark "sleeper" that will spark the most for adult audiences.
