I was incredibly impressed with this movie. It contains fundamental elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. It wasn't just about a genius musician who hit the bottom of the rock, but it was about a man trapped in grief, and trying drastically to find comfort in his music. He finds a companion who comes with her own problems. Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but more importantly a conclusion to events that formed their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character by contemporary rock star standards. Yet he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that made him stagnate, while things to him literally ruin. His focus is to create his Whale Music, and it actually becomes an obsession for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is the street-oriented child who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while in Des company. She also finds a common friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him over a period of time. <br /> <br /> These two love each other. Not the mind that blows, sex that is a kind of passion, but a love where friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who are hurt, they find confidence together.
