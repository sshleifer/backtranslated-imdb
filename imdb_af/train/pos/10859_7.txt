Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school movie of the same name, it is a stylized look at the triad bands of Hong Kong. Named election because a new leader or "chairman" is elected every two years by ancient traditions. Two candidates are on the point and by ego, bribes and past record, the race is stressing to say the least. Expertly designed to introduce you to a vast roll of rock without ever confusing, twisting and turning the story before revealing it in all its brutal glory. The Asian godfather, it's not, but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will drop you on the edge of your seat and falter in the violence. Subtitled volume 1 I think it's safe to say there will be other installments if we go deeper into the dark world of triads and all their feuding and private business deals. Anyway, it's a good start and if there are no prosecutions, it's a good movie.
