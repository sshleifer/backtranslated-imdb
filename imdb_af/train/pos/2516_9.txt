Based on the idea of ​​Gackt, Moon Child took place in a poverty-stricken country called Mallepa. In a futuristic timeline, the story follows the lives of the two main characters, Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their friends who grow up together. <br /> <br /> Despite some actions, it can be done excessively or may be humorous. I strongly believed it was a movie about friendship. Even under all the hardships between each character, in the end, everyone wanted someone on their side to have friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei portrayed a vampire who has the idea of ​​killing life. A Vampire found friendship in the hands of a young boy, who is not afraid of Kei. Regardless of what some thought, I see Kei as a paternal figure to Sho. Kei was there through Sho's earlier life, cared for him and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs could control their lives. On the other hand, Sho who may be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man, grew up to be a man who realized that life is not just about fun and games, that death exists and his loved ones can take away. <br /> <br /> I love the part where Lee Him, the actor who played Son, first appeared on the screen. The way they met was indeed pretty cool. Son also plays a big role in this movie. The fact that he is from another race, a Taiwanese, has made an impact on the friendship theme in the movie. The way friendships have been developed in spite of background differences, is excellently portrayed in this movie. <br /> <br /> I believed every actor did a good job, as it was their first time appearing in such a big screen movie. Both HYDE and Gackt managed to perform fairly well and created many credible characters. Unlike musicians who had musicians, actors became films and filled the movie with songs, they did great work! Moon Child has really made me impact, it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration, that we should appreciate every friendship in our lifetime. The movie shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things happening in their lives, that there is always hope. Life can be cruel, hope seems no longer. It also shows a very strong sense of friendship between each other, even when Son became the enemy, Sho had some kind of "fun" at their last battle. Each of them eventually won peace, no matter how far apart they became. The final scene showed it to us.
