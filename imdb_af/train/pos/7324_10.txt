My personal favorite horror movie. From the longest first tracing shot to the final story turn, it's a Carpenter masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween night 1963, Michael Meyers benefits his older sister. All-Saints eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael came home again to murder. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael steals and kills babies. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It is Carpenter's almost overwhelming atmosphere of anxiety that generates tension. Like any big horror movie, events are preceded long ago, but they still seem random and never let the audience get the chance to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark lighting, the long-lasting camera shots, and (mostly) that damn ominous music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I still have to see in film. There is a body number, but compared to the sled slashers hereafter it is quite small. This and most of the murders are almost bloodless. The fear is not in death, but not knowing. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. PJ Soles offers much of the movie's limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns into a decent performance and then there's the young (then) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance is initially ashamed and unsecured, but you soon realize that it's perfect for the character, who is ashamed of herself and is not ready for what she should see. And of course there is the perfect cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Resting in peace Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a bad mistake, it will be over time. Since the release of this film so many years ago, almost innumerable clones, copies, rip-offs and mimics have stolen and stolen (usually bad) the films' best bits until almost everything has become known. Combined with the changes for hearing expectations and appetite, one finds many of the films dilute power. To really appreciate this day and age, it should be seen as it ever was, as something unique. <br /> <br /> However, I have no discussion with recommending this movie to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards. <br /> <br /> 10/10
