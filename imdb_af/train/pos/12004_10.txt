This film is a real and historical film. This is very useful for those who are investigating the LDS church, as it is 100% true. It's an excellent movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It's very factual, exciting and motivating. There are some who think it is not factual, but it is. <br /> <br /> It is about restoring the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Day Saints, and about the Prophet, Joseph Smith, who restored it. It has such events in his life as the illness he had when he was a little boy, Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, birth, etc. Wash. But most importantly, it reveals the restoration of the church.
