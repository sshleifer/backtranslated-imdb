This show was a landmark in American comedy, as it was the first time to die for an entire African-American movie. Unfortunately, it was never broadcast on British TV. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. The father is called James, he tries to run the house, but his wife Florida always gets the better of him. The three children are the artistic JJ, the moody Thelma and the young intellectual child Michael. Always coming home, Florida's gossip friend Willona. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this show on YouTube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family - the only two on the site). You might think why an English viewer looked at a series that has never been shown in his country or barely heard. The answer is that. In 1976, Britains first came out of the black sitcom called "The Fosters". Only two series were made and it now seems forgotten. But I watched an episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts are identical to "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters but with different names. Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster and the three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's grim friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote a review about it). Looking at Good Times, only two things irritated me. First, the opening theme was (terrible) and secondly the audience was laughing. I like hearing loss, but in this person a slightly funny line will say and the audience will get angry and start slamming. In addition, it was a very funny show. Let's hope that more episodes appear on YouTube and hope someone will release "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Sex and the Evans Family - Series 1 Episode 6. The Foster's Episode of It's called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw was a black episode of one episode of "The Fosters"
