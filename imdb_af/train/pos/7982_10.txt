I am surprised that movies like this can still be made. I always look with my friends all kinds of movies and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. I never thought a 146-minute movie could make me think about it. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, an excited ex-terrorist agent after the bottle. Once dedicated to protecting the young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redeeming bow starts with the way only a beautiful little girl can provide. Pita is inevitably kidnapped by thugs and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City has to pay the price for risking his character's teddy bear coupling. Yes, he has become ... A man on fire. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie.
