Years ago I found a "bargain" copy of this movie for a buck or two. In so many ways, it's pretty appropriate, because when it was put back in 1933, it was really a cheap movie made by the "poverty drive" studio, Majestic. Although the movie is rather distracted, it's still worth watching and offers some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very well known, as in some Germanic cities people are upset because of some recent deaths that are apparently the work of vampires! At this fame is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - although he plays a much more innocent stranger. In this case, he is obsessive with his pet bats and people are beginning to be guilty of death. The film does a good job of giving some "red herring" (and it's not a genius to find out. Frye can't be responsible. The WHO and TRUE are intriguing and very different from The average horror movie In addition, while the production had little money to speak, it still had some good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and that also used the Universal Studios sets at night (then They were filmed for the day. As a result, the film looks good, although I also thought Fay Wray, as usual, was horrible - thought it didn't detract from the movie, I saw her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I noticed that her characters did not have depth, she always looks like the "screaming lady" and gives a little new to each movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, for fans of old horror movies, it is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre It's not, it's probably pretty overwhelming.
