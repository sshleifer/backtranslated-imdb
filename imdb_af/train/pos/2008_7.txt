The original Vampiere (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a successor would work as they didn't use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how it played. As a rule, prosecutions are never as good as the original, with some exceptions. Although this one was not a good movie, the author did well to keep the main themes and vampire lore of the first intact. Jon Bon Jovi was initially a drawback, but he proved that he was a halfway decent Slayer. I doubt anyone in the first could add James Wood's performance, though ... unless you bring in Buffy! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a decent look and I will see it again. <Br /> <br /> I left two questions, though ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a victim? Guess we'll just have to leave.
