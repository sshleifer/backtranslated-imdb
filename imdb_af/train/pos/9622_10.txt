I just watched this movie on Showtime. Totally by accident. If I had not just 6 hours of sleep in the last two days, I would not come home early. If I didn't get home early, I wouldn't have seen this movie. I wouldn't have known what I was missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This is the way this movie is. It almost plays on the Kevin Bacon effect. That and causality (hence my concern above). Any character is somehow interwoven. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is just wonderful. I'm going to have to get a copy to buy.
