"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical report, heroic story and insight into the cultural background of an important event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a tremendous job of portraying a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but he is delivering a message to the public about the horrors of South African Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his chief "influence", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to communicate the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot to his audience. It is because of big films like this one that the public can be educated on the terrible events in history, great leaders who have tried to end them and how we can never allow them in the future. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie to be seen by everyone.
