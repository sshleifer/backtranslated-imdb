In August 1980, the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the trial of her parents, Lindy and Michael, for the alleged murder of the child caused a riot over what was a very evil nation at the time. The media and the public have already tried and found the accused couple and have prayed for blood. What followed was a great miscarriage of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claim that while camping near Ayers Rock, Central Australia, a dingo took their ten-year-old daughter out of their tent while preparing for dinner in the braai area. No one believed them. Lindy was charged with killing her baby, and Michael as an accessory to the fact. The whole country was excited about the whisper of a ritual murder. The trial of the room hearing was over before it started. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, but the jury was pressured by public and media pressure. How can we, as a people, even sit in judgment? Where are we from, how can we possibly know? Unless there was absolute evidence, and no reasonable doubt, the Chamberlains had to be acquitted. <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi's film unequivocally and completely supported the argument of John Bryson's novel that the Camerarin was completely innocent of the charges laid against them. It actually had a dingo that took baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi got the brilliance of a thirsty nation. Hell was bent on the truth being revealed. He shows Australia in a little unknown light as a people who were completely obsessed with paying the Chambermates! His script, co-written with Robert Caswell, powerfully pushes the emotions and will certainly find the audience sad and angry in the transvestment of justice that has taken place. <br /> <br /> The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most terrible acts. She brings the toughest, small Aussie, the greatest conviction, ready to stand up for the allegations and straighten the world. Even her accent is almost, but not quite. A very good effort by the master of that trade. Sam Neill is just as good as Stripe as the initial loyal but then disillusioned with Michael who can't understand why their world is falling apart and he is beginning to question his Christianity. She, like Stripes, is an indication of great emotional power that will move you deeply. The whole support cast is also excellent, with some of Australia's leading actors and actresses playing a role. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also brilliant, with the director of photography, Ian Baker, with this splendor (especially the Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally loaded, while Bruce Smeaton gives a score. <br /> <br /> For all Aussies, it is a must, a shocking look in the mirror, if you like, with which We as a country have done to a family who just wanted justice to be served , and the truth must be known. As Michael Chamberlain said, "I don't think anyone really understands what innocence means to innocent people." <br /> <br /> Saturday May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even on return visits. Fred Schepisi's legal prosecution report that the Chambermates, who lost to Ayres rock as baby Azaria in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honest. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly conveyed John Bryson's novel on the screen, simply telling the terrible story of a vacation that was terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose newborn daughter Azaria as " a dingo was taken, just a moment after it was put down. <br /> <br /> In the midst of media speculation and vicious public rumors, Lindy was charged with killing her baby, and Michael was charged as an aid. What followed was little more than the media trial, and with the Australian people she found out she was thrown away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, although the prosecution was no motive and little different can not submit. br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is in the best shape as the accused woman attacking Australia's head to prove her innocence. She's really great, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does her best to sound like us. You may be wondering why a top Australian actress has not been cast, but strength is probably the answer. Along Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the man who sees his world falling apart in front of his eyes while feeling powerless to do so. A strong Aussie movie provides compelling support. <br /> <br /> Editing Jill Bilcock is very timely. Ian Baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged places is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Really a must for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
