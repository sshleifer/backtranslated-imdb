Initially, this movie looks so bad that I almost fell into a trance, the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic drill. But I gave it a second chance, then the one and the other, etc. I finally got addicted to this movie because of his dreamy slow pace, wonderful natural sets, bathed in soft autumn light and especially the musical score, made from about 70's progressive rock and absolute beautiful folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (the Troubadour). You should see the song about hazelwood, silver trout and lady disappearing in the air ..., hear in the middle and near the end of the movie. There are a few carnal scenes in the beginning that allow us to appreciate the natural charm of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film was made by some repertoire directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would have cast on the floor and touched the movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece. I personally think this movie is one million times better than any of Fellini's movie Sh # Â¤ @ t! Certainly not for the pretentious.
