David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, pretty good) is a lawyer, more skilled in dealing with corporate taxes (.. and suffering from unusual dreams that bother him to occupy this indigenous man in the dark), who is encouraged to matter about taking a group of indigenous people charged with killing one of their own Billy. We see that he is trying to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an indigenous tribe called Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "dead bone". to stop his heart. Meanwhile, David is turning around, bizarre weather patterns affecting Sydney, such as rain falling polluted dirt and rock-green hail into bright blue skies (without clouds, like the one hit a school in Central Australia), not to speak. , a "distorted" rainbow that is divided into groups (!). As David pursues the matter, he finds that he is much closer to the strange events he could ever realize. One indigenous name Chris (David Gulpilil) appears in a dream that contains a stone with blood and he thinks this man is one of those he has to represent at trial! He finds it quite possible, after some strange encounters with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he can be very well connected to a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are real pretenses of possible horrors that still come. <br /> <br /> Absorb apocalyptic drama build it is a story methodical and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir in charge, the film is arrested visually if we see these very overwhelming images of possible punishment against civilization. But the movie's most compelling angle is definitely David's journey to find that monumental truth bothering him because he has innocent Charlie and Chris's questions, first helping his men to go from a crime, and finally find out what he is dealing with anything that is catastrophic that occurs or may occur later.
