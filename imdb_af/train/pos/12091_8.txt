"Castle of Blood" is a well-crafted, surprisingly haunting entry by Italian director Anthony Dawson. Beautiful black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, wonderful casting, fairly logical essay, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though quite appropriate) make this one apart. Only the movies sometimes play music and the rare "first-sight love" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) is an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a bar and tells one of his ghostly stories to count Blackwood. Alan, a young news reporter, admits the great author, asking for an interview with Poe. In the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Incredibly, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Earl Blackwood offers Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night after Halloween when the dead walk. Alan can't afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10-pound bet. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Mario Bava's exaggerated "Black Sunday" ("The Mask of Satan"), "Castle of Blood" reasonably limited, the few moments of violence make even more frightening, especially surprising from a director who is usually associated with the terrible Italian spatial films of the 60s. It is unfortunate that the only version of this movie I found was poorly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Still, it is worth seeing and calling for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well to Robert Wise's "The Haunting".
