As a long Barbra fan, any posts will be biased. It's a classic movie. It has errors (highlighted in other posts), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70's) that will never be there again. It is fascinating to unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make this movie her own. I don't think she was ever happy. But it gives her fans a new Barbra (for the time) with LIVE singing, a young fresh look, and some very hard-working. <br /> <br /> The story is rough but exciting and keeps your interest throughout. The extended one frame "final" is difficult for most non-Barbra fans to go through, but it speaks volumes for those who admire her talent. <br /> <br />
