There are 21 comments as I add to this list and there is hardly any criticism. This is because this film is wonderful entertainment and a bit of everything in it. <br /> <br /> It may be a bit scary for younger kids, but my 15-year-old son thought it was fantastic in every way of action, humor and even the beautiful music party. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they are regularly watched and now that it is finally available in the UK, I will definitely add it to my collection.
