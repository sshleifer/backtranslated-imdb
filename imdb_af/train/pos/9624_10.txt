The movie I thought was excellent. It was supposed to be about romance, with some tension in between. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a great actor. I don't know why people still give him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris, she's a great actress and for those who think she's too old for Rob, it's only five years. <br /> <br /> Rob played a leading role in his own TV series, as well as one on the Scifi channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also died in a number of TV movies and is now making a TV Mini series. <br /> <br /> They should give him more leading roles to which he is best.
