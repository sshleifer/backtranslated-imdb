It's an excellent Swedish movie. It was the first Swedish movie I saw. It's simple and deep. What a great combination! Michael Nyqvist made a good performance as well. conductor seeking peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was wonderful as his inspiring friend to help him continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> The battle between the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael if his wife confronts him And defends Michael's noble cause to help his hometown people find their own peace in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was the end .. it wasn't that good, but it has some deep meaning.
