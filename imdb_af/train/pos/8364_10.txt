Robot Jox does not suffer from story or bad effects. I mean, it was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used the stop animation, as most of the movies were done throughout the 80s. Looking at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots available to them at that time. It wasn't until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized, and storyboards began to use that motive. But you'll have good memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very threatening. It doesn't mean you don't want to see the man without a very good backup plan. And there are a few good moments in this movie. A traitor / spy works in their midst. Whoever you think is on your side, who fully supports you, could be the person you didn't expect from him. And it's very hard to think like that, don't you agree?
