Green Eyes is a good movie. In the current context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film received the lack of respect soldiers to perform their duties during this period. From a historical perspective, the end of the Vietnam War left us all with something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this movie, and he earned the credits he received from writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown regularly or not at all. This movie is the kind of movie to be shown on TV every year, like the Wizard of Oz. The devotion of one man to his lost son moves completely. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
