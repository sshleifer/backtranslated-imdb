I am a Jane Eyre lover and a purist, and this version contains almost all the important details of the book, and the characters are portrayed as I have imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great wealth and cannot be delivered properly in a feature length format, so it needs a TV mini series. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best ever. There is a lot of conversation about how attractive he is and his age. In the book, Jane (the narrator) describes him as "about 35" and not young, but not yet middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he made it, so it's about right. Also, we just have Jane's opinion whether Rochester is beautiful. She just met him and he suddenly asked her what she thought. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can't imagine her having seen him attractive. The actor who plays Rochester, we must show the character of the man, and it is perfectly fulfilled. I love the relationship between the two clues, which is at the heart of this story, and the humor of their encounters. Other versions have blown it, but it gets it right. The 2006 version with Toby Stephens (37 years old) is on BBC1 and is very good, so I will decide if it's my favorite when it's finished. <br /> <br /> When reading this series again, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte's dialogue is preserved and it is essential for the power of the story. Modernization just doesn't work - it's a Victorian story and has an archaic poetic speech that suits the characters. This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is small and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has real presence and is a wonderful actor. There are no extra scenes to derive from the plot and the script contains all the essential scenes, but leaves out unnecessary details, makes it to the point and grabs. I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.
