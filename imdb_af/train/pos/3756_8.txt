Made just ten years after the actual events, and in the Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film is quite poignant. It is a series of sulfuric death awaiting the perpetrators of the world war. Not seen it for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting in their cave. Searing a little dialogue between two generals: "Does God exist?" "If He did, we wouldn't." Sorry this is no longer readily available for exhibition or purchase, as it would be interesting to see and compare this movie with the documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (also known as Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary) and " Downfall "with Bruno Ganz.
