Based on Elmore Leonard, it is a violent and intelligent action film. The story: A business man is being murdered by 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does good work as the main character and special credit, should go to John Glover who is kind of a naughty psychopath. I have to mention that the villains are very complex and interesting - something that is scarce for an action movie. also contains some beautiful and sexy women - most importantly Kelly Preston as the young asset to Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance to the hooker associated with the three extortionists. I'm happy to say that Ann-Margaret hasn't lost it yet - this woman is a real babe. Don't look at the tempo of this movie. I really don't know what the public and some critics against this movie have, but my suggestion is to ignore them and look at this truly gripping and subordinate movie. You'll enjoy it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
