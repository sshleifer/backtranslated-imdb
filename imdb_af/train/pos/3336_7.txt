I have to admit that I have gone into Fever Pitch with low expectations. It's not a big revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's latest movie Catwomanly was bad, and the Fever Pitch trailers were good, but didn't bother me. I've prepared a few cheesy baseball points for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was one in his film career. And now, we've got twice now! Another strike and it's back to SNL! "or" Buy yourself some peanuts and crabs, but don't buy tickets to Fever Pitch. You're going out of the theater and never going back! " Then the movie had to go and be more entertaining than I expected. But hey, I couldn't let my words go, right? Another reason I thought I would not give the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. The mere mention of Pedro Martinez's name makes me run to the bathroom. Oh man, keep on ... <br /> <br /> Well, I'm back. Anyway, my mother, who is a St Louis cardinal fan, still believes the World Series was set up last year. She refuses to believe that the Sox won it legitimately. But I'm man enough to admit that the Fever Pitch has made me experience it, albeit slightly, with the fate of Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sports will be able to switch film to a certain level. Unless you have a favorite sports team, you can't fully understand the extreme highlights and lows that a fan like Fallon's Ben can go through. There is nothing as fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing is as smooth as a clean slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It's the joy to be a sports fan. "Wait" until next year, "become your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and the Fever Pitch gets the essence effective. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real backdrop of the Red Sox's unlikely World Series last year. I'm not so fond of getting married, but you know what I mean. I expected it to be dealt with in a fairly cute way, and although some of the humor is a bit stupid, it's actually pretty realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died, he left his two season tickets. Ben didn't miss a game in 23 years. At the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends come together to find out who goes to which matches with him. He makes everyone dance for the Yankees games and when someone complains, he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and the Devil Slips. It's a very good scene, and it works so well, because I actually know people doing the "ticket concept day". I must also admit that I can talk when Ben is going to eat with Lindsey and her parents. The Red Sox plays a road game, but instead of watching it on TV, Ben decides to paste it. One of the most dangerous things in life is to tap a game and then be in public and try to prevent the result being heard. Was there. This is a very tense and scary situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a man appears at the restaurant and calls it to watch the game. Ben immediately covered his ears and started screaming like a banshee not to hear the rash. Lindsey is ashamed, and her parents don't know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be weird, I do not deny it. But it really is. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect the rough, edgy stuff known to the Farrelly brothers, you might be disappointed. They do have their moments, like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes speaks of her mouth, "like a beautiful victim," but overall it is definitely a softer, more romantic side to the brothers. lies. . <br /> <br /> Not to say the movie ever gets too juicy. Fortunately, when the juice starts to harvest a little, the Farrellys knows when to pull away. A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the veld and crossing over to Ben to declare her ominous love for him, really turns into Ben: "You must tell me abroad. Is it spongy?" Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm. Fever Pitch is just fine, solid entertainment that looks a bit fresh at the romantic comedy genre. It's a movie that guys and gals can both call. Especially the guys who practice sports fanatics at some point during the year and the ladies who have to deal with it. <br /> <br /> Now if the Red Sox fans could keep the "Bambino Bulls" it would be appreciated. My Memphis Tigers have never won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my lot bigger than yours. <br /> <br /> The GIS fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, the Red Sox, baseball or sports fanaticism in general should consider glancing at Fever Pitch. I won't get away to chase and see it at the first available time, but it will make a good matinee. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)
