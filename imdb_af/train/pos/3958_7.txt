Moe and Larry are newly married men, married to Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /> <br /> "Men's Beware" is a remake of 1947's "Brideless Groom," widely regarded by many as one of the best Stooge movies with Shemp. The remake contains most of the material from the film. The new scenes, shot May 17, 1955, include Moe and Larry's storyline with Shemp's sisters, cooking with turkey-cut turkey! A few new scenes are also tied to the end of the movie (a double for Dee Green has been used; if you shine, you'll miss the double look.) <br /> <br /> "Men Beware" would have made for a good movie with just the plot line to marry the sisters. Budget considerations, along with fewer bookings for two-line comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage. <br /> <br /> Although completely new films were still made by the Stooges, most of their editions were by 1955-56 made up of older movies with some new scenes being thrown in. "Men Beware," while one of these hybrids is viewable and entertaining; we get the most of the "bride-brown groom" again, and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the movie. This film is one of the latest Stooge comedies featuring new Shemp footage. It was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
