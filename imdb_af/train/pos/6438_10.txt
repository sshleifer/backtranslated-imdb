"So as in Heaven" .. as above below .. that very special point where Divine and Man meets. I present this movie! A gem. YES wonderful grace! <br /> <br /> I was so surprised by his very human quality. I laughed and cried through a whole register, indeed several octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT like Daniel, a first-class passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and exceptional talent shine at every stage, every interaction, in every meeting. I was completely hypnotized, captivated and caught the story, which is our collective story, the story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film was also included in many archetypes, messiah, wounded child, magical child, artist, teacher, priest, abuse, abuse, victim, bully, divine fool - ALL the characters so real and true to life - have all attracted great love and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> It is a great surprise to see such a thought-provoking, yet thoroughly enjoyable, movie. Oh, do not forget to forget the heavenly chorus of angels and breathtakingly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANK YOU GENERAL - This Swedish movie will surely captivate people worldwide. BRILLIANT!
