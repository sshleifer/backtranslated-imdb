Typically, "kids" movies have some annoying quality that makes it too juicy and unbearable for anyone over the age of 13. But then, before Holes hit the scene. Certainly, it has the same moments that often a children's movie gives the aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the awkward dynamics Stanley had at some of the other campers were more realistic than most movies were portraying. What I especially like about this movie was the fact that this movie didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most would think, like the Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, saving end). The only side? The hokey look lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.
