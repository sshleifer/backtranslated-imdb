I look at them all. <br /> <br /> It is no better than the amazing (_Strictly Ballroom_, _ Will we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it's totally respectful and pleasantly different in parts. <br /> <br /> I'm An English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather disturbing, for example: shouting, not looking, how does she move? Since when movie titles can ignore grammar? <br /> > There is nothing inherently wrong about Caribbean English grammar, not just Canadian standard English grammar, comment on the dialogue seems to me, I put the captions because I'm a Canadian standard English speaker, so I have just automatically assuming I was having trouble understanding it, it was not that difficult and it gave a distinct other flavor, as the other step movies I saw were so American. <br /> <br /> I loved that this movie was set up in Toronto and actually wished it was even more clearly there Beloved that the heroine was cast atypically. I enjoyed the stepping routines. I like the driven Mum character. I felt that many of the issues in the movie were more subtly addressed than that of dance movies. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then it's a decent one. If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard that you have grown up, your mind now can be difficult to enjoy this movie.
