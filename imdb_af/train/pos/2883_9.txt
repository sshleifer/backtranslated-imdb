"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father is married again. After her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very common to her and she did all the tasks in the house, such as cleaning up her two evil step soldiers. One day, the king sent a message to all single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to get a wife. Of course Cinderella didn't go, but her step sister did it. Cinderella was very upset and thought there was no way to attend the Royal Ball until her fairy tale grandmother appeared. So she did a little magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back midnight, because that is when the magic turns back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella lost time and the bell struck midnight, so she walked out of the palace and lost her glass curtain. Then the king orders the duke to find the women who wear the slipper. The duke searched every home, but eventually the women to whom it belonged, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> In 1950, Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney movies. This movie is about a magical fairy tale. In the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a servant to her own family and no one loves her, but with a little magic her whole life changed and eventually found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy-tale grandmother showed her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing my home, so I will never forget it. I also had the part when Cinderella and the Prince sang the song. So This is Love while dancing because they realize they are in love. Overall, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a little kid because every little girl wants a fairy tale life.
