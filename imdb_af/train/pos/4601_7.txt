Police Story is an incredible set of pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery. Some of the stunts here are under Jackie's best and most dangerous. The whole mall-fighting final is probably Jackie's biggest single-shot, more brutal and less comical, then Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the battle, you can almost feel the pain of the impact. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not hold this quality, as it is a fairly formal cop thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in movies like Project A where its natural comic talents shine. In the serious limits of some elements of the police story, it just doesn't work for me. To say this, though, it's still there with Jackie's best films due to the incredible stuntwork and sheer spectacle. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies, the English DVD version avoids, as it really sticks to the captions. <br /> <br /> Big stunts, OK movie is a good starting point if you haven't seen a JC movie yet and are worth a watch for any movie fan. 7/10
