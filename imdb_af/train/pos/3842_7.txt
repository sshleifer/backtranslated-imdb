A sometimes surreal thriller that will push the buttons of most people. The 4 Man is sure that someone with a taste breaks out for the politically correct. The story's main character is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously distorted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything that is wrong with the modern man. He is ruthless, deceptive, unable to control his urgency, afraid of committing to <br /> <br /> meaningful relationships, and totally apathetic about life in general. As the character himself points out at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders who consume Christ and wake up the long march to his own destruction. He chases <br /> <br /> one man (presumably a boyfriend), chasing another at a train station. Later, during a lecture, he meets a woman who wants to help him, or <br /> <br /> maybe she has more shameful plans. She quickly took Gerard into her web and attracted him with sex and money, much of both. She also has <br /> <br /> secrets, like three dead men. Is she lonely and really looking for someone to cherish - or is she a deadly black widow who insults Gerard until his death <br /> <br />? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does his best to guess what she is going to do. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting movie, with lots of sex and intrigue. It's similar to Verhoeven's <em> Basic instinct </em> but has much more depth and is definitely more shocking. There is a lot of very strong gay content that some viewers can close. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent <br /> <br /> psychic vibrators, or anyone looking for something completely new.
