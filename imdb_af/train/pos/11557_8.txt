Nice loud, sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys - Lemmon, a neurotic clean "housekeeper" and Matthau, a Slob sports writer - who decide to live together to reduce spending. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed and targeted. The writing is a lot of barbed wire - that is, there is always more than one side to almost every line. Specific funny scene involves 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who are almost surprised by everything someone says, but when Lemmon breaks his photos of children and, yes, ex-wife-to-be, he has the girls with sleeping him Matthau can come up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
