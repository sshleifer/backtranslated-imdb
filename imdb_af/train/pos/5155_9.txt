"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was shrouded in controversy before it ever broadcast, and that controversy can obscure the fulfillment of the movie. <br /> <br /> Those who criticize the movie, who did not see them with good intentions, based on the wrong idea that it would be too sympathetic for Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: to encourage the evil, Hitler is not sympathetic to him. It is much more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest villains of history have been committed by man. A sick, sick mania, surely, but man. It is necessary to know the story of how Hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" is highlighted by a brilliant, career-best performance by Robert Carlyle, who makes Hitler one without ever delivering him. Carlyle underestimates the appearance and manners of the Nazi leader without making the personification mockery or leaving us (something Anthony Hopkins could not have achieved properly when he portrayed Hitler in The Bunker, another very good television made movie) ). As they were dismissed by Hitler's depravity and virulent ant-Semitism, Carlyle gave him a certain magnetism and power to possess the right Adolf Hitler. For otherwise would a nation have followed him? <br /> <br /> Of the various subplots, by far the most compelling features of Matthew Modine as reporter Fritz Gehrlich, make it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. Although Modine's performance is a bit in Part 1, Part 2 is establishing itself. The character gives us a real hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also provide strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part mini-series suffered a bit of excessive brackets, including a look at Hitler's childhood which only lasts for the duration of the opening. And in Part 2, sections of Hitler's relationship with his cousin, and his mistress Eva Braun, are less successful than the central plot, but serve us a further insight into his spiritual and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Eventually no movie about Hitler can make us understand. The average person is unfortunately unable to ever understand a man who would try to wipe out a whole race of people. "Hitler: the rise of evil" tries less to understand Hitler, and more to let us understand how he has become. This is an important story to be told, and it is impossible to believe that anyone who saw the film accused him of having nothing but the best intentions and the ability to do nothing but good no. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
