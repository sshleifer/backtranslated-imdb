The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dancing. As I grew older, I became more interested in acting. While the first half was just a retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still entertaining to watch. The "Badder" series could have been, but the kids were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially when the police officer told Michael: "I need your signature here" after letting him dance in a no-dancing environment. But it's "Smooth Criminal", it's the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). The dance is perfect, and so are the special effects. The only thing I could have done was the spiders. Any fan of Michael's should see it if you haven't. I give it a 10+!
