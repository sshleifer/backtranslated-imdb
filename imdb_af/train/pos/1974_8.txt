I think the reason for all the opinion on diarrhea on this movie is that most people make it up because Sharon Stone is about 50 and gets naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the golden girls were eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but seeing someone on the menopause to be digitally happy while driving is just too much for some to handle. Let's see it, she looks good, she is lighter years hotter than my mother who is the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but since the turn of the century it's all filmmakers expect: a cinematic experience that touches your soul. As such, it does not claim. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and exciting, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. This is the character of Catherine Trammell who helped to give way to this successor. Fans of the first movie want to see more of the icy ice queen. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and art direction was lazy and outrageous and surely made me move to Britain. The score is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> Sure, there are some characters from some characters, but there are some brilliant works by David Morrissey that are virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> There is a setback in the fact that the script is virtually the same as the first movie that just plug a psychiatrist in place of the police. As well as the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to cut even more, taking away the guilty pleasure that the story is known to. <br /> <br /> At least it is entertaining and entertaining. fun to watch, and that's the only intent of the movie. So if you have a beef with Mizz Stone, should you actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before spitting your projectile vomit?
