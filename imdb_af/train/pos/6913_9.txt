As a community theater actor who works hard but does not act too seriously, I am always amused by those who treat it as Great Art. This film ruthlessly dispels the "Actor's Craft" while leaving very good laughs. <br /> <br /> A Ham actor in place for a movie has a deal with the dictator. When the dictator of a heart attack dies of too much alcohol and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the neo-Nazi head of the secret service for a lifetime. He plays it at stake, gets the dictator's girlfriend in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables on his prisoners nicely. <br /> <br /> Many good chicks lead, very good work by some unfamiliar supporting actors, especially the housekeepers and two members of the palace guard, and plenty of fun comos. Sammy Davis Jr. highlight himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and especially Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, but it has many beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous screenplay and good actors who do their thing and seem to have fun and not the usual existential fear is about what is just play-active!
