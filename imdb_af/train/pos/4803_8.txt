It is difficult to find a straight, bad historical drama based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Just a respected British or Australian actor, make things look good, and you are guaranteed a formula for Oscar success. <br /> <br /> The Young Victoria is no exception, just about everything right, the movie and beautiful, with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. With the movie of Emily Blunt in a role she can finally enter, the movie starts with Victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the plot and issues surrounding her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) . As the young Victoria laments herself, she moves like a chess bean through a variety of parties, as she finds her foot and voice as one of Britain's most influential rulers. <br /> <br /> As it moves around the chessboard, it's pretty typical territory, it's the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert that makes the movie a little more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I'm linked to these figures a little. Despite their many deficiencies as rulers, Victoria and Albert of the first leaders were devoted to improving civilization for their people. They left their legacy in the arts, in public health and education, and in Victoria's conservative view and mourning culture after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> It is fairly well established that Victoria and Albert were not only fond of love, but also had some respect for each other which is not usually seen in monarchs. in regular marriages. Even if they were behind the scenes, they were definitely one of the best known. Blunt and Friend have just the right kind of chemistry to do the well-known few justice, the right mix of restraint and despair. It's another love, not usually on the screen, especially in this kind of movie. It is encouraging to finally see a relationship in which husband and wife are on a level playing field. <br /> <br /> But we don't get that love enough. While the filmmakers are trying to adjust the relationship between the political bumps, it does not build the kind of momentum needed to keep the tension high. Also, without sharing in the more advanced key public work of the couple, things feel slightly limbo, superficial rather than intimate, and sometimes confusing. It's not that big a problem during the film, but afterwards the effects are turned off quite quickly and you find yourself remembering what you just watched, despite the perfect representations by the leading, most remarkable Blunt who even capture the well-known monarch's expressions. <br /> <br /> As much as it tries, Victoria succeeds on many levels, but lacks some sparkle that will take it from solid to classic.
