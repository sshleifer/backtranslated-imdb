Never seen this movie and considered it a good Classic with great veteran actors. In the time when this film was made, people in the United States were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today, except the Radio and the start of big films made in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories of young romance between a young girl or man were seen differently than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet," 44 played a young orphan called Carrot Top because of her red hair and looked at herself in a house of two elderly people, who were like two owls, and watched Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone. And if something happened, the whole town found out within minutes. It's a film on earth with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very simple way of life. Today, it looks like ballast and stupid, but believe me, it was the way people were in America in the 1920s. & 30's and they were a good generation who loved good family movies.
