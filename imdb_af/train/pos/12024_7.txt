The good thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you don't have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback. It would have been nice to include some of the original characters in the new story and see how their lives evolved. Sinclair as in the original is excellent and offers the films the best comics while attempting to handle uncomfortable and embarrassing, but the supporting role is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth is congratulated with a brave attempt to move the character and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawed and has the warmth of the original
