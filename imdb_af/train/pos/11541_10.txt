Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this one - everyone else in the movie is also fantastic. The Dialogue is excellent and very, very witty - and the scene where Lemmon's character tries to wipe out his sinuses in a restaurant leaves me laughing every time I see it. Anyone who has not seen the unlucky successor should not be turned away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone. I love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character straight ahead with tragic overtones adds me to the hilariousness. These two big guys together made a string of movies, but this one is the best - no doubt.
