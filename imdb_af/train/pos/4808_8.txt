THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegant costume and reproduced piece of history that benefits from a few fine settings, solid direction by Jean-Marc Vallee of the stale black Julian Fellowes's version of the youthful lass that England's longest royal queen has become. Much of the early part of the movie, that part when Victoria is a child, whose rise to the throne is being defeated by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), seems to be dragging and getting lost in the multiple costumes and scenery. variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is harassed by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). Blunt is a strong actress and finds the delicate line between girlish imagination and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those in the court who want to control the 'children's queen' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures in her role as queen, her eye on the exquisite German Prince Albert and a love affair that lasted in the memories of all, is adapted by the concept of joining Royalt with concern for her care subjects. to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of their first nine children and then ends with a few statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the different royalties across Europe! It makes an evening of beautiful costume drama and enables us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if not transported epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
