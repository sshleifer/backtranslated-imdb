Bunny Comes Home 'This Man's Fleet' earns more credit than it gets, a clever writing by Borden Chase, led by 'Wild Bill' Wellman, the movie has just the right feel for early post WW11 euphoria and benevolence, and not one of the blind terror who came into the game a few years later. Made in 1944, defeating the Japanese, the scene of a little déjà vu, Tom Drake's melancholy appeal to radiant young Jan Clayton has solid chemistry, really plays and validates Drake's Metro career. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel'. Wally Beery, a little bleaching eye, boasts an always awesome Jimmy Gleason? his memories an improvement on reality, giving Beery a Ulysses-like shadow to play against. The vessels LTA (lighter than air) are authentic, photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is from March AFB. Lot 3 doubles for India, and Bunny's U-turn ?? Bunny Comes Home ?? gave Beery a true piece of his past, something he wanted to believe was true? Then the future we turn into again is fantastic? now on a larger scale, a new design Navy LTA with launching capabilities for a reconnaissance aircraft ?? how expensive, happy optimistic ?? Still, "You must believe in it, that's how you make things?"
