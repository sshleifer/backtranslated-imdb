I saw this film in a London cinema in 1975 and didn't see it. I found it hilarious. I loved its originality. It's hardly for anyone to make such a movie - and it's also sad. <br /> <br /> What I mean, once I read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a movie fan, I always have "photo" books as movies. do you know? But as I read it, I thought, well, that would make a good movie - but it should of course be adjusted - to the point where it would have little relationship with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well WHY? Certainly, it can never be shown on Sunday afternoon TV, but provided it is shown to adults in the theater, who knew what it contained, where is the HARM? Dammit, My civil liberties have been broken here. A director should be able to make a literal movie adaptation of "The Black Hotel." <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, censorship of adult movies should not exist. Unfortunately, while accepting this with INTELLIGENT adults, such freedom can be harmless, and there will always be those who lack the rationality to distinguish between phantom and reality, and who may be encouraged to commit unfair acts. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into that category. <br /> <br /> The British censorship has dispelled its appearance in England. In spite of the '69 recreation on nudity, given the film's theoretical theme of bestiality, if the censorship had any success, he would look for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days there was an alternative. The G.L.C. It was a local city council with a department that had the power to pass a movie just for London, where audiences were thought to be more sophisticated than those who lived in the vines. <br /> <br /> The movie was filed and passed. However, it later found out that the "council" only consisted of four people - three who voted, plus a "chairman". And that day one of the voters was sick. So the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to see "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of the elected voters thought, like me, that the movie was hilarious and probably encouraging unfair acts by anyone. The other did not have imagination and simply thought the piece was disgusting. And the chairman didn't understand it, so decided to miss the side of freedom. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also considered it disgusting, but it was late! The film received its "X-London" certificate and opened for mixed response. The G.L.C. movie censorship board is disbanded shortly thereafter! So "La Bete" only opened in London by what could best be called a FLUKE! But I'm glad it was. It's great! If you haven't seen it, do it. It's a FAN, and as such it is much less disturbing than most things you see on the news today ...
