In this first episode of friends we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discover that Rachel, a rich girl who is Monica's girlfriend of high school, left her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar because she discovered she didn't love him. She also decides to stay with Monica and become independent of her father, to get a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, has discovered his wife is a lesbian and loses her to Susan, her partner. (We'll see him in the episode after a new apartment) <br /> <br /> In this episode, Monica (and ultimately sleeps) with Paul "the wine man", who gave her the excuse to impotent be. since he divorced his wife. But in fact, he just misled her. <br /> <br /> PS: I just laughed at Joey's and Chandler's hairstyles in this first season! =)
