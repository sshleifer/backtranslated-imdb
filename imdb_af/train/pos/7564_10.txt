In my line of work, I am sometimes contacted by independent filmmakers wishing to publish their movie. If I can, I look at these low-budget movies and often let me think that the future of Hollywood goes to the dogs. However, there is once a film born of pure passion and desire, as if it were created to remind the film industry that good movies are still possible. The short film BROKEN, director of Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and is worth a second look. <br /> <br /> In a rare 20 minutes, BROKEN beat a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no story. The audience is dropped in the middle of the action without knowing what is happening. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from a dream to hear a shoot and is then kidnapped from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenaries who look like a comic book at home. These nasty guys and girls are bigger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The kicker here is that, despite being a low budget movie, it doesn't play like one. From the beginning, the feeling that B R O K E N was shot, edited and produced by professionals. It seems like something that Quentin Tarantino might have done on his day when he was trapped with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big. <br /> <br /> The acting is much better than I usually see in these smaller movies. Polay and Paul Gordon (who play the killer, Duncan) are well chosen. If two of the few talking rolls in the movie, it is up to them to wear the movie. No special effects, no matter how good, would have saved this movie from bad acting. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey true fear and Gordon manages to come down as a real psycho. Some of the more limited roles seem to be filled with less talent, but it barely shows. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of B R O K E N is that it is only 20 minutes long. The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that looks a bit confronted and is barely subtle. If I see it, I felt like I had some epiphany, but there was just a feeling that it was much more commonplace than I had hoped. The film is trying hard to be one of the puzzles, making audiences speak at the local coffee shop, but it comes out unsatisfactorily. I think it's the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. <br /> <br /> MY RATING: 8 out of 10.
