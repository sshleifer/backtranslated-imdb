The snobs and pseudo-experts consider it "far from De Sica's best". Those suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem related to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italian does not have the intricate self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers, or the bitter self-parade of Pietro Germi, the sharp bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli, the ceremony of Visconti or the cold perception of Antonioni. De Sica told us the stories like a dad sitting on the edge of his children's bed before going to bed. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what we call magical realism today. The movie is a jewel from start to finish and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but of course it requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Magnificent.
