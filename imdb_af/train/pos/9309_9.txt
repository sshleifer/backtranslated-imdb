dear god where do i start is not the best movie i've ever seen. The camera angles are great, but I think the play was the best. why the writing writers for this movie don't write big budget movies, I will never understand. another is the cast. it is wonderful. this is the best ted-raimi movie out there. I know some of you there are probably thinking "no way he has much better" but not you wrong. raptor island is a work of art. I hope it should have been the best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors. I believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever.
