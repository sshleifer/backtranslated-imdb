It's an interesting series that takes real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes a part of their true story with a continuous series of characters taking part in the story. Railroad Detective "Matt Clark" - takes a role in finding famous outlaws from the Old West in stories that are at least partially based on real accounts. In this sense, it is almost an anthology series, and as someone else has noticed, this strange structure is a timeline in conflict with the real events, but it is a fun series with lots of action to get a western hungry 1950s audience Satisfied - and it retains 55 years later pretty well. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear, as he goes against some of the worst bad things in history. And his girlfriend sidekick Frankie is quite a dish. If you are a western fan, make sure you have a chance.
