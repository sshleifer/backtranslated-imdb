What I expected: Excessive stereotypical portrayal of a sportsman and an equally lame stereotypical depiction of the bile that likes him, while suffering from a second banana for his overly keen support for his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: An even-handed story where both gall and bail finally acknowledge - for themselves and each other - that they each have passions in their lives, but each can forgive the other for the love they share, save. . <br /> <br /> Sounds juicy, but with the nonstop humor and fantastic performances this story works! Barrymore is a classic Barrymore: the perfect blend of sweet, strong and rich. We expect it from her and her. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the nice surprise in this movie. He brings the perfect blend of sports note with the appreciation of the normal things in life, such as caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can care ("You just ran out of the field for me!") And in the same breath is blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel, Kinda spongy?"). Fallon's portrayal "made the film". Hopefully, this movie shows the start of a better movie career for Fallon, something beyond the exaggerated sophomoric humor typical of SNL alumni (ie Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a movie that has been the victim of stereotypical male versus female characters that has come above the limit and has delivered ceaseless cartoons to humorous lines. Most were rendered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, I've seen it with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved it as much as I did. It's not a "Guy Flick" or a "Chick Flick". This is a great make-you-laugh flick. Go see it!
