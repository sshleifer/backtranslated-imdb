I waited a few years before this movie was finally released in England, but in many ways was very happy when I finally saw it. There are many good things for the movie, for the start of the play. It's not something I need so much in a horror picture, but the people in this movie are doing everything in good work. This and the constantly gripping and interesting writing, with a good kind of Lovecraftian, feel it, giving the film a true solid backbone. Add to that the doses of surreal nightmare image and occasional gruesome gore and the movies a winner. It also has my favorite kind of gore, supernatural and splashing. Also the characters of Marcus, the fierce bodybuilding transsexuals and Daisy, his mentally handicapped lover / playtime are actually freakish and unnerving at times, and far out, anything goes well with grown-up maturity that works well with regular Freudian overtones. This is one of the most impressive recent horror movies, much more shocking or out there than Hollywood can produce. My only problem was that I wanted the end to get darker, but it still works, so I really recommend it to serious horror buffs.
