I watched this movie (the English title is "Who's Singing There?") At the 1980 International Film Festival in Montreal. It then won raves ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. This is brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and very funny. The writing is a work of art. It is 19 years old and I only saw a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for the case) that matched its originality.
