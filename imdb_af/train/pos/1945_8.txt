This latest Voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. Voyager made it back home. In the many years it took to return, the Vulcan Tuvoks's mind was destroyed. He had a disease that was too late to heal. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway is about aliens who have time travel technology. She realizes that there is a Warp channel in the Delta quadrant that Voyager can bring home immediately - if she can retire in time and notify Voyager. There is a problem. The canal is deep in Borgruimte. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. He is like a child. He scribbles tho, obsessed, works on math problems or movie reviews or something, he is convinced is important somehow. In the institution, Tuvok cries and asks Janeway to please come. Come back to him. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to recommend a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years before the Sponsor, hoping to return in time and using this new technology to Voyager lead to the Warp guidance. <br /> <br /> When she goes back in time and joins Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree and argue about the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok and asks him if it is true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits it is true, but it cannot be cured by the facilities on the ship, so he has kept it for himself. <br /> <br /> The young Captain agrees with the old Captain's plan. To increase their chances of success, the older Janeway plans to lead the Borg with her vessel. The guarantor caught Janeway and her shuttle. The Sponsor Queen personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected it! the Borg Queen stole a virus in herself that kills her. With the Sponsor Queen, Voyager is back to federation space through the Warp channel.
