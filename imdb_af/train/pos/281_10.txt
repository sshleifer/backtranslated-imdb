This game was very good and quite a challenge. It has a great, ghostly story line and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all Horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I wanted more weapons, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />>
