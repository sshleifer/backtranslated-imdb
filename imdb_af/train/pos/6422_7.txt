Military training films become so common that they become a genre for themselves. Among the more prominent are our 'Officer and a Lord', 'Top Gun', 'GI Jane' and now 'Men of Honor'. The fact that this one has become true does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This movie is probably the most like "GI Jane" as it focuses on the desegregation angle. <br /> <br /> The story is actually pretty inspiring and is probably the best human interest story among the above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines brightly in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has tunnel vision in the presentation of characters and evades the character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of Brashear in a constant state of adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and apart from the initial scene, the fist fight and a few scenes with his wife, we don't know much about him. For example, Brashear sees the scars on Sunday's palms and we assume he has worked a plow, but there is no follow-up at that point. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) only gets one short scene through which we can judge him. The rest of his screen time shows that he is moving around and ranting. If a director is going to make a human interest story, he has to renew the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr gives excellent performance as Brashear. It's probably the best I saw him. It is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he previously played, and he rises to the occasion. In 'Jerry Maguire', Rod Tidwell was a fascinating but one-dimensional character with the depth of a rain pool. Brashear is much more complex and well-founded, and the problems he faces are life crises, which make the part much more challenging. This is an excellent recovery from Gooding's last role in "Chill Factor", a film so terrible that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take part. <br /> <br /> After an attempt to try his hand as a comedian ("Analyze this", "The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle", "Meet the Parents"), Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic Roots with excellent performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he's just such a big dramatic actor that he doesn't have to waste his comedy. DeNiro gives Billy Sunday a rock-hard personality based on a tortured soul. It's a pleasure to see him work. <br /> <br /> It looks like every movie I've watched lately has Charlize Theron in it. I saw "The Legend of Bagger Vance", "Men of Honor" and "The Yards" in a row and I started wondering if she had a role in every film in 2000 (actually she only has five done). It was a small role for Theron, but she did well and managed to stay with DeNiro step by step. David Keith, who dies with Richard Gere in 'Officer and a Gentleman', has a camel here. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting special features, including reflections by real Carl Brashear and some removed scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie despite the hacked plot and the one-dimensional presentation. I evaluated it a 7/10. I am a sucker for underdog stories and I love stories where character is the central theme. This film is exceptionally strong in both areas and brings us two memorable performances that compensate for some of the directors' shortcomings.
