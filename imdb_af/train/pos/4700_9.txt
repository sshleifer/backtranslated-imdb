I couldn't believe the low 5.6 rating on IMDb about Johnny Dangerous, at the time I wrote this review and I thought I should do something to promote the memorable piece of comedy as much as possible. Seriously, to get a score so low, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very shallow open mind. If you don't like humorous flicks, don't look at them! The combination of absurd humor, a very good storytelling and an excellent pace given by the multiple running gags made this role in my DVD collection. And that's without including the visual dangers here and there and of course the use of "clin d'oeils" and "cliches" based on our favorite organized crime movies. <br /> <br /> I introduced this movie to many people and introduced it without any specific expectations (except perhaps a comedy). You should consider the mind at any movie in my opinion. - They all liked it very much. It's okay, it's not long to look and there's absolutely no slowdown in the evolution of the story, which I think is really straightforward. Certainly it's not perfect, some gags fall a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially if you consider other views. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This movie is, in my opinion, a forerunner such as "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well thought out comedies. What is more and more absurd nowadays, while cutting off on the mind and grace. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people think to be understood correctly, if at all. As a final word, I'd like to say: look for yourself, don't follow the average Joe's verdict and if you don't like it, you'll know it's not good for your taste, it's understandable but unlikely in me opinion.
