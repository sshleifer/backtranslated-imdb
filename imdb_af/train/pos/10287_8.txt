This is one of those movies that they have promoted too much. If you look at T.V, you can't see the movie either. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one that just happens to be the funny thing about Jennifer Annisten. It's typical Jim Carrey's humor and it's really funny. Just don't see this movie expecting to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies, it's a must-see, otherwise you just see the previews and you'll be just as happy.
