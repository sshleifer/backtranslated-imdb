I like Top Gun. It kept my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and story line. It looks very much like High Noon in that the villagers look weak and afraid to stand up for a villain. This movie has some quality actors who really didn't get the chance to share all their talents. Also, some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a good man in his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor is outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best with poor materials. It's hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a given character. She barked that two men could fight over her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
