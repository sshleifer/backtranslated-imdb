Sitting, Tap? Nothing is the latest "what if?" festival hosted by Vincenzio Natali, with David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One has relationship problems, canned his work (due to relationship problems) and the police are getting him (due to his work and his relationship problems). The other man is an agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home, is met by a difficult girl guide who calls her mother to claim she has been molested when he does not buy cookies from him. Oh yes, the police are also after him, after the girl's scout girl calls them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> What if you can make it all disappear? This is the whole premise behind 'Nothing'. The two fools realize, the policemen, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything? disappeared. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also watched the time of this, 30 minutes in the movie, and I left in the movie for another hour. Can the 2 actors make this work and entertain us for 60 minutes? Although the actors are trying, 60 minutes is a long time and there is clear dead air in places of this movie. But the two actors, who are lifetime friends with each other and the director, have such a great repertoire with each other, that it was nice to watch for the dialogue and to improve the two dead. There are many supernatural elements, but these are more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this movie worth seeing.
