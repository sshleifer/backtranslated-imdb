Mary Pickford ("Born on the Fourth of July" as Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (of French heritage); She fell in love with Jack Holt (like Karl Von Austreim), who moved to America with his German father and American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (like Count Jules de Destin of the "Fighting Destins") fell in love with me. Pickford. The love triangular trio eventually arrives in France, with the Great War (World War I following) complicating their lives significantly. <br /> <br /> A most entertaining, propagandist defective, Cecil B. DeMille movie. The torpedoing and sinking of a ship carrying Pickford is "Titanic" alike. The war intrigues become dramatic, as Pickford is slowly becoming a shelter for France, while the Germans occupy her ancestral home. Of course, the German lover Holt comes. It was hard to believe that they took so long to recognize each other as he entered the rape, but it was dark; and previous events they believed dead to each other. The film goes AWAY in its symbolism. Pickford was Canadian at the time - but few can deny that she was not a "Little American" for all purposes. <br /> <br /> FUN to see extras that later became big stars include Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially watch how Mr. Novarro displays a "star" quality during one of the more memorable rows of the film. Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other as he is on a stretcher. Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write a letter to him; Of course, he has a future in pictures. Ben Alexander is also bound in the future, playing the boy "Bobby"; He becomes a trusted child actor, and grows into a Jack Webb partner at "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Mary Pickford, Jack Holt, Raymond Hatton
