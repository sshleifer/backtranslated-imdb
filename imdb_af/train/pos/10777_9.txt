Radiofreccia is a movie about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It's a brilliant movie where a group of friends like us all live through the hassle of raising in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The movie does not take a happy or sad approach to things, but just tells us a story, one that we all experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sadness. The power of this story is that we grow to love the characters. It is one of those movies that you will watch over and over, closer to the village in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. One day I finally hope to walk his streets along Freccia and his friends and listen to the music that has changed the world through the creaking sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, their dreams, our dreams play. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will sometimes make you cry, it will comfort you, it will give you and take you away. Personally, I believe that it has played an important role in my life and that of my friends, and I suggest you all have to see it and make it part of yours.
