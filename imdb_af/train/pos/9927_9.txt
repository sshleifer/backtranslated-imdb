Domino is a good movie. It's about a young woman, Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and begins the adventures. The writing is good. Very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that it focuses on the different things they do, rather than the character of Domino. <br /> <br /> Also, Kiera Knightley gives a fiery performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this show. Mickey Rourke follows his Oscar-worthy performance in Sin City with another solid performance. Edgar Ramirez doesn't really do anything except to speak Spanish every time and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supportive performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although she surprised me on one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her plays with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie, however, is the direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. The cinematography is the best I've ever seen. It takes a regular film and sits on acid. All the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter, and it has a kind of green glow on it. The action scenes are exciting. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll love Domino.
