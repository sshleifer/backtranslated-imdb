Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but it is a beautiful film. Angela Lansbury is amazingly dotty as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was just brilliant. However, the kids just got the same glitter, but Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were actually not as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, actually all the songs are outstanding. The special effects were wonderful, with lots of magic, and the story was original enough. The highlights, though, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater series was beautiful, but my favorite was the soccer game, which was absolutely hilaries. The only other criticism was that I didn't get the end when I first saw it. All in all, a beautiful film, it's almost never been. 8/10 Bethany Cox
