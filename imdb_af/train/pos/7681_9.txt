Child Sex Ploitation is one of the most serious problems facing our world today and I was afraid that any film on the subject would come straight to plays of explicit sexual nature to shock and disturb the audience. Having seen 'Trade' and 'Holly', one movie surprised me to see a change in international laws. The other feels like a poor attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and the strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that this issue is being changed in a Hollywood tear cup, is a useful or essential strategy to adopt and I have to recommend making "Holly" to be subtle but powerful with the terrible circumstances of these children are unfortunately forced to endure. 'Trade' ranged between serious and silly scenes representing the death of a cat coming to the images, which represented children being forced to commit some horrible acts. I found this decoupling and sometimes offensive. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not have filed a film about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to see a powerful movie that actually means something, I suggest saving the money on the movie ticket for the release of 'Holly'.
