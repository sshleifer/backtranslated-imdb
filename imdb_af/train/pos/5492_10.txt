I was once impressed with Chavez's position against globalization, but it was only when I saw the film at the documentary international film festival in Amsterdam that I realized what he really achieved. This film tells the story of coup / conspiracy by the elite of Venezuela, the oil companies and oil that love corrupt Western governments, to democratically remove elected President Chavez and return Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This movie is for everyone who believes in freedom and justice, and it is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I recommend the people of Venezuela to take matters into their own hands and save their country from the kind of Halliburton and the Bush regime.
