Very interesting and intriguing film. The similarities with David Lynch (even literally quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the caretaker in this film is called Mrs Grubach, as one in Der Prozess ...) clearly present, but in this case is accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa. I cannot clearly describe the exact content of the film: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to handle such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central issue and its quest for social contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I have derived from the movie, but they are only impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you'll still discover a very fascinating movie filled with beautiful images (beautiful close ups of beatles, larva and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequence and also the dark atmosphere gives the film extra style). Perhaps you can say that I didn't really get the movie, but I watched as I hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mystery.
