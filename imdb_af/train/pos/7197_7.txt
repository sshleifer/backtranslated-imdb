There are several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, eg. Alain Delon. This role was also played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all time was always Reed Hadley. This series gives you the opportunity to see some interesting western creatures, where you will first discover the real villain Don del Oro. The series also has good performances from various films B such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains such as John Merton and Charles King and a very good performance from Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, well used his whip and sword, and his voice was best for any Zorro.
