There aren't many movies that made me feel like Stardust did everything in the film. As magical fairytale, like The Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000s as well as the 1990s. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with great images as well as memorable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, is especially a challenge for anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie you know very well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that captivates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not decimals less.
