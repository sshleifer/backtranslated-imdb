I think you should be from the US to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you want this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to that of the course, but of course the cameraman journey has been deliberately done. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure people from France won't appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this movie is not heard for a world. And while I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I want. I couldn't stop laughing all over the movie. My side and jaw injured at the end of the movie.
