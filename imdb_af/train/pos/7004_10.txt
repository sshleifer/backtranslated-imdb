Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I don't know how he does it. I constantly read books, but if there is a movie with Will Smith, I will see it. He has a rare gift to put you in the movie and keep you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched it on Saturday and still can't get it out of my head. AMAZING and sad everything at the same time. Thanks again. You have to watch this movie from start to finish to understand every part of the movie. You can't miss anything. Make sure you have many Kleenex and your husband / wife sitting next to you so you can hug. Well, appreciate the money you will pay to watch it. Don't wait for it to come on TV.
