Taking into account all the teenage movies like the Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink who are being rewarded. It is surprising that this one is so ignored. <br /> <br /> There is no sex in it, but sex is thought, including the idea that it may matter what others think about it. The children do not always come with their parents, but the parents or children are always considered right or wrong, and the parents are not seen as monsters. <br /> <br /> It's about heroism. How one girl did a dangerous thing, which could lead to really firmer before she realized she was wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie is kind of ahead of time. One child asks another child what birth control she uses. She says she does nothing to need birth control. She answers (wrong) "oral sex".
