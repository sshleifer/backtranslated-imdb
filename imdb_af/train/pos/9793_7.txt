I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. However, the movie needs more Robin. He appeared initially and sporadically in the rest. I always thought the new animated series had little justice to the neat new Robin character, let alone Knightwing. This movie continues only the bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I'd recommend watching it.
