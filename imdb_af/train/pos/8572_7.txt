The first movie was a nice one, but it's not as good as the wonderful animated classics I found more attractive and engaging. This successor is inferior, but not bad at all. Surely the slapstick is too much, the writing has its weak spots and the plot is a bit oninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious like the macaw. The movie is great to look at stylish cinematography and obvious costumes (especially Cruella's), and the music is enjoyable. The play is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive and Gerard Depardieu, while acting better, has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as with the first movie, is the incredible Glenn Close in a superb performance like Cruella, even more evil than she was before. Overall, beautiful. 7/10 Bethany Cox
