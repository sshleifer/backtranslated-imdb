It's a very nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat that is taken away for a while with someone else, but the animals don't understand and they escape and find the family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and she lives up to her name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. Shadow is the older and wiser dog that experiences things. Put the three together on an adventure and make it a happy and fun time. There are no special effects of the mouth moving, so it is not cheesy at all. This is the best talking animal movie I've seen so far. It's a great movie for families.
