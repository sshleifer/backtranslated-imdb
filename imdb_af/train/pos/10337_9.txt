This movie was extremely funny, I would like to own it for my vintage collection of the 1970s. Movie must see a list again, I know these role players, they are people I have met over the years and it asks me to look for this comedy. , unfortunately it was never placed on DVD or VHS. Reddish Foxx, always a comedy, Pearl Baily, a good match to his wife, spectacular, Norman, a secret boy, not sure if he will have a future if it is out, Dennis Dugan, crazy , funny man. Miss Dobson hooks with a heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties, this movie qualifies for a return encore, situation comedy with a variety of events, as it could and would find its way as a remake. I think to find will be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan role, it makes a few Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman is that you keep it in the nearest, impossible to reform as hooker girlfriend and infidelity of a parent. This movie was a wild cabbie ride advisor, reminding me of episode Kramer taking advice from his caddy about his lawyer. (episode of Seinfeld) The parents had jaws, instant pleasure, fun. Shout, bring me back.
