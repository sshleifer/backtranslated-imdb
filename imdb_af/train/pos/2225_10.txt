I'm totally shocked that this show has been canceled. It only lasted one year. I just recently started watching and I love it. It's a performance that's gone so far as Friends. It had the humor and was very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It's about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under one roof without one parent. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the part of the oldest brother and takes on the more paternal role. <br /> <br /> It took a lot more than a year because it was fantastic. Amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
