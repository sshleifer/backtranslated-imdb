I recently watched this movie, in a lazy Sunday afternoon, with my girlfriend and we have a lot of fun! This movie is a masterpiece of trash. Try to see it with this purpose! Of course, this was not expected, but the actions of the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the poor writing and the low-cost budget created a wonderful mix of folly. Tomba had just retired from alpine ski races, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world champions and nine World Cup titles. Serious about the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani signed this movie. All the other Damiani's directions are considerable.
