Hello Playmates. I recently watched this movie for the first time and this is also my first experience of Arthur Askey. I must admit that I was very impressed by this movie. As a fan of black and white movies in general, passport to pimlico, the lavender hill and Tommy Trinder (which is apparently a distant family member), this film has called for the fact that it provides good old-fashioned British humor has. I see there are a few who criticized Askey's performance, but I think the time test as a good example of forty comic plays and adding something to the picture creates characters that are more than mere stereotypes that look like as if now dominating movies. If you can get this movie, I recommend you get it. Shame these movies are usually no longer shown on Sunday afternoons. I'm also happy to have the opportunity to watch another piece. of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in dad's army). Thank you
