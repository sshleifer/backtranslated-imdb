This documentary is nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it's quite an impressive piece of work. Why it's not in print is a mystery that can only explain Disney. Good use of live footage and animation in tandem. It has been running for a few months or more as part of "Vault Disney", but I haven't seen it yet. * Suck * Most recommended.
