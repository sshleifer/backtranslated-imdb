It is a very well-made film, meticulously targeted and with an excellent character that sometimes moves in a deep way - for example, the scene with the loyal but unmoved sidekick policeman and his wife. The plot is convincingly worked out and exciting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. Clearly, the police are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters. <br /> <br /> A few small examples: I have found the end slightly unilateral, as it is the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and judicial system, which is the ambiguity of the police characters up until then. stand, collapses. I also found the main female character a little poor: little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, everything she looks like is crying and swinging as the tough guys fight it out.
