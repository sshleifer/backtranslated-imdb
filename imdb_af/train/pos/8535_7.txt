This work is a bold look at the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs. This film never tries to prune it, cotton tuck or soft soap the anxiety, confusion and pain of these guys living together. It's his strength, I think. <br /> <br /> But more so, the performances are fantastic, with well-thought out and delivered dialogue, which draws you in and makes you part of the experience. The characters never try to exclude the audience from knowing what they have in mind. It's in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it, but nice. <br /> <br /> It amounts to 6.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
