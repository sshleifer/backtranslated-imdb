What doesn't like this movie? Every year you know that you will get one or two yule ticks at Christmas and most of them will be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that has been well-presented. A very funny approach to a rich young man who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. It's nice to have money like this if you can't do it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich man gets Christmas as he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to handle and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly meet his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
