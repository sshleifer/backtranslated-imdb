Ted Mapes said on the doorstep of his Burbank house that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size in every garment except hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the biggest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro lit his mask, he was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> It was a bit exaggerated: there were times when Zorro was of course Reed Hadley, but in the stunts we can be satisfied that Ted was at work. <br /> <br /> And what stunts! "Zorro's Fighting Legion", like the commentary in this, is one of the largest series series. It is exciting and generally very good. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor, and as someone else commented, he made a very good joke. <br /> <br /> But, this is the action that makes this movie so good. <br /> <br /> And what can we expect, led by the excellent team, Witney and English, with good music from the incredibly productive William Lava (the list here says he was unreasonable, but that's wrong, the other composers listed here were indeed unreasonable, and I do not know if they wrote any of the music - it sounds like Lava) and with the villain of the great Charles King and dozens of pieces, among others? <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy was a villain who played by radio, Tarzan, Jim Pierce, who was Edgar Rice Burroughs' son-in-law. (I encourage you to read his mini-bio.) <br /> <br /> There is one chapter that slows down depressed, but it's only a few minutes (maybe 20) and if you blow through it, you is back on excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a great deal. THANK YOU for presenting this great series, and we need to ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we need to thank everyone involved for seeing it as a chapter game, or series, and not as a cutting edge.
