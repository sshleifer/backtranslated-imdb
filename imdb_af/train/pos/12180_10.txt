In my opinion, a Guy Thing is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic and absolutely beautiful chick wing that guys will enjoy as well. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were blinded as a confused groom and soon his sexy cousin. If you ask me, they illuminate the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I upload it, I would like to say the shows were top-notch, the direction was flawless, the production design was great, the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. Finally, to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You're in for a lot of laughter and excitement, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend and watch it.
