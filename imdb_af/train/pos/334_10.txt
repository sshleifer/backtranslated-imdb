It is very easy to qualify that movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the actions of the actors, they appear to be citizens of that era, 1100 B.C. They fit the characters perfectly. A second reason is that poetry expressing Homer in his poem is well-produced by the production. Among other things, the stories made by the choir give a special atmosphere that makes us part of the artistic depiction. Third Reason: The reconstitution of the d√©cor is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean, where the poem has been performed. And most of all, the emotion is on the rendezvous. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
