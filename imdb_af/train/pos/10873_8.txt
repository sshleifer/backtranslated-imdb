This movie really gets more recognition than getting it. It is really a beautiful and rich portrayal of blood bands, favors and dedications within the crime world. The film is beautifully shot and delved into all your classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a movie movie, it requires full attention and understanding and rewards. It is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire race, martial arts epic which seems to be the most important contribution to the biosphere from Hong Kong and China. It contains an arrangement of great characters, actors and development, but it is fair to say I had to see it twice just to nail what happened to some characters because they were so much in the movie. All in all 8/10 Great plot characters, but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really take me on and at times I felt it didn't sink well with the action (there's action by that way) so it loses points for it.
