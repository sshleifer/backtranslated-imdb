I love this movie. My friend, Marcus and I, were on the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled upon this fine movie. We didn't know what it was all about, but it got spectacular. 2 inches up. I love how the movie was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that also reminds you, I strongly encourage you to run to your local video store and find this movie. I will tell you about my favorite parts, but it can ruin the movie for you, so I won't. This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies. Do you really think nothing is hopeless?
