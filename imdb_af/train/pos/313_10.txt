I am a black American and I love this soap. I saw that it was baptized in Telemundo almost 5-7 years ago in Spanish. The story was a true story of a black slave whose love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and frank, whimsical way of life. Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She had what she had, nothing and saw her possibilities. Many will argue that she has sold herself - but she has tried to ensure her future and that of her future children. <br /> <br /> It was such an excellent soap that I thought would be released on DVD, but it was not released. This soap opera was the best soap operation. We have to show it on DVD or broadcast on TV. It currently plays on Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or in the US. We need it again for Telemundo.
