For those of you who don't have that reference, club fans were 4 fists that hit one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, on the review. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments have occurred at this stage. I remember watching. Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his working days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I'm here while everyone is listed. The point is that WCW had a wonderful timetable in the former Hogan days and they entertained television. Stiff Rhodes on comment in the later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when I started smoking as a teenager. I really wish Vince would put him on the microphone for a show or two, maybe at the next Big American Bass? They CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! He was wonderful. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
