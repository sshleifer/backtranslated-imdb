Have you ever wondered where the ideas for romance novels and other paper come back from? According to "Jake Speed", they are based on real people, living the adventures they write and publish. This movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence and fancy clothes at the worst. The language is not a problem either, and the jokes are funny at all levels. It's an 'Austin Powers' look at 'Indian Jones' without the overwhelming antics of Michael Myers. I recommend this movie for kids in the 10 to 15 series.
