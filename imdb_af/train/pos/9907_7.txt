"High Slaughter" is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s. This is one of the few films in the genre that is confused throughout. In addition, it also relies heavily on the standard scraping formula: A group of young men and women are killed one by one until the final jump. <br /> <br /> The reason why "High Slaughter" above most is movies in his genre is that it goes beyond the top. Marty, the murderer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. They forced him while standing naked in a girl's dressing room, stabbed with a spear on his crotch, and upstairs he embarked on his scientific laboratory experiment so that he could upset him. <br /> <br /> So, the victims in this movie are about as disagreeable as you get. When they are reunited years later - at a high school reunion that Marty herself uses, you realize that they haven't matured so much. They are a lot of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It is amazing why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to see the reunion, which is casually held at a school that has since fallen into disrepair. And who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor in the abandoned building in a room that has their old dressing rooms, as well as Marty's? There are many religions that the viewer must take to enjoy this movie. The end makes little or no sense. And the scriptwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works. The movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its mistakes. It is difficult to understand why it has not yet found its way to DVD, when so many other militias are donated with special issues.
