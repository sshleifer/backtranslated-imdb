Ossession is in a very bad condition, but is currently undergoing a full recovery at Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a "Master Positive" 2nd generation, originally from the printed Visconti that hid the fascists. It is scanned on the Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) then processed using DaVinci Revival recovery software. After that, the rest is handwork and we don't expect the finish before the early spring. Sometimes next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. This movie is beautiful and we hope that the recovery effort by many generations to come will enjoy.
