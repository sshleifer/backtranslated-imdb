My all-time favorite movie. Oscar caliber works by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The script is perfect and works the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other leading characters were drawn is a tribute to writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty had to win Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It's Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and change my opinion of Joan Plowright. After watching this movie at least 50 times, I can't find it. The music, by well-known composer Richard Rodney Bennet, is a miracle.
