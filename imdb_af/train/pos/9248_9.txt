Keep your husband found Jean Harlow, Brooklyn's working class girl who falls to the man Clark Gable and gets into all sorts of problems. The film starts with his movie, but by the time it gets over the emphasis, it definitely switches to her character. <br /> <br /> With Gable, the film makes a street competition with partner Garry Owen and screams for policemen. While chasing Gable ducks in Harlow's apartment and being such a beautiful man, she shields him. <br /> <br /> For a long time she was involved with him and unhappy with his shelves. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to pull a tie on a drunk Paul Hurst, but then Gable doesn't go with it. Of course, when Hurst realizes it was a game, he is still hurting and getting a fight and Gable has to emit him. But then he died outside Harlow's flat and the platinum blonde hair made her easy to identify. She goes on an accomplice to homicide. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is her and her adaptation to prison life. Her interaction with the other female prisoners gives her some very good scenes. I think some of the material was later used for the MGM classic Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets the title song and it's done as torch style ballad, very popular back in those days. She talks / sings it in the way of Sophie Tucker and very well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well-versed as the man who develops a conscience, a role he often plays, especially in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> Yet, it's Harlow shining in this movie. I think it's one of the best she did at MGM. Her supporters shouldn't miss it.
