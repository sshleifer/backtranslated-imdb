The people who treat this film badly are those who do not understand film. These are the people who love movie busters and negatives of any movie that does not die Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a neat, small movie that looks like the first clumsy and maybe even stupid, but what it lacks in plot makes it more than in the core. <br /> <br /> One thing in particular about the movie that impresses me was the use of music, which plays a major role. Those film music students will see how important music is in the film, both in Vida and Wilder's life than in the background. Wilder's theme, Vida's theme, and Wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some of the lyrics spell out. For example, in the scene where the men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is at Wilder when the men sing like "She is my girl" and then she goes to Wallace to give him something when the men sing the song. lyric "She will be my girl" cleverly shows the tension between the two brothers. There are all sorts of small developments like this in the movie, and while it looks like a flop on the outside, the real student of the movie will see how good this movie is.
