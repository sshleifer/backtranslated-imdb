I saw it as a kid in the late eighties and I have to say, Galaxy Express is one of those movies that have long been in your imagination. If you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this movie can be your golden ticket to Otaku Village. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The cell animation, while somewhat traditional, features a lively style that explodes Leiji Matsumoto's great character design and visual storytelling talent. <br /> <br /> It is one of those unique children's films such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Oz Wizard, who totally outdone family entertainment status, stand out as a classic cinema on its own. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
