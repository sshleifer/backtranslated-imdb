Although this film is somewhat filled with eighty cheese, I have a place for it in my DVD rack and I don't know why. I think I like it because the story's morale is: 'television is rubbish, so make it off and get a life'. For those of you who decide to obey the message, read the book, it's not like the movie. To destroy it at the end of the story, a deadly wounded Richards falls to catch a plane in the network building and kill himself, all inside and in the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be hard to compare it to 9/11.
