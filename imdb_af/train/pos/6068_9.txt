Red Skelton was another big star that made the transition from movies to television easy. <br /> <br /> His shows have certainly left a laugh for American households over the years. <br /> <br /> He would start an opening monologue. Then we will have a variety of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember one episode where King Red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness. <br /> <br /> Know that Red will use his comic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a boy at leukemia at the age of 11. His wife, Georgia, died suicide.
