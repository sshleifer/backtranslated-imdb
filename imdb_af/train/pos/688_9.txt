I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would like to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this movie, I'm very anxious to see what she can do with a big picture. Kudos to the movie for their tremendous performances (that little girl was gold), and for everyone who composed the music. The warped "Row Your Boat" blows me away. A lot of creative film around the world. I really hope it comes out on video or DVD, because I buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
