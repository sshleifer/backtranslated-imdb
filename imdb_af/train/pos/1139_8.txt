There are few comedies like this, where almost every line and character comes close to impeccable. This is soo funny !! And there's quite a bit of satire there. Sally Field is on her way to the field of truly excellent actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her TV diva that day. Sometimes her play is just a little too wide and up, but 90% of the time she's a riot! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopy Goldberg (which unfortunately has too little to do here). Downey Jr may not convince completely as a comedian and does not always have the timing right, but he is struggling with his part which is honestly ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch if ever there was one with more than one nasty secret (you'll see in the absolutely stunning final!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems quite comfortable in her part. I usually like Ms Shue, but here she is like a fish out of water and sometimes it looks like she's in another movie. But it is not something harmful and for the most part it is at least adequate. Otherwise, with persistent lines and situations, it's a comedy to watch when it's on TV or anywhere.
