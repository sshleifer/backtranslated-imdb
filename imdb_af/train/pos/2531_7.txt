Really good horror movie with the biggest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa to find an ancient meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoned by the radiation. All he touches, dies and the dark side of Rukh makes him a selfish killer. His friend, dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited solution to the problem and at the same time realizes that radiation can be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases. The two enemies will argue over the radiation possibilities. Pretty good special effects. Others in the movie: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
