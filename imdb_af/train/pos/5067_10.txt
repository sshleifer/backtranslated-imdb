Here, at IMDb.com, I read an opinion that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I don't know if he has better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was very exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing - the impressive hand of the film director. I respect me. The serenity, the beauty and the spirit of the desert are really illustrated exclusively. I have never seen such a close proximity in any movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing left in my mind is the movie, closest to the original books and atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> A little more. I pay my respect for the original Gray Owl.
