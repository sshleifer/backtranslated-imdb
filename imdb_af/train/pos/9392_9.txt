One night I came home and switched on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their pick of the week. I didn't hear anything from "Red Rock West" except two thumbs and saw it before it left. It won't be long in the theaters due to the money problems of the distributor and the lack of promotion, but they said it deserves better. <br /> <br /> The following afternoon I followed their advice. They were right, it was the most fun I ever had with the movies. As some readers point out, there are some plot holes and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's worth it for the good craftsmanship that went into the first hour. This is the best role I have ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone looks thrown perfectly. Dennis Hopper is almost over the top, being stupid, but strengthening how well everything works. The sets and music contribute almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Later, when I rented it to my family, it didn't work as well. The long scenes that built up the tension in the theater were hard to appreciate, with the distraction at home. It deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you're not disturbed, watch and listen to every scene, especially in the beginning.
