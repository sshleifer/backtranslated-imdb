I loved this movie very much when it was released, and I still do it because the storyline makes you hopeful about life in general, and also people ... one of the things I love about Lawrence Kasdan's films . In addition to the positive vibrations of the film, there are other reasons to keep Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an excellent role ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly-acclaimed film that won the Oscar for the best picture, was very similar to this movie. The difference is that Grand Canyon makes you feel positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon about Crash any day.
