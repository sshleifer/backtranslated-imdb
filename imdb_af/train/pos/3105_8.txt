The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and last outing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who kills the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest rated trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metakritic.com, which means it is "universal recognition" status) and for good reason - the battle is very well choreographed and the deep story can be very surprising. <br /> <br /> First of all, I strongly recommend you watch the Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy titles, after Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuation of The one who misses, makes you stranded and confused, just like I was. You'll still enjoy Ultimatum's action and fight if you've missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to confusion. /> <br /> If you were fortunate enough to watch the prequels to this movie, you probably had a surprise watching how Bourne struck down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him off the Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt. Damon. Damon does nothing to earn an Oscar note, bu His work here is good enough to keep his own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to ensure that the movie sometimes becomes inflexible. Bourne's agency tracing uses every technological tool that mankind knows to track down. <br /> <br /> I won't go into detail on the characters, because they are the continuation of the first two movies. However, it won't hurt the movie to spell out a few things to the audience. Not every viewer is a hard movie viewer who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum would not have been damaged if the story was a little more ahead. <br /> <br /> It seems like most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a movie: the movie opened $ 69m and - cash totals are now up to $ 216m. It is very strong for a movie that has been in theaters since August 3. This is the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very clever movie Bad) Story is like many others
