It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has it all - a sincere screenplay, subtle actors who make subtle beautiful art to look at, a really elegant romance (it's a pity that romance just don't seem to exist anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that make you want to live in it. The end was just a disappointment because I expected a spectacular movie to get a brilliant end - but it was even more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there. Definitely this movie definitely - over and over again. There are many details you miss the first time deserving a second look.
