This is the best of 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; she at least succeeded. He was one of the leading directors of the New Germany after World War II. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was wonderful like the cold, and calculated Maria Bruan, who lost her husband to the War, found him after taking an American soldier. As a lover, he lost him again after he had captured her and eventually found him agin. Her day and half of marriage before disappearing were longer than the time. <br /> <br /> It's life. Things come and go, and you do the best you can. You can stop or adapt to your way of thinking to survive. Even though Maria adjusted her mind and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, making the end such a tragedy. Excellent drama.
