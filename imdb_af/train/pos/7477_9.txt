This film has such a great emotion, especially with its excellent soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making and entertaining movies. This movie wasn't the best I watched it for the first time, but after about 3 times I decided it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and progresses through its lifestyle. He discovered a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing mixture of imagination. This movie was beyond my expectations and is one of Cruise's best movies ever!
