I don't know how this became a cult film. I think it's unfortunately overlooked as a real ingenious comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to beat itself off as a quick thriller, but to take on the quality of acting (good God it is bad) the storyline, the practical characteristics of the car's devil owning and considering the baby evacuation scene, there is nothing you can really do but laugh. And you laugh. Movies are made to entertain us, and the extent to which they do so can be an indication of the value of a movie. This film is the highlight of entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At one point I got little breath and almost choked, it's really that funny. When the baby was run by a helicopter with a robot pilot out of the sunroof, he retained a constant velocity, identical to the car, and a perfect flat wing surface which meant that the gripping hook was not in the car roof pieces torn. I laughed hysterically. But when the baby started turning around in the air, almost a bridge hit and almost tied into a tree, tears fell on my face. <br /> <br /> It also happened to me that the black police were the man who played Jesus in Madonna's "Like A Prayer" video. He looks everywhere.
