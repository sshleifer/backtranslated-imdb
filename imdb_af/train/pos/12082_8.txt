After watching this movie rigorously on the basis of judges' ratings, I was most pleasantly surprised. Although it is clearly a low budget, it is the sign of clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I thought that her isolation would be enhanced by an outer shoe that focused on her face and then moved backward to move into the house and its isolated place. included. And look, look! The next scene was exactly the last shot of the house standing alone on the cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how a clever director can raise his film to the level of a very pleasant thriller. Savvy viewers will surely see them, but be assured they won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Over the performances, George Macready is his regular, rogue self, who barely maintains his calm while suggesting a capacity for unsaturated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the no-nonsense working girl who didn't want to fight. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, even forced me to doubt my own eyes and believe she could get away with her evil schemes. <br /> <br /> It's a real diamond in the rough and shouldn't be missed.
