Grand Canyon falls under a very scarce category: it is a very clever movie, with very clever dialogues and food for the thought everywhere from start to finish. I have the impression that it never made it, because it is deserving (and never will) because of its simplicity. This kind of movie needs sensitive viewers. Sorry IMDb is writing my ten lines, because it is by no means necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the movie if there is something in the play: not that it is bad, but it could be done much better. Exception for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
