It's a very old fashion movie. The venues are wonderful and the situation is one of those old-time Preston sturgess movies. If you want to see a movie that doesn't demand much more, then to sit back and relax then that's it. The acting is good, and I really loved Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And while you sleep. The rest of the role is fun. It's just what happens when two people get married, meet the one who really loves them this weekend, planning their own weddings. I know ... sounds like cooking ... but it is. And it makes it fun to watch. This will embrace your girlfriend's girlfriend or leave you, but at least you will know.
