I love the whole house so much that I couldn't live without a home. Why did it end? It makes a lot of the fan of it. Can we have a Full House II? Oh, come on! But it's better that we have the DVD to help us. But I need the right people to come up with a new episode. Love, Heat is the house full! All the characters are very cute and beautiful! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse please come back to the screen please! How's Michelle after falling off a horse? How's Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or does he have a wife or at least a girl? Do they still live in the same house? I want to continue the life of the whole house! and don't upset me!
