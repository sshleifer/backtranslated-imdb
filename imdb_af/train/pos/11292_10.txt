I saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love. <br /> <br /> It took 30+ years, but I recently found it on DVD - it wasn't cheap, or - in a war movie catalog. We watched it for the first time last night. The sound was good, but it was granular and had the trailers rolling. Yet it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed with the importance of the play. <br /> <br /> The catalog is everywhere. If you are sincere in finding it, burn me a missile and I will see if I can get you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
