I don't know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a strange title and from the description it looks like something else. Every time it is good to try a movie that is slightly different from the mainstream Hollywood hero / thriller movie and this movie is definitely different. From the beginning, this movie had my plot, but I couldn't figure out why until the end of the movie when I realized the movie was good, because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was great and the character development really made you much cared for and hoped that things would be good for them eventually. I think everyone who watches the movie can somehow relate to one of the characters, and that makes for a good performance and some good laugh for the actors of the actors. <br /> <br /> At the height of the movie you definitely get a sense of well-being, and are left with the "things going well" - a sense of feeling. I'm sure it will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.
