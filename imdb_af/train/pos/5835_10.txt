Stan & Ollie become SAPS at SEA when their versatile small boat is named by an evil killer. <br /> <br /> The boys are great in this feature, starting with one of their most hilarious sets, the horn factory. Always a few steps away from the synchronization with the rest of Creation, Laurel & Hardy lives in a world where freezing radios and bedside billy goats are the rule, not the exception. With its short length, the film is more in style with its classic short subjects, which explain its episodic nature. <br /> <br /> Only the boys get screen credit, but movie people will recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears As a rewarding doctor, Richard Cramer is fully entitled to his bad guy role, sweet Mary Gordon plays the Boer's confused neighbor . This is Charlie Hall as the home office clerk and the silent screen competition Ben Turpin portrays a particular plumber. <br /> <br /> One of the film's authors was silent comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan & Ollie, however, are the main focus.
