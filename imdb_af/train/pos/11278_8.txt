The first of the Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been summed up so I can't think of it again. Just know that the actors playing Jane and Tarzan were born for the role. If you haven't seen this movie, and you just have the modern Tarzan movies as a reference. You're missing out on a real surprise. No matter how far we got into making movies, make-up set designs ... nobody will ever play Tarzan, as well as Johnny Weissmuller did it. He was and is Tarzan.
