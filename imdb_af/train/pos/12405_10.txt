This film was captured on video by chance in about 1990 and without knowing what I was for. Many horror fans may have missed this thought it was a typical prison movie and the one who got it did not like it because it was not what they wanted to see. The above factors are probably the reasons why it is lower, but ignore it and give it a whirl if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> It has a strong fit in all departments of the writing and atmosphere. to act and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> I still have an absolute diamond, a movie, on video today. Look at that.
