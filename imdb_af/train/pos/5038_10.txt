What a real treat and quite unexpected. That's what a real thriller movie is about. I drove to the video store, grabbed a movie without reading the whole blurb and hoping for the best. I was totally surprised and delighted. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all made a good performance and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. It has interested you from start to finish and has never become boring for a minute. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to those who like thrillers, especially well-played gamers, and those who keep your attention. Definitely a 10 out of 10 of me.
