It's a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong stock movies. Apart from it being a small plot, the poor drama and bits of comedy loss, the movie is action packs with gun control and martial arts action. Keep me entertained from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was great in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps Hong Kong's action strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
