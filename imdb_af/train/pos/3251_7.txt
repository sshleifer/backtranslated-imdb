Another repetition of "Fistful of Dollars", Sergio Leone's remake of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (represented by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This one is strictly a B-Movie; If taken, it's pretty nice. The direction is sharp, the acting full-featured, the limitations of direct-to-video photography well treated. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the movie is in the disastrous decision to plot the "fussy" / "yojimbo" to a sub-plot of Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Although Lone Both directed "Fistful" and "West", his motivation behind the two films could no longer be different. The Eastman is a frontier socio-road with a soft spot for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have had much to do with each other. To bring them together, 'Gun Crazy' must turn its plot and complicate it until we miss the story we actually follow. <br /> <br /> But it's a B-movie, and filled with action and folly; it is entertaining at that level, expecting nothing more.
