How to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a little romantic approach. <br /> <br /> This is actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) who breaks into journalism and magazine writing that is interpreted in a funny interpretation. way. Simon Pegg made a good appearance, slightly worse than his usual. Movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or something, but it has its moments, and those moments are really hilarious. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching America with English cream comedy to all those who just want to sit, relax and enjoy movie for what it is. If you look at this movie with a critical approach, you must succeed if you do not want to be disappointed and start wasting it.
