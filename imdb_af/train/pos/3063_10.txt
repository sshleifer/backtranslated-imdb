A first time director (Bromell) has played a small but powerful role in looking at the world of a middle-aged, middle-class, depressing hit and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This movie in less than 90 minutes offers an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6-year-old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing actor I've seen in a while. Macy is brilliant in a part that is almost written to him as a self-tortured tongue struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always great to see Donald Sutherland and here he is wonderful as Macy's reckless father. The film alternative soundtrack is worth hearing the director explaining how he has chosen the films, filmed places and the film. The basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this movie and is well recorded. The cinematography creates the mood with a very subtle musical background. Any movie buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
