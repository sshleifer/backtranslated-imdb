You probably already know it, but 5 additional episodes that have never been broadcast can be viewed on ABC.com. I've watched a lot of television over the past year and it's probably my favorite show. It is a crime that this beautifully written and up-to-date performance has been canceled. The actors that Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and Omg, Steven Caseman played, are incredible and so natural in those roles. Even the kids are wonderful. Wonderful display. So sad that it's gone. Of course, I wonder about the reasons why it was canceled. There is no way to make me believe me. Moynahan's pregnancy has something to do with it. It was in the perfect time slot in this market. I watched all the episodes on ABC.com again - I hope they all come out on DVD one day. Thanks for reading.
