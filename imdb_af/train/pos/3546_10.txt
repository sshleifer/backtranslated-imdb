One of the best musical ever made is an example of where producers and directors were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, rather than what people would expect. The lighting and set is unique, giving it a very interesting effect (it has a special name that I can't imagine). The dialogue is also unique because no contractions are used. The film is well played, beautifully performed and interesting from start to finish. A true joy is the MUSIC. Such an array of first-class songs, from start to finish, perfectly executed and orchestrated. Also the music is very original and very memorable, and I think better than many musical from the thirties to the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which may have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
