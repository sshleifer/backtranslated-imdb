If you like kung-fu movies and you haven't seen this movie, you're sorry. This movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapest that can be recommended for fans of all kinds of movies. Usually it takes a hard-fucking fan of the genre to see something in these movies, but this one has it all! The story is well told and completed. The battle scenes are great, and tend to end before you are completely bored (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw a little mystery and torture and you have yourself a movie of a movie. See this one at all costs. Heck, my wife even enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du there! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
