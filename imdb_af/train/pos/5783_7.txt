I read reviews of Kerching on IMDb, and frankly, I haven't seen one positive review so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenager named Taj Lewis, to make Â£ 1,000,000 for his mother, he sets up a website called rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things, just Taj, and its 2 friends - Danny and Seymour can stop Taj from exposing. I find this show pretty funny and I enjoy watching it. The acting is O.K, but it can certainly be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity makes him funny. and Taj's other friend Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the cafe, called the "The Chill". We never see him, we just hear him. Taj's younger brother Omar, and his older sister, Missy, are also funny. And Missy's best friend Kareesha. So many times, Taj's almost exposed. Besides the comedy, the drama in Kerching, like the love of life and the loss of loved ones, makes this program great.
