Although there is melodrama in the middle or rather at the bottom of this movie, the story is beautifully and subtly told and the play is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Yaara, who is studying at Princeton, returns to her homeland Israel for the funeral of her eldest and beloved friend, Talia. Because Yaara lived almost with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother, she lost her adoptive sister. And because Yaara, born of birth, is led and guarded by Talia, her friend's suicide is as intolerable as it is inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Inevitably, the blind girl is the one who decides the mystery of this death. Although without sight, she has insight. Although she cannot see, she is able to find what is out of sight as the "normal" people around her. The film therefore becomes a mysterious secret, as Yaara remembers clues in memories of her relationship with Talia, in her adoptive family home, in tapes, diaries and people in Talia's past and present. <br /> <br /> Tell Yara's Viewpoint, the movie is also seen from its point of view as she visualizes what she hears, believes and thinks. The solution to the mystery is quite conventional, but the search is done with such subtle care and the answer is so beautiful and without fanfare that the pat moment can be easily forgiven. The truths are gradually becoming relentlessly, and not only explaining Talia's life, but also her relationship with Yaara. Tali Sharon, as Yaara, uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is completely credible as both adult and teenage girl. We fully accept her ability through the film's end to find her place in the world more confident. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is the accuracy by which places and actions are repeated with small but meaningful variations that are never boring, the dead - the actions of the underage characters, and the interesting decision to only talk to Talia as a teenager. represent. I will be with Yaara's final statement, as it stands at Gadi, Talia's last boyfriend, on the edge of a rock, but I'm so fascinating that the picture will stay longer in sight than her words will be recalled.
