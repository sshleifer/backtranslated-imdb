I have very good memories of this movie, as I saw it with my two younger sisters when it was first shown in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently it's considered a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (the pan-and-scan video cassettes - which never fixed the picture, or the ambitious Panavision compositions are now out-of-print.) The movie is very stylized ( shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and albeit uneven. Some characters and rows are beautiful, while others are somewhat young and incomprehensible. The sadness hides blue camel (shades of Eeyore) and his blue song is truly heartwarming. Joe Raposo's songs are mostly beautiful. Definitely a valuable curiosity that will probably (unfortunately) fall into total darkness.
