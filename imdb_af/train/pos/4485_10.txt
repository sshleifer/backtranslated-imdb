This is my favorite of the early Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40's. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set, disk one, and displays the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons. The gags on this one are not all the crazy Avery style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who has ever turned up to watch horrible movies (or radio shows)! Tom listens to a creepy radio show, and Jerry decides to play a number of tricks to haunt him. The nine-life gag was well done here, and I don't know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that was scary when I was a child. When Tom's owner wakes up the ruckus - Mammy wasn't the girl, it was her home - she's got one big surprise, with a big laugh. Get your pause button ready, it's worth it!
