I watched Lion King more times than all my friends Togther have. With a baby sister ... you know what it is like. By now, I have both memorized the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out, I was as good, let me see ... the second one was considerably weaker ... then I saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2. I was as ok there we go again. After watching the 1 1/2, I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetition) were broken. A truly beautiful and original plot keeps you glued to your seat all the time. I noticed that the cartoon is filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao will apply 100% here. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend the cartoon.
