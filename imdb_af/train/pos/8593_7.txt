The Sentinel has a kind of run of the mill and clicks tension / secret, but is lifted with some good acting. These stories have for the most part gone as many permutations as we can carry, so how good is the acting, how smart is the set-up and bad guys, how well-made the main plot is. Etc. ..... so the Sentinel gave a solid job. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland retain both good screen bravado and attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) brings good support. The whole affair of the story is absolutely indisputable to beat it a little, but it deserves slack. Keep an eye out if you like the genre.
