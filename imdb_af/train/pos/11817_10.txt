I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I didn't know who one of the actors was, and I didn't know the movie would look different from the preview. I definitely loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty stars as the crime fighter of 1930's detective Dick Tracy, who goes to the biggest mobsters in the city. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very powerful man and will take over the city with his singer-friend Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) who has her eye on Tracy. It gets worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villians are back from the comic strip. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to watch especially as a child. Warren Beaty was like James Bond of the 1930s as he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> An ensemble movie of the movie includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus More! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Take my word for it.
