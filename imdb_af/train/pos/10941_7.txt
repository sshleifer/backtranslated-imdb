The thought that Sarah Silverman had her own show first made me worried. The movies she appeared in were not very funny and her humor was a little off. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shining in this Comedy Central jewel. I can put her in the right way like Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy. Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very similar to Sedaris's Jerri Blank. <br /> <br /> The downfall of this show is its supporting role. Her sister's character is good; Funny at times, but ultimately meant not to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is very subpar compared. <br /> <br /> However, I am pleased that Comedy Central Sarah has given her a chance to show her unique and crazy feelings of self and humor.
