This is simply an indication of what a TV movie should be made of. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in the grade school that we stumbled upon. The cheesy acting. The poorly written writing. The good cute boys. The ridiculous, but somehow obvious, clich√© and banal premise. The drive in the bakkie with your stuffed female look. It has everything. <br /> <br /> You will meet famous characters: Golden digs, stupid, rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends who know better, daddy knows better, but drives away son. And the woman looks. Propped up. In a takeaway. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Several things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies" since we looked at this beauty. Everyone involved in creation deserves a medal.
