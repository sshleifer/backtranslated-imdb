"California" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and can easily be regarded as one of the best psychic thrillers of the 90's. The film has a very attractive surface for it, but behind it are very disturbing and honest portrayals of murderers and the terrible violence they cause on others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is his performances. Brad Pitt is incredibly wonderful as a trailer psychologist named Early. Pitt spotlessly scares his scary character. Juliette Lewis is just as good at playing his naive girl, her innocence is almost heartbreaking. "California" has a very simple plot about it, moving slowly and slowly for about an hour, but it suddenly picks up in a sad spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, all of which depend on an ivy climax that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that really needs to be watched for its intense look at how monstrous a human can be, and not just for his violence and gore.
