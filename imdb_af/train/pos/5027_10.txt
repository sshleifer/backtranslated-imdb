I gave this movie a 10 because it had to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors AND my God the enging! The thing is, I don't want to tell anyone about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie. But I would recommend going straight to your nearest moviestore and renting it! (Don't forget popcorn!)
