BSG is one of my all time favorite TV series. I was lucky to start looking at it when the series came to the final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was! <br /> <br /> Once I noticed the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was, just under the title - Caprica! Although some things don't pick up when you compare two ranges, it's still beautifully executed. There was no mention of the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I didn't get far enough in the series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and would love to see you more!
