Watched it as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the movie said something because of the mother's stay with a daughter and went on a romantic journey. I was working hard on a new conservatory - Daniel Craig was no less - so the plot was immediately clear. <br /> <br /> It seems that the parable's carpenter's love interest is also the girl's boyfriend, so there is trouble brewing and not too many surprises. But I was caught by Anne Reid's compelling show and I was addicted. The direction gives her enough space to look in mirrors and adjust scarves when she radiates sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scene was fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies be covered? Not here and we are being treated for a wonderful revival in the mother's sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings she made, which (SPOILER!) Once discovered, confirms her daughter's suspicion that something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter didn't convince me as much as the rest of the throw, but it can be me. With her waves of pre-Raph locks I expected to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would better fit the confrontations into my mind. Bradshaw has a happier face that does not have the rage that emerges when the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If the farewell to Mother while she is ashamed is so indifferent, then we may see some close-ups of that shaky one immediately and see some of their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she was a recently lost widow and left for the lonely house she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I disguised the lack of sympathy. For a movie so full of emotion (and be warned, it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid again). The end is a cold contradiction.
