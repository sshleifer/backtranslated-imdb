I watched this movie and hear writer-director Juan Gerard at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy in the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affected his home and family. <br /> <br /> The opening phase will keep Cinema Paradiso in mind. In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "Rebel Without a Cause," references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore that often uses a black man as a kind of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is is the highlight of a dream. Gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are truly like the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover), but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and die in it. Keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and mysterious grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> Truthfully, the first half of the movie suffers from stiff delivery, and some persuasion, but stays with it. The last half is much better, as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax. This is Juan Gerard's first attempt, but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really comes through, in this sincere first attempt. I will definitely see it again, and hope he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
