It is no surprise that writer / director Michael Powell of 1946 considered a matter of life and death, and his and Emeric Pressburger's spell binding fantasy from 1946 to being his favorite of their films. In the aftermath of World War II, this colorful romantic adventure would have provided the tonic for a traumatized, restorative nation in need of a good upliftment. <br /> <br /> Following a series of other patriotic war films, The Archers made this one their peculiar, slim and most patriotic of fate. West Britain for maintaining British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners) is also evident in its Baroque compositions, technical ingenuity and a fine multi-ethnic role. classic, "It's a wonderful life," AMOLAD begins on a great expanse, with one of the great voice-over-preaching about the earth and the sky and what a great, wonderful world we live in. <br /> <br /> It then cuts inside a British cabin, hit hard, in flames and with the co-pilot who's already dead. It sounds wrong, but the connection will soon be made clear with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> In the near future, the quick change between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and US radio contact June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in his intimacy. Peter resigned to die, but Peter still exploits a lot of power, charm, and outpouring of confessions, and his warm affiliation with June closes with a mutual exchange of "I love you." <br /> <br /> With the magic of the moment Peter, by the oversight of his conductor 71, whose work it was to transport him to the "Other World", escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach. He met on a bike later in June and immediately adjusted the body with the voice. <br /> <br /> But the fact that they realize their mistakes, the High Court wants Peter to be sent back and ordered the French conductor (Maurice Goring) on ​​the earth to get him. However, Peter is determined to live as a result of June and the Consequence of the Conductor. He is deliberately the corner of his corner. <br /> <br /> Finally, Peter's fate lies with the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury consists of several deceased. war heroes and beautiful British delegates. The surreal trial, which was dissolved from B / W back in the rich Technicolor, could be a dream, but the last shot in hospital confirms the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> The abstract "frame to heaven" frame filling is used twice: first in b / w, when it raises up Peter and his enigmatic French guardian, giant statues of Peter's potential lawyers cross for the trial, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the softly lit color step gives the setting for what is an iconic image in the theater. Peter and June frozen next to each other, their marvelous eyes tied in the frame forward, sealed their fate. <br /> <br /> The unlikely love shared between Peter and June never becomes stale or surprising; It is treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already fit to be married and only have to convince people of their love so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French Conductor, who can freeze time and people's bodies, gathers a lot of their key moments, lecturing Peter on history and his ominous tricks. Peter's 'Top 100 Game Tricks' book and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> If visually inspired by other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, was it the first time their color combined with b / w? The latter has a cheerful quality when used for the sky zones, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The outstanding script is more than the imaginative set design, with a dialogue that sounds so instantly, it doesn't feel it's written or performed for the screen. Amusing and greasy, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves equal recognition with their color and composition forts. <br /> <br /> In 1946, a case of life and death is one of those films that it obsolete, fresh and inventive, even in this period where CGI would acquire its artificial effects, probably theirs of their emotional wonder bump. <br /> <br /> Other terrible changes will include the need for reduced average seconds for cuts and the inevitable plea to shorten the dialogue so that it can keep the low attention levels of most audiences. Powell weaves a game that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter's predicament.
