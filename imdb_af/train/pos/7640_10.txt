Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny's" theme is recovered from many films spanning many years. His theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots (see "Scrooged"), to the same, more serious and dramatic idea that worked in "It's a Wonderful Life" and a century earlier in the story of Scrooge as by Charles Dickens told in "A Christmas song." "It means that an ungrateful man is taken on a guided tour of his life and to see how his life could be or would be first hand. <br /> <br /> The guardian angel saves a man of ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect, or what it might have been, would have been .. In this case, we are shown a businessman called Larry (James Belushi). He lives with an unpleasant woman (Linda Hamilton) and longs for a bigger life with greater significance, but once he hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago, he is convinced that his life would be better. remember this seemingly small moment of his life, as it made a huge impact on his subconscious mind, but I doubt that a well-groomed man is looking for a single high school act, yet it works in the movie. <br /> < Anyway, Larry is home from work one night, where he is a coin with Jon Lovitz when he The car breaks down. He walks into a bar looking for a payphone, and decides unwilling to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) about the way his life turns out. This is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike. <br /> <br /> The barman listens and nods, apparently not worried about any other client. This is probably due to the fact that the pub, although old and clattered, was never occupied by any living person except these two men. In fact, Larry even commented on the fact that he had never seen the bar. It is probably for some reason that the audience is expecting Larry. <br /> <br /> So, the bartender, who can also be an angel of God, just like Clarence, makes Larry a special drink from her, eventually turning Larry's life and showing him what his life would be was as if he had run the house all the years before. But Larry didn't even have any idea of ​​any change, just as Jimmy Stewart didn't realize that Clarence had erased his life before entering the bar. Larry remains unaware of any change until he goes home to find the lawn differently, and a large wrestler who occupies his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon finds out that his life would be very different if he hit the home cup. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and moved into a big house with children. He finds out that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend, but an employee of his. And the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life, Larry always wanted ... he feels like his old wife, Linda Hamilton; Prove that sometimes money and a beautiful but shallow woman do not make everything in a man's life, such as an intelligent woman and love and true happiness. Just like "It's a wonderful life," the audience has shown how one's life is what he makes, and that every person has an impact on people, "Mr Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same As spiritual wealth, a lesson has taught us time and time again, but never so fluffy, forgetful and really sweet as it showed us in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is never extremely hilarious, but it is a lovely, evil comedy that never takes him too seriously. The problem with all "It's a wonderful life" is there, such as "The Family Man", that they try to be as influential and memorable as "It's a wonderful life". But there is just as much time that you can wipe a famous movie separately, and "Mr. Destiny" knows it and plays right on the fact. It doesn't try to be anything, it's not; rather, it is something it has not tried, and it is clear to the audience. <br /> <br />
