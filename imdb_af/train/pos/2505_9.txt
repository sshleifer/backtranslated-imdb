Many people rate it as a fan-service movie because many superstars in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee are very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge it before you look, is what I say. Gackt and staff were very serious when making this movie, and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a striking story inside. Several scenes can be so nice and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I couldn't stop watching it all again. <br /> <br /> The story wrote pretty well, but I admit that their actions are very disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his acting skills are among the others and it is strange to hear the way when he speaks with another language, except his native language (Japan). But it is understandable, because it is their first time in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak if they lose the most important person in their lives. When Toshi was murdered, Sho Kei asked to become Yi-Che to be a vampire like him, because he wouldn't let her die. When Sho's brother dies, Kei Shooting Boy dies and the best and beautiful scene is when Sho passes ~ Even I said Hyde's skill is quite strange, but I give him two bumps on that scene !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when The plot goes too fast, as they are not the reason why Son can't join the local mafia and Sho's enemy because they are a good friend of the past and Son is also Sho's son-in-law. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (very much ^^). <br /> <br /> It's an action movie with a beautiful, beautiful story.
