What is "Cry Freedom" like? It's just wonderful and unique experience about making South Africa and how black people in that country have been suppressed by whites. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, critically discussing the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon, Woods meets Biko and changes his views on him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (right from the top, even from the police chief). When Biko dies in police detention, Woods decides to write a book about him and it doesn't matter what he needs to publish. But Woods must escape from his country to publish the book and he must also put his family in second place so that the world can find out the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough has managed to make a good movie about people, with the main message that black and white are the same, because we are all people. Story leads us to South Africa and this (movie) is a great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that country and I'm disappointed that only 3,200 people rated this movie. It's a movie that we can all learn from. Although it is a bit long, this story cannot be briefly presented, as director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to get the book published after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Also, the relationship between Woods and Biko was great, just like the families of the two people and all the problems they are experiencing. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Biko's death) so that the truth can be revealed (Woods book).
