I saw this movie on several occasions. I find one of the funniest things to do, just to see the reactions of the different kinds of people who see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a fair-to-goodness samurai movie with many sword games and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon as the two protagonists start debating horror movies as their explosives enter almost randomly in their minds, the old people run out, usually disgusted. <br /> <br /> Type 2: MOVIE SNOBS. These people think that just because a movie bears the label of "Independent", it will automatically be a burden that is difficult to follow, overemotional crap that may be in English or not. Yet they just see it singing praise, so people will think they are intelligent and cultured. They are really in a surprise when they see this movie. As soon as the blood exaggerates from anime-inspired sword fighting or the upper culprit, shocking during a telephone conversation a dog with its crossbow, these people will be so upset, they will go out. Some just stayed to see how bad it was going to be, and later they were raving about what a horrible movie it was to their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE WHERE TO BE LIVE-ACTION ANIME OR MATRIX-LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS. Sorry, the martial arts are pretty solid in the movie, but director Yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITH NO EXPECTATION. These are the people who really enjoy the movie. Whether they heard of the Samurai's blood, chose it randomly, or stumbled into an alcoholic blast in the wrong theater, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it eventually is: ENTERTAINMENT . This movie is not made to illuminate or elicit deep spiritual thoughts. It was meant (if I could borrow a dialogue from the movie) to kick a little ass. And that's what it does. <br /> <br /> Depending on the type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this movie; However, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and enjoy an excess of blood and acting, check out this movie and make sure you bring your friends.
