All the people sitting here saying that this movie's bad link is the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was good or not for that annoying harpsichord. Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. How anyone can see it and not eat a kick from Joey Ramone who gets bean sprouts in the effort to keep him in the condition, is of course a wet blanket square daddy. Ms Trogar, the blast of white mice, the saddle patrols ... direct classic. Don't remember the Riff Randell character. <br /> <br /> If you don't like the Ramone, you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
