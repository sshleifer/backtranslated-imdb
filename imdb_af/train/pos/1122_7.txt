Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately, they have a flat band in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls testifies to a cruel murder in the forest. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare starts ... "Shallow graves" is a pleasantly low budget surprise. Throwing is similar enough, the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is pretty grim. The murderous sheriff is not a one-dimensional character, but a few scenes seem to be remorseful for what he did. The subplot in which the two boys they meet goes to dinner is nowhere, but the stalk ring in the bush is tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
