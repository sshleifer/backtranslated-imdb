The movie was very sweet and heart-warming! I almost cry every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone. The movie was so inspiring to me. The actors did a great job of acting and the movie was played very well. The movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of which she called Paulie. Paulie was divorced from her parents because they thought it would be best for her. <br /> <br /> After experiencing so many people, Paulie himself landed in a basement in a loft. Eventually, this Russian man who found a job as an officer. Paulie found in the basement and Paulie started talking to him about the story of his life. In the end, the man Paulie reunited with Marie (the girl Paulie raised). Love has overcome all the obstacles.
