You know the story. A group of racing no-hopers enter a competition that they seem to have no chance of winning. It's a Hollywood story. Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best etc.). Now does Korea give it a go with a Taekwondo team struggling for glory? and guess what ?? The result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie does not fall flat on its face is down to the talented young role that really cares about the characters, and it in turn keeps you looking to the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu movies; The action is limited to (impressive) kicking and occasional punching. It doesn't matter, as it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle to make something of themselves that makes this movie a success.
