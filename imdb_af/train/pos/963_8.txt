Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried that he would do a children's movie because I would hate to see him leave his movies. I came to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and the black sociological trilogy. Lately, he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he succeeds. Yet it was the first of his films that I saw taking that direction, so I was nervous. Of coarse I bought it without seeing it and was glad I did it. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect kid's movie and adults should love it too. The whole movie reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Back to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those movies because they didn't treat children like they were stupid and this one either. The dark underlying morality is there, but it is as stupid as any kid's film should be. I'm personally not bothered by CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and don't think children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a strong Takashi Miike fan, you may not like this one. But I suggest giving it a shot. It proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspect he is. He also keeps his signature Miike films outside this one, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those new to Takashi Miike and want it to be something light or dramatic like this, I suggest that these other Miike movies: "Sebraman" "The Happiness of the Katakuris" 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China.' <br /> <br /> Good work, Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
