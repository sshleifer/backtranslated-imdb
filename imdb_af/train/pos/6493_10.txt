I remember it as a kid in the UK, fascinated by the story and Laurence Olivier's story. We'll talk about nothing else at school the next day. I think the ratings for the first show were great. It's simply the best comprehensive documentary series, despite the fact that they had to cut the story to the bone. Interestingly, the battles of Britain and North Africa were decisive but not widely recognized by the Americans as such. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the east, the abuse of Japanese prisoners of war by US troops. The images of the Holocaust have always been guilty of the treatment of the Jewish people, a non-Jewish European. I don't know why it's not number one in the IMDb rankings. Maybe they show their bias against documentary programs. Spoiler - we win.
