Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He quit his troubles on his older sister, killing him at the start of the movie. It's just the beginning of things coming from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who has been studying Myers for many years. He knows there is something else about him, something mysterious bad. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> Following an escape from an institution, Myers follows his younger sister. If he kills her, the problems of this misunderstood boy can come to an end. But he seems to have trouble finishing his sister as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for the one girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of those horror movies that teenagers are being hit by a masked or horrific killer. But this one started everything, kind of. If you think about it, most of the horror movies we all remember are those that Freddy Kruger or Jason have about half-half girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't haunt our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloween's director, John Carpenter, has a lot of 50's horror movies and combined everything he knew into one movie that shot dead at the end of the 70s of many in the late 70's. These films have strengthened him as a director to watch and also start the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl played by the masked killer. <br /> <br /> This movie may look like today but then there wasn't much out there. It's copied from and ripped off, but Halloween will always be the actual teenage horror movie. It still gives you cold fever, listening to Carpenter's exciting music while seeing another victim chased by the shadow Michael Myers.
