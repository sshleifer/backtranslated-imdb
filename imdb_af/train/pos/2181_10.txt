<br /> <br /> Artistic shooting, actors portray their role exactly. You get a real feeling of watching Lucienne rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl. A feeling of tragedy to conquer again tragedy. All in all, I saw this movie at least 10 times. And can very well say that Prix De Beute '(The Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) is a GREAT favorite in my silent movie collection. The expression of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty along with a tragic story line.
