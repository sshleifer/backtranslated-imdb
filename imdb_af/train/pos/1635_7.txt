back in my high school days in Salina Kansas, they filmed something called "The Brave Young Men Of Weinberg", filmed locally, and film staff were prominent for weeks. Eventually, we learned that the movie was "Up The Academy", and a little ummm, "lower brow" than we had to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it as I was there, and local audiences were less than happy with the show. I was 17, and thought it was a pretty relentless attempt to make a kind of "comedy" kind of comedy, right up to the jokes. <br /> <br /> Have you seen this many times since, and my opinion has been a little choked. It's stupid, but sometimes it gets a bit of the "crazy" magazine humor, at least as well as most "Mad TV". Ron Liebman can hate it, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment was a short scene on the Santa Fe Avenue, where I parked my car while I bought guitar strings. Sorry, my Pinto's short look usually looks cut for TV. didn't see the new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
