Well, it was one of those movies I caught on the outside and it was good enough for me to record when it appeared next time. If I, like me, enjoy many 80's horror flicks that have a bit of branching out of the norm (that is, not just another generic successor), then I think you might enjoy it. When the bad man finally arrives personally, he was definitely not what I expected to see! All in all, I will not go for this one, but if you like the genre, see if it comes and you have half an hour to kill, I think. I'll give it 6.5 out of 10.
