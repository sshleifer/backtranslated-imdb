I remember first to watch Sabrina when it came to TVV in the UK on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I'm now 24 and still love it as much as I did when I first looked at it. I get a little stick from some of my friends to watch another "kids show", but I don't mind! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan also became one of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time seeing several special events Sabrina won at Nickeleode UK TV station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was wonderful in Clarrissa Explains All, but so much better in this. I was killed when they decided to finish it! I hope it will be released on DVD here in the UK soon - I'll be in line first! lol x
