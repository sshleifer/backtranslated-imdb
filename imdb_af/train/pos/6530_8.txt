I read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago, so much of my fictional character's memory is probably wrong. From what I came together, the books were introduced to me in an era when teenage huts were popular with children who were growing up (for me, the 80's and early 90's), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five, and of course, "Carolyn Keene "Nancy Drew said among the more famous. I still remember the hardcover books with many dated cover illustrations, usually very heavy (for a child) to fly around, and the thickness of the book may be due to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts. <br /> <br /> Well, the character has been given some upgrades along the way, as I remember my sister's subsequent Nancy Drew books becoming less thick with softcover, with updated and more chic Nancy up the cover page is illustrated. I can't remember the stories being the same as the old hardcover, but I think these books, which are written, have their fair share of updating themselves for the times. <br /> <br /> In this Warner Brothers edition of Nancy Drew, the character gets his job to fit the times, but writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen have maintained the sensitivity of the small town. By doing so, they have the charm and taste that people, like me, will appreciate. Her fashion sense, her prim and agility, even some peculiar little behaviors that make her good, well, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> Her family background remains more or less the same, which, along with her single parent, Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who moves his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job, and for her daughter pruning in the village of River Heights. Mom is a distant memory, and the roommate makes a cameo. But what Nancy Drew is doing is the mainstay of Emma Roberts. Niggie from her famous aunt Julia, she also has that speedy attitude, that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile. Her Nancy Drew, while initially in the wrong way, will actually grow on you. And in almost what I thought it might be a discarded scene of Pretty Woman, the characters with almost opposite reactions went into an attractive store. <br /> <br /> While Dad Carson Drew is trying to get Nancy out of her sleuthing. environment and to assimilate into the normal teen life, Nancy trusts to find herself in a homeowner whose owner, a Hollywood type, has been murdered under missing circumstances. Mystery Solution is her comfort food if she finds herself an eradication of the local brotherhood, and not long before we come along with her on her big-screen adventure. <br /> <br /> There is nothing at Black Dahlia about crime and mystery, and instead it's a pretty easy piece for Nancy to solve, between Corky (Josh Flitter), a friendly friend of the school, and pacifying jealous friend Ned (Max Thieriot), while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her father. The story is sown with chaste pleasure and a cute sentimentality that charms, and together it becomes slightly scooby-doo like. With minimal violence and no big bag fights or explosions, it's seriously a genre that is clearly marked with a "chick flick" warning. <br /> <br /> I think the movie will generate a new generation of fans, the memories of old people recovering, and probably, probably, may spark a new fashion trend of sports penny loafers.
