In pursuit of the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future, as evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to the earth to kill human Bill and Ted change the future. <br /> <br /> In a great comedy combination, Winter and Reeves are performing great humor for the audience in this entertaining sequel. Although the spectacle of the first is not enough, Bogus Journey still has the great pairings and dialogue of the front pair, not to mention a hilarious show by William Sadler, which is a humorous side to the depth of the grim lean bring. Look at the games sequences, the best moment in the whole movie, but one of the many good techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> While still full of humor, this movie has a more dramatic movie, with more serious input and more risky situations. <br /> <br /> It gives the film a big dimension and another lovely feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven heavily symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is once again on the lookout for using that incredible time traveling machine, but again somewhat confusing at times when using timing, and objects and situations are placed before they happen in the present, as evidenced by the last couple of scenes. . <br /> <br /> The first look, I hated this successor, but the second time was a real joy, as I appreciated the jokes and story more and although the jokes and plot are not as strong as its predecessor No, Bogus Journey has enough feeling good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natural family movie.
