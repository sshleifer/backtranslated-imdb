After looking at the other comments, I complained about this submission. <br /> <br /> The two primary characters are attractive in their own way - the beautiful "victim" and the attractive, obviously very mid-pointed "blue-frame protagonist" - turns the hell apart, like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. <br /> <br /> It's good, and of course it's a "turn-the-tables" story. But my referenced complaint is that I believe the director is trapped in his desire to show Farrah's familiar and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with the fact that she is attractively dressed in a thin garment, and with a number of scenes that are more than necessary for any dramatic effect - while being extremely pleasing to the eyes, it derives from the poignancy level of the play . <br /> <br /> Her roommates I'm sure give are actions such as writing and writing - but their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, not true - based on Farrah's previous experience with this man that he came to them a site with only the worst intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to exaggerate what had happened. <br /> <br /> But it's a movie and story that forces so much despite, because of, the director's work.
