Apart from the fact that my list is favorite movie makers: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Almighty 3) the rest ... this movie is actually better than the book (and the TV miniseries although it's an easy feat, considering the director). The flawless filming style, the play and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) is the music - making it the masterpiece of horror. I looked at the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got it. THIS HAS MY GO !!! It's much better than I ever thought. It starts slowly (Kubrick brand) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the tension. The intro scene is a classic anyway, and I watched it just about 20 times just for the moving atmosphere that makes it the whole movie. Also, the film does not offer much gore (it only has enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend I hate in the past day's horror movies. Just look at it!
