A very promising director debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller / what-really done-it recommended by Stephen King. It is a strong, benevolent horror story about a dedicated but demented man in Thurman, Texas, who is murdered after giving orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control man. A few of the plot turns and a rogue end up makes you earn money. Most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the turned man to be known as the Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the demented man's eldest son who eventually tells this story to a Dallas FBI Agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Shocking white knuckler! Highly recommended.
