It was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a series of six called "Frenchfilm" to brush our French before our planned holiday in the beautiful Provence this year. So far, as well as improving our French, we have greatly improved our appreciation for French theater. <br /> <br /> What a fresh air to the fanciful, predictable, imaginative, incessant slapstick eliminated by Hollywood. What a great example for screenwriters, actors, directors and films. It was so stimulating to also see two identifiable characters starring, without having to be glossy magazines. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about this movie was the slow character and plot that made it guess how it all ends. Is there really good in this selfish villain who constantly deals with his seemingly naive benefactor with the kind of contempt that an ex-con would display? Will our sexually frustrated, small, half-deaf heroine prove to herself the answer to her dreams and the situation that gave her the fate? The viewer is inspired by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly, as they face faces that challenge them and express their feelings towards each other. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen this movie, you might like to see it again. I still have to work out the director's psychological motif for the subplot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The plot asks for a little imagination when our hero gets a chance to help our abused and overworked heroine in the office. You also need to be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. But if you're going on this exciting movie with the French movie on the exciting ride, you'll be more than happy. Four stars out of five for me.
