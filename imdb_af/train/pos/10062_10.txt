Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect. It looks like it's the only movie written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in him. <br /> <br /> The acting is sublime. Renating Zhou as Doggie was wonderful - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a joy - very credible like the old traditional tradition. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, guided without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only more movies like this were made, either in Hollywood or Hong Kong, a family-friendly, well-maintained, well-written, well-directed, near-perfect gem.
