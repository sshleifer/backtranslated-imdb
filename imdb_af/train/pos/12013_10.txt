Having read the commentary on this movie and having seen the mixed reviews, I decided that I would be worth ten cents saying I thought the movie was excellent, not just in the visual beauty, writing, music counting, acting and directing, but crossing the story of Joseph Smith and the road, he traveled through the life of suffering and persecution to believe in God as he felt and knew he would be his way. I am very happy to tell the story of this remarkable man. I commend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she is allowed to walk, it only sets one with more determination to live the life we ​​need with true values ​​of love and forgiveness like the Savior we learned. to do.
