It's probably not fair that I should see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then add what people have forgotten, but oh well ....... <br /> <br /> From a view of acting, how can any actor with these characters fail? Each one fascinating and intense in their pursuit of life. Tony Sopran - while a crowd of "Capo" and mental illness experience, sees his life in front of him and knows what needs to be done to survive. Each of his men, you see their lives virtually inside, like the true form of voyage. It definitely brings a kind of "nose" to each viewer, and I include myself in it! <br /> <br /> While some do not care for Bracco above, I have to say this is the latest role she had Good Fellas years ago. She is the side of Tony who calls him the reason, which makes him decent, giving him a break when dealing with his human emotions that he has never felt. She's simply put, she saves. (Not spoken in religious colors) <br /> <br /> But knockout performance here is without a doubt, Edie Falco. To see her jailer role in the other well-known HBO series, "Oz" and see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. She exceeded the boundaries of a recognizable actress, and only actresses like Merle Streep can get away. A kind of chameleon quality to surpass roles. But as I have already mentioned, with a strong character like this, how can any actor fail? <br /> <br /> Livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. She is a survivor because she hopes her husband and family will be survivors. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband's business, but knows the lifestyle she has is more than most women in Jersey. She's wise if it's not wiser and more street-wise than Tony herself. <br /> <br /> All in all, the biggest crime of the Soprano family is that we have to wait for the viewer until January 2000 to see the next season. In my opinion, this is the worst of the HBO series. This was what the Larry Sanders show, sex and the city brought, dreamed up, and others returned in popularity and eventually killed them. Too much space between seasons and very sporadic. Until then I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap is filled in programming.
