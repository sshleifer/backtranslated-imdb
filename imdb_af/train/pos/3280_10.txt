I only saw this film once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it, I think it's even better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than just an abomination. It had such an incredible level of emotion and great characterization through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was very good here. It's a pity she didn't do anything else because she was an excellent actress. Her depiction of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end when she realized Marc was already dead, but she knew he was going to be good. <br /> <br /> Several scenes have made me jump (which is a rarity to me in modern horror movies), especially the scene in the bath, the scene where Anna's dad followed her with the strange radio and the little the bones break apart and crumble to dust. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent and very moving movie.
