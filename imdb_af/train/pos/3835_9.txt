This movie is wonderful - it's just like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark decors, the floating insects everywhere, the idea jumps and the surreal dreams ... Really great! People who love cultivated films or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic one. It looks a bit like the films of David Lynch: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. Rather, it is a sequence of surrealistic events, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the movie has a very fascinating plot with excitement with a fascinating unbundling, I'd give it 10 out of 10 But it is missing, and so I gave the movie a 8. Nuit Noire. It's a movie worth watching. Find that DVD and you'll be rewarded!
