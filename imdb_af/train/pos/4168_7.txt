Not only does this film have one of the big movie titles, it's the third team of 70-year-old actors, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember this movie being broadcast Halloween Week back in '78 against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House. I missed it for the first time to watch the other movie. Later, I saw that I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but it really lacks chills or surprises. Although, I like the scene where Richard Crenna doesn't use the family dog.
