I remember Casper's comic books, but don't remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable; I don't know, but at my advanced age, here I am watching this very early Casper yesterday. Then I was shocked to read the user comments here. Did people miss the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other ghosts, who like to go out every night and scare the c-p from everyone. "He sees no future in it," according to the narrator here. Instead, one night he goes out to the rural village, accidentally frightening some animals and finding no friends. It brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him. The two become girlfriends, but soon the fox runs for his life with a fox hunt going on. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mentioned everything that happened, so I also touched it. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is in tears because he lost the "only friend I ever had". But no one calls the happy ending to this story. "Ferdie" the fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, jumping on his lap, licking his face and the narrator commenting "they have fortunately ever lived." Both characters look cute. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about it? It's a nice story with a nice, happy ending.
