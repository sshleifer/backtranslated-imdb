Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that they see through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed immediately, but they seem to be the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a continually oozing mass of humanoid pulp; As he turns into a cruel killer, who melts every step of the way, he gets through his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) traced. <br /> <br /> It's often so unruly funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - it's hard for me to believe that the laugh is all unintentional. It seems to me to be a faint on the low-budget genre efforts from the 50's and 60's, and as such, it's a wonderfully entertaining movie. The sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We are even treated in a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a guest to watch. <br /> <br /> Author / director William Sachs earns credit to come up with this ingenious idea; its ultra-slim character is indeed a memorable one. I think his pacing is a bit off; Some scenes (such as the one with the elderly couple) go a bit long, but eventually he produces solid, lousy, B-sized movies. The climax is very nice. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is nice shuddery (but also amusingly silly in some moments), and Willy Curtis's cinematography sometimes creates very good shots. This brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and compelling makeup effects, which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie, to the ultimate final melt. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under the hard make-up for almost the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for the fact that the movie runs the ground) and does what it needs to do well. DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and stupid hero and Ann Sweeney is also not as hot as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge, and Lisle Wilson are fine in support. It's also worth seeing people like Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith, Janus Blythe (from Tobe Hoopers' "Eaten Alive" and West Cravens's "The Hills Have Eyes") and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit. <br /> <br /> It is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore, cold fever, and laughs as a worthy value for low-grade sci-fi / horror lovers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
