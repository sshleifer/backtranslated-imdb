If any show in the last ten years has earned a 10, this is this rare jewel. It allows us to return to a time when things were simpler and tastier. Filled with heart and laughter, this show lets you laugh through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and the same drugs were tolerant. The hair was fatter, the music was accompanied by roller skates, and in the words of Merle Haggard a joint was a bad place to be. Go back to the best time in American history. Fall in love with characters and feel the goodness of the small town where people were better off. These classics are on television as much as "Full House". Don't miss it, and always remember to shake your groove thing! "
