Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell to his director debate "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", they played together in this movie. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, who showed that they really believed in this project. In potential it also looks like a fine and entertaining project, it is in line with movie remakes like "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this movie is only half full of success, or at least it is not as good as it could have been. <br /> <br /> The movie's characters are all played by some well-known actors, but it is a pity that the characters don't really get enough space to develop. Although they could have been in their potential for fun and fun characters, they are now simply entertaining characters, mostly from some of the more peculiar rows in the movie. The fact that they are playing does not change much about this, although they prevent their characters from ever drilling a total or perhaps even annoying, or something. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, due to the fact that the characters are not being used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this film. The movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is still a great place to watch, perhaps because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless little video, in which you don't have to worry much about the story. In this respect, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works out and only its purpose. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you won't regret when you finish it, but it's also a movie you can really do without ever seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
