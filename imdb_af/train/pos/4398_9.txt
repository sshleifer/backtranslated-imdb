When I heard this movie was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. A few years ago, this Taiwanese director became known as "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" and then continued with "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now he points his attention to another American icon - the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, a Union state with southern sympathy. They never officially joined the Confederate Army. Instead, they formed illegal bands called "forest growers," their hair grew long, and they sometimes confiscated Union uniforms that they wore on their regular clothes. <br /> <br /> The film shows their moral dilemma, the high drama of times, and their so-called heroic commands to kill farmers and farmers who helped the Union. There is no star in this movie unless you consider the singer, Jewel, as a young ally widow as a star. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is thrown as a young German farm boy who has been disrupted for his legacy because the Germans were Union sympathizers. This young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh-faced youth, whose performance includes his wonder and subtle realizations, as he is exposed to the horror of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave traveling with the forest wanderers, because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. He gives a fine and understated performance. <br /> <br /> However, some of the actors are wood, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. And their costumes are too new. And the "southern gentleman" theme of manners and harassment and politeness towards women is common - especially as they make the point of killing all the men they pull off their wives' arms and then burning the stores and houses. <br /> <br /> While I don't think it will fall as one of Lee Ang's "big" movies, I am intrigued by it, despite the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes. I was interested in what happens next and feel empathy for each of the characters who all appeared to be true and imperfect people trapped in the powers of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much action as the ordinary war does film, but still recommended - especially for civil war buffs. <br /> <br />
