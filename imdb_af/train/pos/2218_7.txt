I know this movie wasn't originally a cashier hit, but in the light of recent Hollywood releases (most of which are definitely formula-driven, plot less, useless, "red-the-blonde-chick-no- matter- what "bravery", Holy of Holies, sure in this sorry context deserves a second opinion. The film - like the book - loses ground in some of the historical backgrounds, but it presents a unique American dilemma against the unique, horrible American institution of human slavery, and some of its tragic (and funny and touching) consequences . <br /> <br /> And worthy of singing, youthful Robert Ri'chard, cast as the leading figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal, as set out at the beginning of his "age" . just to be cruelly disappointed about what seems to be his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of Louisiana, at the point of the antebellum period. When I saw the previews with the (dreaded) blonde hair Ri'chard, I was expecting a buffoon, a jerk, a caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, the late Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy give lively footage and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop of tapestry, voodoo, Creole "aristocracy" and Haitian rebellion in this story of human passion, hatred, love, family, and racist confusion in a society that is supposedly gone and yet somehow with us.
