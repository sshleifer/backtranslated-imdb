I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat the line and remind myself how good it is with a show. I'm a big sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science (fiction?) Show in the history of film / TV. There are so many theories in this show about the universe that I could start with a religion. I'm a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (19 now) and I find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how each character is almost the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> Back when I first saw Stargate, I immediately liked it and considered one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, and then a TV show will turn out, I'm excited affected, but did not nearly show up until the fifth season. <br /> <br /> However, I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies, but the studio chose the series instead. <br /> <br /> Id says it looks just fine. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is great, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis here we come!
