This is a very difficult movie to watch, especially as it is the inner core of our lives. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving movie. Anyone who finds it cynical must say that they have completely missed the point of the entire movie. For those who actually watch the movie, they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely essential and ultimately the outcome fails. Sure, it is very difficult to watch, a difficult subject and even brutal. Yet it is extremely important for society and everyone. It shows the highlight of the world kiosk currently being done (I will not limit the term to France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is best to go with a clear head without being contradictory, and just let the movie work for you.
