The movie wasn't that good. The book is better. But the movie wasn't too bad either. It was interesting to say the least. The plot had enough tension to make me look, though I wouldn't say I'm actually interested in the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both beautiful enough to make you look :) They have some cute plays that should appeal to the romantic. Overall I want to give the movie a 7 or 8. It wasn't bad, just a little short sense.
