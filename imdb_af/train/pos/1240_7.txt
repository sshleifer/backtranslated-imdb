Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends his time finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child. Skeptical and pure through lust and intrigue, Jarrell becomes involved without realizing he is going on a fantastic journey, involving the danger and worst of all, the devil Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is The Golden Child a product of his time, with it meant, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s? Because I can remember how much this movie entertained people in that decade. It was the $ 79,817,937 checkout, which became the eighth largest earner of 1986, but since the 80's disappeared from memory it has become the thing to deny Eddie Murphy photos. comedy awards they actually once had. The Golden Child does not like the more accepted 80's Murphy photos such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but when repeating the movie I personally found it to be Murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best! <Br /> <br /> The Golden Child enters all the necessary genre buttons to capture a fantasy action formula re-confirmed by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981. Beautiful girl, daring reluctant hero with a rage in his armor, villain villain {Charles Dance so English I can kiss him myself], wonderful color and a cute child with mystical powers, the movie just asks you to get involved in the fun, not to analyze its value as a cranial fantasy image. Yes, the CGI devil now looks cracking and yes, the genre had much better pictures in the 80s, 90s and older. But if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site, then just take this genre a little seriously, seriously. 10/07
