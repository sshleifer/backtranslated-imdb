No, I'm not joking. If ever, ever, the chance to see this movie, see it. If you have to cut your arm to see it, see it. It is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Fats drive The bus is different from any movie you have ever seen. It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art. While it contains poor shots, idiotic characters, bad dialogue, strange acting and cinematography appearing in public access in Iowa, it actually succeeds in its purpose as a movie. It strives to be the stupidest, strangest, most unpleasant movie you've ever seen. And the boy ever succeeds. <br /> <br /> I will explain the plot to those of you who are concerned about such things (the filmmakers do not, of course), but you really shouldn't pay too much attention because the whole movie's plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits. Anyway, FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus trip through Chicago, led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in town, and all the passengers on the bus have to die, and all their souls will have gone to hell, except with Jesus in town, a lack of hell cries out the work, and it makes Satan angry because Well, he does not like to look like a fool in front of the man, so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign him directly over their souls, but he is a devil, therefore he must disguise himself, or else go with him with him, so he hides himself as Roger and he gets on the bus, where the driver is never called by name, but he is fat, so i think he's fat. The bus (and the riders) is on a collision course with wackiness! <br /> <br /> Examples of some lunacy: The title repeats 3 times on the screen. I do not know why. A character appears on the bus in the middle of the ride without explanation or introduction, and sometimes sits alongside the other, and they look at her as she doesn't belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and range from desiring cans, these are actually the same shots that are repeated over and over. I do not know why. After Satan gave a minute monologue on the conversion into human form, a title card flashes "Satan is going to transform." I do not know why. One character is a woman who is naturally a man in tow, and is referred to by other characters as "the glamorous Bridget." I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If there was one good thing that came from Troma from Troma last year, I get my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
