Although obviously a low-budget production, the performances and songs in this movie are worth seeing. One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (he is a wonderful dancer and singer and he also demonstrates his acrobatic skills - look for the wheel!). Also with Jason Connery. A great children's story and very nice characters.
