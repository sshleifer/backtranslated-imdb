Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves he is. Already a success by making sophisticated American dramas such as a letter to three women and everything about Eva, as well as the successful adaptation of Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz makes a wonderful job of making this hit Broadway, and it with style. Marlon Brando is perfect like Sky Masterson, even though he can't sing well. He is the only actor to make his perfect coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a great job of acting as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the horse in a very funny little bit. Yet Mankiewicz has to get the most of the credit to bring a fine music on his own right to the screen so that it feels authentic in many screens, but it is still a story in his own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a good musical and works on many levels that it should not normally have.
