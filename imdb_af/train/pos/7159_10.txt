Louis Sachar's compelling children's classic is about like Disney as Freddy Krueger. It has murder, racism, outrage and murderous lizards. <br /> <br /> Plan tightly, it's a multi-layered interlinking story that covers history to reveal Stanley's own heritage and the secret behind the holes. It runs from Latvia's greenery to the pock-marked Camp Green Lake (hint: there is no more and no green). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success is to create the beliefs of the novel so convincingly - the set design is beautiful and without shine. The other plus is in the casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is right and he is far from the ordinary cleaned hero. The rest of the film was equally well-filled, from Patricia Arquette to the boundaries of the border marble bank to Henry Winkler and Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and the sentiment got full volume at the end.
