089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933, seen 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The icicle was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we hit another Busby Berkeley music game from Warner Bros. This time it is the ultra-fast Footlight Parade, with James Cagney, lead producer Chester Kent. I'm 100% sure Cagney Berkeley can channel with his performance of the irreconcilable Kent, who has to get new ideas for action every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongue secretary-spin love affair. The Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell subplot is not that big this time, but not less enjoyable. One thing that surprised me was Berkeley's performances themselves. It was too exaggerated and complex to be performed at any stage, let alone a stage that would then be a movie. It is clear that Busby does not allow a small thing like a story to prevent him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he may be able to confront. I almost enjoyed all of this movie to the end, with the scandalous offensive number, "Shanghai Lil", which guesses, goes over the stomach twist than racist shows. <br /> <br /> COVER: Six movies in three months. Must be a new record. Anyway, it completes Warner Bros. 1933 musical trilogy, preceded by '42nd Street' and '1933 Gold Diggers.' I would definitely recommend watching all three in a row. I wonder if James Cagney Busby was able to channel Berkeley while playing Chester Kent in this movie, or if the role was written by Busby. I hope it was; It seems sensible that Berkeley is the kind of guy who sees extensive dance like everyday in Chester. The funny thing about Cagney was that he didn't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense. He was 5'7 ", square and talking with a strange New York accent. But the man was pretty versatile, of the poisonous gangsters who made him so familiar with the fast-growing types we see here. He could dance. Generally speaking, he was a character in the character of a character actor, with the rest of the role playing well-known faces, Joan Blondell returning and playing the show as Cagney's loyal and amusing secretary, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler playing. Cute couple, but look less screen-like than before, Billy Barty again emerges as the ominous movie, typical of the more up-and-coming, pre-code era, more mature and adult-oriented musicals than those of the 50s and 60s that are more family-oriented was and is an excellent climax of the Warner musicals of that year (the Shanghai Lil number is not resisting, and Keeler does a poor job of searching Chinese.) <br /> <br /> Last movie: Dinner at Eight (1933) Next film: I am and an angel (1933).
