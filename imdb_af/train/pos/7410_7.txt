In a foreign film section of my local video store, I went to "Shower" and passed it several times, as it looks like a farce or comedy from the front page. I was lucky in a copy to buy at an economic price and am happy for my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, a father and two (2) adult boys. Everyone agrees with life changes, as the world around them also changes in modern China. As with many "strange" movies, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fascinating features of the local, Chinese color that gives the backdrop to this story, the difficult daughter-to-be relationships between the men and an only woman involved in the story are. It's all against the backdrop of a townhouse home. <br /> <br /> The family story moves from alienation to understanding and pleased me. these people. At the main story are the many small characters, bathhouse clients and their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a movie that runs away from smile and touched by its warmth and humanity.
