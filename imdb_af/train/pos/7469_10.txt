This movie was just absolutely brilliant. It really made me think. Throughout the movie I was confused in hell. I loved it all ... it was just as confusing and so twisted and strange, it wasn't hard to love it. All the actors were phenomenal, and no one could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites this year ... it deserves an ocar.
