As someone who has never condemned Adam Sandler in terms of talent, such as him and many comic actors as he did, I went in to rule over expecting a good movie, not just because of his presence in the movie, but because I thought it all looked good. Even someone who has already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance, writes here that I was amazed at how great he is in it. He will make you weep, especially in his deliberate sudden and unexpected monologue. What is wonderful about his role is that it is a character that is difficult to say what we have seen before. We have seen many emotionally rare characters, many mentally handicapped people, many loners, many passionate self-centered artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is not one of these. He may taste each of them in any way, but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It is a joy that the audience is drawn emotionally and by everyone whose problems, attitudes and challenges are quite different from most characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle delivers a very different level of performance. He is every man. He is the most normal possible person in the world, so much so that you will find almost many characters, as he is, or at least anyone who plays as he plays Alan Johnson, whose name even appears on the composition. Cheadle is brilliant because he is funny, sly, smart and stupid like so many ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is populated by actors and actresses who have barely done anything in a while in smaller but rather colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the excessively refined upper middle class woman, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge. Robert Klein is Sandler's disgruntled father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder's writing is quite brilliant because it says something pretty deep about the wonders of communication in all its thoughts. It is much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much more near-home ideal. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style. This film struck me as a return to the kitchen-sink style of the 1970s. Cinematography was granular and detached, but it was its charm. It wasn't about attracting us to the camera itself and the shine that its stories would dilute with it. <br /> <br /> The music, which plays an important role in the film and its title, is very powerful. Near the start you feel like you're interested in another. About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine kind of soundtrack, but you soon realize you're more than that. In fact, the film is full of music that stimulates many of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is an important statement not only for society but also for the film itself. It shows that even Blankman's director is capable of doing wonders.
