Castle in the Sky, more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience. This is the kind of movie that makes you feel like a child again; It's just magic. It's a crime it took so long to release it in the states, but now it's here, check it out! And stick to the original language; the dub has slightly changed my impressions of the characters, which should avoid something at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever.) <br /> <br /> I give it a ten / ten.
