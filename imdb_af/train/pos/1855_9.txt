Having not seen all the movies released in 2002, I can't say it's the best movie of the year. I can say that this is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Most American black movie films are either obsessed with American concern with "race relationships" or fall into the stone of the inner ghetto, with every steroid imaginable spitting ebony-formulated snake. Antwone Fisher stands proud in this regard: race is irrelevant, except for one fight that may be used by racial falsification. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher's story is one that must resonate with any empathic individual. He is understated and thoroughly portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while of course using his strength to make the film, remain firmly in the background, leaving the film the Antwone Fisher story. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET, and popular culture in general, the gheticization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians want to know, you also know), this is a movie with humanity. everything speaks. from us. I just hope that the non-black public will see this movie for that humanity, rather than avoid it because they feel there are no characters or actors in the movie they can identify with. It will be a sad comment on racial relations in North America in and of itself. <br /> <br />
