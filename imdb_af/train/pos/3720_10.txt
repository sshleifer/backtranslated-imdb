Joel Schumacher made a big choice when deciding on this role and this script. The story was well written and well set out, and this completely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seems that there were 6 leads and about half a dozen supporting, which is by far the best thing about the movie, the new young faces of tomorrow. It was long ago that Hollywood touched the controversial Vietnam war films, which says something for the "story to be said" (as said by Schumacher) and Tigerland country in those handful of top war movies. Yet, it cannot be marked as a war movie, as it seems to be more based on the human spirit of Bozz and the other. I think anyone who just wants to see a good movie with all the special FX, but just a good, dramatic drama should see Tigerland, obviously Shumachers Best work for the past 8 years.
