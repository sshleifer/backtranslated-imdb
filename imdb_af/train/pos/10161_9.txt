I hired a flyer to rent this movie, but I have to say it was very, very good. On all fronts: disc, film, director, photography and high production values. Prove Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom / com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston. Who is this? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in this class themselves and should try to keep up for projects as good as "Over Her Dead Body." Lake Bell is also excellent, and this is the first time I've seen her. And finally, Paul Rudd is shining in a very good movie, rather than less movies. <br /> <br /> A movie like this never gets its cost from closest men. It's too bad. As other IMDb reviewers have noticed here, there is nothing lame about this jewelry. <br /> <br /> And the depiction of contemporary L.A. and California, in general, makes every scene shining, beautiful, clean and otherwise excellent in every way. Never made a movie L.A. looks so good. Oh, what a little talent and a lot of caring for a movie can do. <br /> <br /> I will not disclose the plot, but as a long-time-and-nuclear atheist I was prepared to suspend unbelief and buy in the supernatural theme for an excellent and light enjoy fun. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This movie is popular but otherwise hackneyed, movies like "Ghost" for the mediocre and too sentimental crap festivals they are. We already know that the public taste is very heavy against the mediocre. Some of us praise our dignity. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed other narrated jewelery such as "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Mister Right" with John Malkovich, etc., You will enjoy. <br /> <br /> A first-rate job everywhere (even if it's a bit hard to believe a straight guy, he can be gay for more than five years.) But even the plot device doesn't detract to the film's overall excellence.
