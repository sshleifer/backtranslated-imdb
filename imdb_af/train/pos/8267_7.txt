Harvard's brown is a hard-to-catch movie. Nowadays, we expect a lot more from our movies, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a little more innocent. William Haines is beautiful like the rogue who must stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the relationships in the movie feel very stylized, except for the homurotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sport ... It is a good education in how society changed in the 20th century.
