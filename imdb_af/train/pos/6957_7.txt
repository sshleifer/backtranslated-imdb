My Super Ex-Girlfriend is no longer an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The story is quiet, simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and hooks with her. In the beginning of their relationship everything looks good, but Matt finds out that she is G-Girl. Initially, it looks really cool to Matt, but it seems that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break with her and join his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and she begins to avenge herself on her former boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I like most in the movie is the screens where G-Girl unleashes herself on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a different role than her character from the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to someone who likes a nice comedy.
