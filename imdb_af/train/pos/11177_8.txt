***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What makes you really scared? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring a message back? Maybe a chain saw that has a psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But those fears do not even compare with an abomination that people dare not even speak or consider - and that is the death of your own child. "Pet Sematary" taps this base, primary adult fear, and take it to places that most can not explore. <br /> <br /> I commented on this movie that includes poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I do not agree. The acting is actually the first time for a movie like this. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the despair of such a scenario. But the film's events are not only logical, they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the real horror of 'Pet Sematary': it is not that pets and people come back from the dead as bad murderers hunting with knives and shells, it is that anyone who has lost a child can become so desperate to commits the crimes Louis Creed does. Despite warning, or even past history. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who are willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector is trying to make sure he can't protect. And the results are terrible. In fact, when the film dives into the abrasive area near the end, it's almost a decrease, although I believe it's quite logical how it came. <br /> <br /> I'm a real horror fan, and I claim it's one of the scariest horror movies ever made. If you don't think so, see it again after you have children.
