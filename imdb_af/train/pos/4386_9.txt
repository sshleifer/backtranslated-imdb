This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accent made it difficult for me to understand much and it ruined the show experience. I gave it up, but then I got the DVD, used the English subtitles when I needed it, and I really came up in this movie, just how good it is. This is excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminds me of Braveheart, a story of good to evil. Here it is Liam Neeson (well) vs Tim Roth (angry). Both are doing their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors come across as despicable as Roth. Man, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant, annoying puzzle. (He is so dirty and dirty, the sick critics love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man's husband and was a solid hero figure like Gibson in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong as the female head. The movie draws you in and becomes quite involved, so willing to view an emotional experience.
