I shot the movie on N.Y. watched television and thought it was a depressing look at the future. Wells considers private freedom restriction a good thing. ("no private aircraft".) The 30-year-old war in the film was the reason why this film was not shown to British filmmakers. The concept of the future and the Korda and Co-concept of the machines of the future are the right stars of the film. The best acting performances are those of Ralph Richardson as the Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous Comedy Series. It is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to Churchill's time of war.
