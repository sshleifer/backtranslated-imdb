let me say that I love Adam Sandler, see how I reign over me, I paid close attention to his acting. <br /> <br /> When he makes his voice heard, I can't help but think of happy gilmore shouting at a golf ball, then I get back as Adam Sandler sucks me in <br /> <br / > Reign over me is a good movie, a movie that is initially delayed, with the expectation of emotion in every scene. Don Cheadle always does a good job and is not an exception here with some very good lines and is an Oscar worthy in any movie he does. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was wonderful in so many ways, it was not just his most dramatic / best film of his career. but I can remember listening aloud to many parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting role was also good with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie of great acting beautiful shots of NYC's great comedy big drama.
