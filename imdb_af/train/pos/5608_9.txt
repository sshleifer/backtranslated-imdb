Certainly, after this film he quickly became uneven, but from "Mes In Water" to "The Tenant" Roman Polanski could always be considered to deliver something fascinating and unique. Despite many running themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films really looked like. The story of this is somewhat similar to its own "repulsion" of ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. "The tenant" is darker than the dark absurdity (I'm a little hesitant to call it humor, though the lead actors were sometimes bizarre behavior and dialogue) with some exciting paranoia. Polanski was always a master to build discomfort, and moments in this movie are almost unbearable. The overall strangeness of the film is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Polanski's beautiful as usual direction, the rest of the role and the crew offer excellent contributions. Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by Polanski, but his performance here uncovers his characters and feels that it is an outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this movie more than just strange, for the sake of strange. The rest of the film also features strong performances, especially Isabelle Adjani's sympathetic turn, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters's fussy annoying kids. The tenant is often underestimated because of how ready people have to praise both "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but it is just as brilliant as one of those classic ones. (9/10)
