This movie is absolutely stunning. A new Blade Runner - future noir on it is the biggest gritty. The vision of Paris is beautiful, both recognizable and visionary, with views of the view, grungy pieces and the futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The story line is pretty simple, with little surprises, but that's not what I like most about the movie. This is a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and delivered in black and white (no grays!) with just one short color space, it's less difficult on the eyes than it sounds. There are many "arty" camera shots - imitations and strange views - but it just adds to the temperament of the movie. Overall, you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was under the impression that the movie was rotoscoped, such as the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. But unlike a Scanner Dark - which suffers from (or even is amplified by) conflicting character definition (just look at how some of the hairs change shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and accurate throughout. When the character is close, details and texture can be seen, but if it is in the middle of the shot or farther away it is omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only side of the movie is that one comment tells us it's a one-off project. Such a shame, because I want to see more of this futuristic film noir storyline, especially in this latest graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English dub is also good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie and highly recommended.
