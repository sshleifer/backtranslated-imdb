Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate, have to deal with their two teenage daughters and strange son. But after the untimely passing of John Ritter, the show was more concerned with the loss of a loved one ... <br /> <br /> I found this show and climbed one of the channels one afternoon and I have to say I laughed at me until my ribs became painful, just on the series of characters; the witty lines and the situation Paul will mostly deal with himself with his daughters. From then on I caught the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say the writing was very good. But then I read about John Ritter's death ... Shortly afterwards I looked into a farewell part 2 and I have to say I'm almost in tears, watching the emotions of the characters, losing a loved one ... How Rory ' a wall in anger and frustration. .. How Cate goes to sleep alone in her bed. Briget and Kerry talk about what they had to do. <br /> <br /> But the performance continues, bringing it along with Jim Egan and CJ Barnes who are giving great laughter, because Cate's father is trying to protect his family and give Rory a man's issue. But the real jewel is CJ ... who's totally hilarious than the wild cousin. <br /> <br /> This will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
