A struggling actor finds the best way to break in Hollywood is to start beating the competition. But what makes Break A Leg a real gem is the sardonic look at the existence of the struggling (and not so) LA actor. It brings us in that world with effortless irony and whiteness. It also has a polished look and very good guidance under Monika Mitchell. Breaking a leg is one of those rare independent films that does not compromise its production value at any level. The writing is strict, the dialogue first rate. Cassini is an actor's actor, and the role shows off his talent. The climatic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an immediate classic, and can be one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it on an advanced display, and everyone in the audience laughed and touched uncontrollably.
