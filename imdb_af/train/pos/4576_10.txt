I thought it was an absolutely beautiful movie about the lives of Mary-Kate and Ashley's characters Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it's just not that easy for them to really do! I thought it was a very charming and sweet movie and if you are a true fan of these wonderful young ladies, I'm sure you'll agree with me! If you haven't seen this movie yet, I say you were really missed; great time, and you definitely have to take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
