This movie received horrible ratings from just about everyone who voted here, but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber, this movie is for you. If you're into movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca ID suck you in a different angle. Still, I still like this movie and everything about it, even though it's kind of kiddy, it's one of the few movies my friends and I could keep and quote in the course of the year. GREAT MOVIE. This movie should have the AFI's number 1 because it's so friggin 'high class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have been having problems because it made a TV movie on a non-existent channel. So I don't know how to get this movie, like buying it for DVD, but I can't find it. I still tied it off when it was the first time, you could come if you wanted to and watch me sleep. these movie rocks and it's basically everything you need to know.
