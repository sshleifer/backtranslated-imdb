"The College Girl Murders" is my first introduction to the writing of Edgar Wallace ?? and generally my first true introduction to "Krimi" movies in general ?? and I can say I'm moderately impressed. These things are really entertaining, though I never expected it to be so? dumb! The movie has an exciting and intricate plot, with a healthy dose of humor, flamboyant twists and pretty inventive murders. There's a kind of James Bond kind of evil mastermind ?? who is always in the shade and in front of a big screen - recruits prisoners to kill some girls at a particular college with a new kind of poison. There is also a villainous monk with a whip, dressed as a communist CCP member, to get rid of the remaining characters, such as excessive, curious teachers and so on, as well as a mad police commissioner who continues to deal with solve a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew earlier that these Crimean films were so colorful and crazy, I'd have bought a whole collection of them. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it eventually answers, and the overload of comic gimmicks on Scotland Yard's Inspector Higgins account is sometimes a bit to swallow, but I don't mind because it was sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60's soundtrack has long been stuck in my head. It's like a variant of the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
