Cult classic is almost impossible to predict. Who can guess Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, movies released by critics and audiences through their release will become incredibly popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a movie expert. In contrast to the majority of those who hated Envy (found by a dishonest 4.4 rating), I found that Envy was one of the funniest movies in the past decade. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is ridiculous. The dialogue is not clever, the screens have little continuity, and the writing seems to have been written by a fourth degree. But that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. You see, to appreciate the unhappy genius of Envy, you must enjoy the movie from an ironic standpoint. <br /> <br /> Why do I like Envy? Because the movie is bad to the point that it gets good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy definitely fits into the account.
