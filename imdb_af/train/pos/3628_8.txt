The film has many fundamental values ​​of family and love. It expressed human emotion and was an inspirational story. The writing was clear (it was very easy to understand that it was perfect for kids) and was sometimes fun and humorous. There were some charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many cinematographers did today (which silence is being honestly warned). It was clearly filmed, but has a good soft quality for it. Although editing could have been done better, I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown to you, something I didn't like, but in everything it was a good movie.
