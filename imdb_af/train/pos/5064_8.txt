This film is wonderful in every way modern action adventures are not. Take a while. Relax, enjoy. Think. People who watch this movie as slow or pillaging or sowing, really need a week off and watch it a few times until their short attention span comes up with the possibility of being involved in a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it is not in a hurry to make the points you so explicitly need in the short time. Initially, I was worried about Brosnan playing a native American. Given the story line though, I think it was appropriate pouring. Now, back to my hermiting. -Jahfre
