I saw it at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who made it) remained a Q&A. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe it was a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel once again risked going out on a limb for a script he'd like have. <br /> <br /> True to Cinema Paradiso's remarks, it tells the story of the young director about the revolution in Cuba. Don't expect it to be a movie about the revolution, it's the political attitude that is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to directors have clear love for film history (a great "Bicycle Thief" tribute) and some wonderful scenes that work with pretentious. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
