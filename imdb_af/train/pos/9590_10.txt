Documentaries begin in 1986 in NYC where black and Spanish dress holds queens "balls". This is where they dress, how they like, support their objects for an audience and are tuned. We teach many members and see how they all hold together and support each other. As one man says to someone else, "You have three strikes against you - you're black, gay and a queen of dragons." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted into society - just at the balls. There they can be who and what they want and accepted. Then the movie cuts three years later (1989) and sees how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressed, but it's not. Most people questioned are actually very funny and get a lot of humor from their situations. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - just as they should. We find that everyone lives in "homes" run by several "mothers" and everyone helps each other out. The sense of community in this movie is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a big hit. It has won the best documentary awards at many festivals - but has never been voted for an Oscar award. Their reason was: "Black and Spanish dress queens are not academic material". Isn't it fascinating? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> From today it is still a good movie - and a period piece. It's just not that way - the NY they show doesn't exist anymore. The balls are still kept, but not in the spirit we see here. Dragging is also more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I heard the houses were gone too. It's kind of sad. I want to know where these characters are now - I know two died of Aids, but I have no idea of ​​the other. And what happened to the 13-year-old and 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> Still, this is one of a kind of documentary - fascinating, funny and sounding. A must see all the way! A certain 10. Where is the DVD ???
