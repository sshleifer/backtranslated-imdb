Anyone interested in pop music, and not familiar with the British music trends of the late seventies, should make sure Breaking Glass is at least once. The film, about a young woman's endeavor to make her mark in the music world, sets the times perfectly, from open sexism, rugged economic times, social upheaval, the shift in pop culture of crude and tumble-pointing to terrific and pretentious Futurism / New Romance. The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late seventies are still being rediscovered and reclaimed (nothing new since 1980). It was a brilliant time, and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and explores the cultural landscape, and it is very good.
