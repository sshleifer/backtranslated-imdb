I saw this movie recently and enjoyed it very much. It gives insight into the movie show in India and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget, but needs a name actor / actress to get people, anyone to see it and expose the movie. Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder makes an excellent combination of eccentric Miachel Bates, a "NAME" factor played by Alan Bates, was a perfect decision in the movie and for the movie. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan played by the beautiful and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her own special show again in the movie in the movie. If you enjoy thinking when you watch a comedy, then this one is for you. Low budget meets lower budget with high lag content.
