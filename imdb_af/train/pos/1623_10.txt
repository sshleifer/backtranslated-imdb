This is a cartoon that should have been won instead of Country Cousin. Visually done well and much more entertaining and memorable. Usually just watch the music alone! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly increase the sensitivity of some of these days, the cartoon needs a little perspective. It's more than sixty years old and it's just a cartoon. I am disabled and if I were as hyper-sensitive as the people who look at this kind of cartoon and take a shot, I have been curled in a fetal position for a long time. Sometimes you have to get lighter, get your head back and drive! Cartoons of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when he was on more than one occasion. * Sigh *
