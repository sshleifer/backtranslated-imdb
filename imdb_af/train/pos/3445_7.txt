First, it was a BRAVE movie. I saw Irreversible and can understand the comparisons. However, I cannot begin to understand the people who deleted this movie. I can see how the end came apart, but I would lie if I didn't say I wanted every man who ever had a wife in sex earn exactly what Jared did. Conversely, it has not solved or improved anything and the fact that the film does not pretend is what I appreciated. <br /> <br /> The commentary for this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would hold. I definitely and thoroughly did. I'm 24 years old. The way the movie goes, made me realistic. People have become so used to seeing sweets and fast-paced displays on the screen, if you ask them to focus on one brick for too long on the basis of a movie, they not only lose interest, they demolish everything that is built and call it junk. When it really is, it's their lack of patience and understanding that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative spirit like Talia Lugacy's. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson showed flawless self-destruction. I think she portrayed Maya with great ease before and after assault and the transition between the two is an act I seldom see well. Often, the effects of rape are often displayed as very manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless, such as the films "aimed at teenagers", mentioned in the previous comment. Dawson, in my opinion, manages the balancing act, so many survivors fall prey: drunken existence in the waking hours, work of a dead end to survive (and derive) and then overfill in vices to themselves lose the fool of substance abuse rather than see what brings austerity. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was telling the truth and I appreciated getting people to see another side of rape. So many people end the end of this movie the middle and the beginning ... I believe Mayan's face was the end of the act ... not the act itself ... not the revenge or its meaning. Just her face ... <br /> <br /> Thanks
