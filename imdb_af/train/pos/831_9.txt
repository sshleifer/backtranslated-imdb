I watched this movie while being under limited release, mainly for the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it seems to be one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It starts almost as a thrill, but is constantly working in a hilarious piece filled with one-liners and great comic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, while I say this movie is a comedy, don't forget it, it sometimes has a heart and can become a lot when needed. When I was in the theater, I didn't know what to expect more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've ever seen. If I leave the theater, I feel a lot of the movie and plan to see it again in wide-ranging release. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well written writing and a big mustache.
