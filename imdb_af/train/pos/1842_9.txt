Series 2 started with a good start! I don't think you should have looked at Series 1 to get a grip on what's happening, but like any series, it's nice to feel the characters and care about what's happening to them. And this show makes you think so! These 4 30-something women seem to live glorious and exciting lives, but the point of departure is credible and realistic. So the twists that come, thanks to their love and sex life, are exciting to watch, but you also know it's a real-life problem. It's about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are leading certain paths in our lives rather than deliberately making those choices!
