The Lion King series is easily crowned in Disney animation. The original Lion King is the largest masterpiece in cell animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is by far the best direct-to-video sequel that Disney, or any other studio, has made for an animated feature. It deserves a theatrical release. The same can be said for this movie. It has the original cast, songs by Elton John, a hilarious story, exciting action and touch of character moments. Everything you expected from this series. Not so much a new story, but fill and elaborate background on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story. What impressed me most was the care taken in the animation. All too often, Disney briefly discusses the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here they seamlessly mix new animation with material from the original movie. The scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly respectively play their role as Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We even get a return visit by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas. There is a lot of laughter in this movie. So if you like Lion King, you need this movie. The story just isn't complete without it.
