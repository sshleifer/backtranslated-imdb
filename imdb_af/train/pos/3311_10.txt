A general plot line in films consists of the main characters who leave the hustle and bustle of the city and find themselves in the tranquility of nature. In the Kangwon province, two stories of individuals are shown, and they are trying to find their way through a journey to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon province. But rather than epiphany moments, we had two characters whose journey to nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The tempo of this movie is slow, contemplative. We finally learn what really brought everyone to the Kangwon province and we learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood glory and for a movie to give them a definite answer, this movie won't satisfy. But for those who want a movie that reminds them, wondering if they are years after, this movie will satisfy that longing.
