I recently watched this movie in Winnipeg - appropriately, given the location used. I first read Lawrence's book in the 70's and for me it was always a very powerful picture of the aging of our society. It resonates when I was young, and it resonates even more now. When the movie came out, I was eager to see if the story could survive. and was thoroughly impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. She manages to give us a complete human being, although the character is generally sharp and discreet - someone with whom you do not want to live. It is wonderful to see how favorite characters come to life in such a way.
