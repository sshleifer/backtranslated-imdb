The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in effect, because it is the sound that a delayed young man makes while operating his imaginary trolley, which is what he does all day. And he's just one of the strange characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunks who sell women, there is a man with aspirations to be an architect, and his young boy he sends to pray for food. There is a wise old man who apparently is the psychological pillar within everything around him, and there is a businessman with serious nerve tics who has a woman who treats him (and everyone else) as dirty. <br /> <There is no specific plot about this, it's really a lot of stories moving back and forth between each other, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all, I thought it worked well, and I died to see it for a long time, just based on its description. I was not in the least disappointed, and I would definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10.
