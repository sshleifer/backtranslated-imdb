This movie has it all. It is a classic portrayal of the events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his fate in America. This filmy, yet extremely accurate depiction of Miami's Drug Empire is amazing. Brian DePalma does a wonderful job directing this picture, so much that the viewer engages in both the storyline and every character in the cast. With Tony's characters' percentage being so credible and strong, Brian DePalma is exposed to the raw talent by Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed watching this movie every minute, and watching it again weekly. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie, I am one true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in this surprising number. With other dramatic crime movies, I find this movie a shock to the system.
