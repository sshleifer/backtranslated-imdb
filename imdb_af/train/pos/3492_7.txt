Not as bad a movie as I thought. <br /> <br /> It has a good role to play. Enjoy watching Roger Moore again on the screen as well as using other British actors. <br /> <br /> Want to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. Perhaps the opposite is her cousin's sexy Maryam D`Abo. <br /> <br /> Also a good use of invisible locations like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> Hopefully, we see more British-European co-productions like this one.
