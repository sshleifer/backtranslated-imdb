"It's all for you, Ed?" "Now you get the game." The day my dad left my mother, he took me to see this movie with his new friend on the opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I wasn't even quite sure what I saw, but I'll never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> See it thirty-six years later, it gives me another look. <br /> <br /> My dad was a great Burt Reynolds fan, hence the reason for almost an hour to watch what an action movie would be. I have previously seen two films at the Dome: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway." Well, it wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. When I left the theater, I was watched. <br /> <br /> But even in that nice age I appreciated the artist ... and after seeing myself again today, I am amazed that I still stand after I have seen it very disturbing, but extremely well-made film. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year old who had to kiss his first friend. I didn't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit for a child to testify. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I find it rather disturbing, but I'm still very impressed with the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like all the principles ... of Billy Redden as the gut guitar, Burt Reynolds is an absolute wonder, to Ronny Cox as the terrible insurance seller ... Everybody does a great job. The sound quality is unmatched, from the chirping birds to the ticking watches. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable movie is the first time. <br /> <br /> The moral questions asked, from the assassination of the sexual assailants to the aftermath of the death of a person, remain as deep today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. And the classic rows that try to survive in the desert after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-changing. These four men, citymen, suddenly faced a situation they never imagined. Guess the bar of action to fear. <br /> <br /> It's a classic to be sure of. And the phrase "you have a nice mouth" is quoted endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to by-the-cuff commentary on water cooler at work, this film is without a doubt a big part of our social plug culture ... as much as "Make my day" or "I'll be back" was ever. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you sexually assaulted your friends on the rifle of mountain men far from your life? In the city, cozy bed, wife and children? And if you took the measures, Burt Reynolds (and I would have done the same) would you bury the body under the gold after lake, or stand up and take your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance. You can bring it to the bank. If this film does not come under your skin, then you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen it before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed fails to kill the deer ... and then to change. Life and its unpredictable circumstances can change a man. And I think that's what this movie is all about Jon Voight, especially as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly understated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor. His acting raises the film to another level. Climb the rocks in twilight, frightened and determined to fix it. It must be seen to be believed. I assure that your heart rate will be increased to a new level. <br /> <br /> Quick, tense, tight and tight as a banjo rope, it's a morality game that asks questions that stay today. The times have changed, but our choices as humans have not. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
