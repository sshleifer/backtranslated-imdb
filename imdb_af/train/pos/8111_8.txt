Things to come are indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both set up the destructive nature of the war and the horrors of progress. It makes some surprisingly accurate depictions of the war that would follow a few years later, but is filthy in the Utopian ideals. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are playing a good role, though the play is more than a play as a movie. There are grandiose or somewhat corrupted speeches, often delivered as if the actor were trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words there. Is technology the savior of man, or the instrument of his destruction? The film is a visual festival, if one can detach him from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely so inventive. For the imaginative, the third action is a surprise: a world of underground cities, massive deco bombers, space guns, gyro-buyers and secret organizations of scientific rescuers. It has everything from a sci-fi pulp adventure, but rather uses the steps for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> Things that came with Metropolis were the hallmarks of the Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operational in scope and visually inspiring. Technology has left them long ago, but their ideas have erupted. There are artworks there, one with more heart and emotion than computer-generated mass projects of today. These films are the products of artisans, not industrial.
