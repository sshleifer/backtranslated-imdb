Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it at least a hundred times and I can't figure it out without crying. I deceive anyone to see the reunification of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and father, and do not feel your eyes become foggy. Whoopie Goldberg should have one for a wonderful depiction. And for the person who said you couldn't love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I am proof of this.
