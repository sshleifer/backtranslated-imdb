In this excellent Twentieth Century Fox movie noir, the metropolis is a maze of despair in which painters and predators survive by living each other. A prostitute cut her wallet on the subway. It contains a microfilm, and a communist spy ring will go to any length to repair it. Two parallel investigations explode as both spies and police find the valuable information. <br /> <br /> Anti-hero bags Skip McCoy is selected by Richard Widmark selected insurance. He knows that the police are his moral and intellectual inferiors, and he takes them: "Go on," he says to Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "trumps a load. Throw me in. You did it before. "In this unrelenting world, police are just one gang on the streets. Just as Candy gets the hooker around Lightning Louie bribe to get a head start, the police are paying stewards for information. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that when Widmark made this movie, he was already in the early middle age. The 39-year-old star, who arrives with Fox at the end of his contract, plays the kick over McCoy with the teenager's unwavering brashness. Today, it cannot be acceptable because the romantic leader wants to strike his love interest in unconsciousness, then revive her in a losing beer in her face, but in the course of time it considered toughness - and Candy is a fallen woman. br /> <br /> Jean Peters is brilliant as Candy. Here, right in the middle of her five-year burst of B-movie, she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart. She is the story's victim, a martyr for her beauty, as much as anything else. She means good, but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men - Joey, Skip and the police. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. Ghostly urban panoramas and cutting metro stations offer a claustrophobic call from the city as a living, malicious force. Like maggots in a rotting cheese, human figures scream through the city's roads. Elevators, subway lanes, sidewalks - even a stupid waiter serves as clues to the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to a niche that offers safety: Tired of her grim rented room. Skip his brown hut on the Hudson River. As the characters move and interact, they are framed by bridge architecture, or grids of orders, or divided by hanging coils. The personality of the city is constantly up to him. The corners and crossbeams of the logs are an echo of the Gridiron street plan, and the map index cabinets in the mirror room imitate the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the metro is excluded, it is as if the city's steel noses are relieving him. <br /> <br /> A surprising part of this movie is shot in close proximity. Character drives the plot as it should, and the close-ups are used to increase character. When Skip Candy interrogates, the close-up closes the sexual energy between them and the hostility of Skip's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted in the light, in beautiful soft focus near-ups. The device is also in service to increase the voltage. The opening sequence, the wallet, does not contain any dialogue. The drama is quite close-up for its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Snoopers, and snoopers on snoopers, populate the movie. Tired (Thelma Ritter) lives as an informant, and her place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by her victims. When Skip is observed, "she must eat", he is a repetitive chorus. Just like 'straight' New Yorkers make lamb chops or wood, the Underworld traffics in the commodity of information. <br /> <br /> And even the chair pigeons are better than Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet on Moe's bed symbolize a violation of the most basic moral code. Joey's past the pale. Moe won't deal with Joey, even to preserve her life: "... even in our crummy business you have to pull the line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "Pick-up" was made in the depths of the Cold War. Richard Nixon has just been chosen as the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate. He made his name with his ominous communist microfilm and Alger Hiss. The McCarthy show trials were a daily reality. We see police in the movie weighing on "the traitors that Stalin gave the A-bomb." <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant container in which human waste cheats, squeals and murders. Containers form a leitmotif throughout the film. Tired, wearing her trademark box of ties, and candy's wallet, holder of the microfilm, is the engine of the plot. Skip holds his only possessions in an underwater crate, symbolizing his mysterious street wisdom. The paupers, moving on the Hudson's boat, are containers of just one charge that are moved around the immeasurable metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown above the villain. Skip the quiet gangway of the loft, indicating her moral rise. When the rifle is placed on the table, the extreme perspective seems to be bigger than Candy - violence starts with dwarf compassion. The lovers are obscured by the shadow of a stevedore, reminding us that their love is not pure or absolute, but is dependent on the whims of the sinister city. Enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall, or an angry look of cigarette smoke. He is like the lonely alley under the garbage - a robbery of the night. Camera shots from under taxis, in newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds, we continually enhance the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis. We are the civilization cover.
