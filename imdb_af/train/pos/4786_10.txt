The Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives over the state line. He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can't ride and he wants to make the frost himself. The film shows his journey beautifully and the lives he encounters on the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a stunning show, just like the rest of the role, especially Sissy Spacek, in an engaging performance as his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> Initially, I felt that a story of an old geezer journey across the countryside would be tired, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all the insights into human life, made it a movie what I would recommend to anyone.
