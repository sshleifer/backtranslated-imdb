The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I loved. I love every one of the shorts they made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also many other great actors and actresses who were many of them in many of the shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stooges is ever one of the greatest actors and is the all-time funniest comedy team! <br /> <br /> It's a good Three Stooges short. It's funny and his film includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. The Stooges did very well in this short! I recommend this one!
