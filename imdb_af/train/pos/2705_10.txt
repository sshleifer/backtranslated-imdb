It's a script that Ed Wood worked for over 10 years when he tried. Aris Iliopulos eventually got the chutzpah to film a screenplay that saved Wood from his burning house at the expense of other, more endearing valuable items. <br /> <br /> It's a dialogue-free movie, which some foolishly describe as silent. In fact, it is a rather noisy movie, without the blatant chatter of the most flashes. In the hands of these filmmakers, the music and sound effects offer a rich sound experience that works better than almost a crust from the Hollywood script mill. In particular, the silly boot movie Billy Zane was last in ('Watch out!', 'Oh no!' - J. Cameron .... not). I will take Zane's wonderful communicative monosyllabic grunts in this movie about an empty dialogue on any day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane holds a team of players who really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods shine as you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy's name on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid sets beautiful, and Ron Perlman's beastly performance is simply wonderful. Overall, it is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly made by fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and cinenephile. A must-have for everyone who really loves movies is the way the first course Iliopulos and his throw do. A movie to make you wish you made it yourself.
