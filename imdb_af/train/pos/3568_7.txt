This film moves the Cinderella story to the early 1950s and makes it good, as eccentric, the use of the Isle of Man as a backdrop. The Ugly Sisters have become a very glamorous English girl in the higher class, and with Kathleen Turner as the stepmother, they have climbed into several wonderful journals. The story changed a bit from the traditional version: earlier it was strangely combined with the plot of "King Lear", and in later stages Cinderella is even more assertive than usual. It looks great and works pretty well, but sometimes goes over the top.
