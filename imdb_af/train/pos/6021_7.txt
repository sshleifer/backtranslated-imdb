Although not necessarily a so-called "classic" movie according to today's standards, it's still worth seeing. The main reason why you are experiencing this movie is that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60's, no matter how good or bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in an English literary class at SUNY Geneseo, and although it's initially just a meaningless compilation of 60's icons, the movie is far from just throwing together. <br /> <br /> My point is that if you leave the movie unsatisfied and confused, the movie has done its job: it is a deserted view of the future that makes you feel insecure and angry. It might have been the same feeling that the movie was trying to explore in the youth. <br /> <br /> As such, "Zabriskie Point" cannot tell a very good (or interesting) story and at the same time its characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, this kind of clich√©, rebellious desire to get out of the life that both Mark and Daria have to share, also contributes so well. Even the anti-settling students are as indifferent as the government they oppose.
