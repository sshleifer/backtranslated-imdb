It is so gratifying to see that one large piece of art is converted to another without distortion or suppression. I didn't guess how such an extraordinary piece of literature can be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book, you would be understandable to see that a misguided interpretation is done more for the sake of an artistic project than bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen. There are a few examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves nothing to be desired. It is as if the filmmaker reads the work of Bulgakov in the same way as an orchestra conductor reads a score - with no notice missing. Why can't we find such talent here in the US? So now my favorite book and movie has the same title.
