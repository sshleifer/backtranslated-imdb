This movie frightened the crap! I have to admit that I kept most of the movie through my fingers, but what I saw was very scary. I shouted aloud two or three during the show. <br /> <br /> Film making my favorite aspects was the sound and photography. The sound was exceptionally good and the environment was very spectacular. I read somewhere that this is a strange man and woman team that made it. For some reason it even makes me stranger. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies if this one is for you! Very exciting and a good movie to rent with a lot of friends who love watching movies curled up on a bank that screams like little girls!
