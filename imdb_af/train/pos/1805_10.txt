I just saw this movie, I only saw it when I was 7 and just remembered the end. So I watched it, 10 minutes ago, and (I may look like a baby like I am 12 ha). I started crying when I forgot how sad it was. I think I was especially sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you Charlie" and also, "I will miss you Charlie," just hah hah made me. It has to be one of my favorite movies, it's just a movie worth watching. WATCH ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I love this movie, it's a true classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
