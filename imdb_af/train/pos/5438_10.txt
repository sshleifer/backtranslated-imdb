An exciting adventure director, George Stevens (before returning to more serious rates such as the 1948s, I remember MAMA and 1956's GIANT) which follows the standard for all future actioners. Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem of the same, GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers in the 19th century India. The noble trio should include a series of battles and other dangers including a blunt cult and a temple full of gold. Their screen adventures continue to thrill even after more than six decades and have made efforts for almost everything from the rocker-inspired space opera STAR WARS (1977) to the similar RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <br /> The biggest reason for the success of the picture is the successive performances by the movie's trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen is rarely better than the tough strong man, Cary Grant is the ultimate cartoon, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is such a waving hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply can't be improved, and such a warm and credible comrade is exactly what is lacking in most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe, who has the obvious Overcome physical crime and make the title character a beacon of human sweetness and silence. A big hit in his day (the film was allegedly the second largest money maker of 1939 behind the far-reaching GONE WITH THE WIND) and probably remains the best film of its kind.
