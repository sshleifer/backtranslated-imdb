Later, Walsh had a private conversation with Jack and told that there was a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer and had assigned Jack to find the conspirators. When a plane exploded over the Mojave desert, Jack has another extra issue to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a successful series featuring Jack Bauer. This is the first time I have watched this show and I admit that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a trusted agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: find a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter, in trouble, trying to save his marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
