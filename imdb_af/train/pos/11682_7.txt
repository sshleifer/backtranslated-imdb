There is a theory of time which indicates that all the moments that ever existed and will exist exist. It's a little too much to turn your head around, but maybe a little comfort to those who want them to go back to a simpler time and place. For Barbara Jean Trenton (Ida Lupino) at that time, twenty-five years earlier, in the mid-1930s, her youth and sheen were the greatest promise. If I could travel over time, it would be back to the 1950's when I was growing up. Maybe to a place like Willoughby, but it's another episode. One thing that wouldn't be so special in 1959 would be dealing with all those bunches of machines just to watch the Twilight Zone episode. . How many roles do you think it will take to catalog the whole series and then find a specific story you wanted to see? I think you should consider the discount, convenience versus simplicity, have it now, or take the time to flush it to the exact place where the story begins. Printing in a CD has benefits. <br /> <br /> I'm a little surprised that Rod Serling will write a story so close to Sunset Boulevard. Ida Lupino's character mirror has made Norma Desmond just a little too late to be regarded as an original concept. Martin Balsam portrayed a similar character to Erich von Stroheim, the man undisputed Butler's loyalty. Where the story deviates, Danny (Balsam) and Sall (Ted de Corsia) have the challenge of getting Barbara Jean with reality and relieving the cobwebs that paralyze her existence. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for our viewers, Ida Lupino did not have such reservations about taking parts that were not big but a nice showcase. It's a great surprise to watch any episode of "The Twilight Zone" and to see who's coming by. Sometimes you get a two-ferment, as you have here with Lupino and Balsam, celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series started, and sometimes afterwards. Combined with the stories the program produced, it is not surprising that they can still entertain so well today.
