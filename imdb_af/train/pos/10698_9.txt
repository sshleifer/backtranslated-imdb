A little funny movie. It is absolutely incredible, incredible, impossible. But it's funny how an introverted masochist can be completely dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows, but who could come in his fantasies. Of course, this is a condemnation of the folly that you can find on the Internet. You should not believe ten percent of what you are told there and never ever accept to tie your hands in one way or another to someone or something you do not know personally. Most of their "businesses" there are somehow misleading you and attacking you. But here the head is the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends with the victim of the crooked business that prevailed and ultimately plays the same game with his victim and wins. One thought is also certain. English Airport security is not exactly what it should be, but I think it's no better anywhere else in the world, and even now they have encouraged all the rules and regulations. It's just nice to go through their procedures and systematically feel them. Then they lose their revenge through your luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and don't expect to get fair compensation. Whether confiscating a bottle recorder or a can opener because it can be dangerous. I can see myself by opening the side of the plane with a can. Funny, isn't it?
