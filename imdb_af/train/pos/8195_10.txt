Sudden Impact is the best of five Dirty Harry movies. They don't get leaner and wiser than it does like Harry skipping through a series of violent clashes, with the bad guys just getting dessert. What is just like I like it. Great story too and very directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
