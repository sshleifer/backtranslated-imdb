Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first movie, was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas I've ever seen when I talk about movies. They had only one landscape, a lot of actors and a plot. So what made it so special was the effective direction, great dialogues and a bizarre condition that characters such as gears had to deal with in a maze. His second movie, "Cypher" (2002), is about his story, but it wasn't as good as "Cube", but here the characters are being tested again like rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo back to its "Cube days". He re-enters the characters in a lot of other space, without any time playing with the characters again like playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a writer sci-fi (even some of the wrong-looking promotional teasers and trailers), nothing is a loose and light comedy that can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we live. Once again, Vicenzo wondered with a good idea in such a small thing. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, that's all you have most of the time and you no longer need. While 'Cube' is a claustrophobic experience and 'Cypher' confused, nothing is quite the opposite, but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This film proves once again that a clever idea means far more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the movie sometimes fails, but its first idea means a lot and offsets any mistakes. There is nothing more to say about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience since the "Cube" in movies.
