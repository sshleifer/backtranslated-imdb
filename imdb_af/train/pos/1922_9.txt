Let me first say that this show was the best when John Ritter was there. At his death, the performance declined a bit, but the producers did not act. James Garner and David Spade contributed from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The showcases Around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son, Rory can (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was at the show, I would scream in laughter (and proud to admit it, I'm), but now that he's gone, I'll just laugh with the occasional hearty laugh. I am delighted that I came to show this show after Ritter's untimely death, as it made the eps with Ritter so much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is just as well behaved and well-rounded, so you can't help loving him. He is always working around the girls about dating, but he really wants them to be happy. This is the ultimate daddy hating boyfriend entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also good, and she is also a nice character. After Ritter's death, her character has such a good influence and power for not only her children, but I believe that Sagal formed the life of Cuoco, Davidson and Spaniards because she and Ritter have long been friends. <br /> <br /> The funniest person on the show will be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: beautiful, slow, dull, but she is a smart person. She is of the wall hilaries with her innocent blond humor and how arrogant she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson may be a bit annoying like Kerry, but that is the purpose of her character. The only flaw in the show is that the show never really gives Kerry a chance to be happy. She's always been to Bridget, and her character feels like it's been thrown in there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers as the only Hennessy boy is hysterical, and when Ritter is at the show, he is mostly comic. At Ritter's death, the show features some story lines for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are nothing but laughter, with the occasional story for C.J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father, as a little background information. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this show a good review, as it is a wonderful event that has a tragic event that made it cripple. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - spy
