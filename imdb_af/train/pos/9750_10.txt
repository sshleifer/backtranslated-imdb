Yes, Giorgio, is a good movie. A little romance, good music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a good fight), and a bit of bittersweet taste are the ingredients of Ja, Giorgio. Any movie buff will enjoy this movie. Those who need massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us occasionally need a little escape, and the better to do, than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? A must see!
