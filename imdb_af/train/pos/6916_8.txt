Winchester '73 was the movie that Mann moved from the b-movies to the big league. James Stewart's deprived post-war career saved him by ruling him as a conflicting hero (although he inherited Fritz Lang's project, perhaps Lang deserves the credit for it). Both men go to much darker places. Mann with the remarkable dark devil's doorway, which stood by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it? but a movie about a man who drives his own brother because the rifle is transferred from person to person along the route before ending in one of the directors' beloved mountains, is even stronger meat than you from the studio expected system. Great dialogue, an impressive supporting role? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them ?? and Mann's excellent visual sense increases the bar with this one.
