Why did it sound like the man called her Appy? It ruined a huge episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential for a movie. <br /> <br /> It was very Hellraiser ripping with all the skin although I don't know how anyone can survive without skin, the skin is an important organ for the body, the biggest organ actually and without us dying . The more a horror movie is true, the more creepy it can be and more entertainment. <br /> <br /> I do admit that the stories of the big horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 come on Yankies get English!
