Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still change the world with their smile. The combined talent of these two amazing stars makes this combination reunion / new movie start working. Watch it and look forward to hitting sixty! Mary defends youth-oriented society with white and charm. A touch drama adds 2000 realism. A summary of the TV series will broaden the new characters and give us the opportunity to see occasional Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
