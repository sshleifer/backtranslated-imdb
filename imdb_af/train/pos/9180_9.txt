I had the duty to watch the Jane Timre 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation, as I just wrote an article on the 2006 Jane Eyre version for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I came closer to see how I would do homework. <br /> <br /> I was initially irritated. The lighting in this version is bad. All / everything is washed out in a bright white cliff light that throws shadows on the wall behind the characters in some scenes. <br /> <br /> And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt I was listening to a high school play. <br /> <br /> And the pancake makeup is far too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets do not completely carry the Gothic mood. of the novel. They are too picky, also Martha Stewart. I can't just see Bronte's Rochester lasting Martha Stewart household arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in gritty gloom, well suited to the novel's Gothic mood. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all the objections ... not only is it the best "Jane Eyre" I This is perhaps the best fit of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Despite his technical flaws, this Jane Jane brought me the feeling of reading Jane. Eyre "for the first time. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say it's too close to the book. For me, someone who appreciated the book and didn't need a lesser "or a less" Christian "or more gender, this version's fidelity to the novel Bronte's actually written is the best asset. <br /> <br /> Bronte wrote a good book. is a reason that it lasted 150 years, while others, slim, healthier and easier texts disappeared. <br /> <br /> For a long time "Jane Eyre", I was biased against Timothy Dalton as Rochester, Rochester is famous, not attractive, Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature, and Timothy Dalton is nothing if not beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives an enchanting performance as Rochester, he just blew me away, I have never seen anything like his fierce commitment to the role, the text, the dialogue and Rochester's love for Ja no. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to the alleged on-screen life. <br /> <br /> Rochester is meant to be a little scary. Dalton is scary. Welles also has the horrible stripe, for example, when he shouts "Enough!" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is more than once here. You really can't know whether he will hurt Jane, or himself, in his despair. <br /> <br /> Rochester's volatility, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability: Dalton disintegrates everything, sometimes seconds. It is beautiful. <br /> <br /> And here's the most important thing: The actor performing Rochester must convey that he spent a decade of his life in despair, lonely, with an ugly life-destroying secret. . <br /> <br /> No other actor I've seen, this part tries to do the black hole of despair like Timothy Dalton. Current fan favorite Toby Stephens doesn't even try. Dalton hit it from the park. If I see Timothy Dalton doing Rochester in a single beam, I would say, "The guy is hard. Don't even look at him." He is so radioactive, with a distressing distress. <br /> <br /> Not only is Zelah Clarke the best Jane I ever saw, she is one of the few Janes that producers were prepared to throw as the book Jane threw. No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, did not describe Bronte * a static, robust Jane with finely curved eyebrows and pouty lips. On the contrary, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is indeed poor, clear, dark and little, and not pretty. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, close eyes and a bit of a nose. She is really "small". She's not a fashion model. And she's the best Jane, the truth of the book. <br /> <br /> Some called her a cold or boring. No, she is true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mama, she is a sheltered, robbed teenager whose inner passions only come out at important moments, as Zelah's do. Jane's book is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, if you really want to kill her depths. You have to look Zelah to know who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more fire in Zelah in one important scene, but it's one five-hour scene in what she is, otherwise, very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, like any other version I've seen, is away from the completely clear Christian themes in Jane Eyre. "Christianity is not accidental subtext in Jane Eyre. It is central. Helen Burns commands Jane in Christianity, and gives her a subversive, cultural way of reading and living, her apparently doomed, pinched life. This is Christianity, and a Christian God convincing the poor, plain, Jane concealing her equal worth, her need to satisfy her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal, not made quite clear here . <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation, of all that I saw, mine and honors The novel is the best of any adaptation what I have seen, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not fully respect the book, are being played in many ways, if you don't mind what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture that looks like and money land is not, your adaptation of much of the book will be something that moves people forward to come to the son of Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote - about Jane's experiences at Lowood, and her relationship with St John - is part of what Jane's relationship with Rochester makes. as explosive and memorable as it is.
