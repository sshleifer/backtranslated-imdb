They may have skipped from the beginning - I don't know why it starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If that was because they started in the Mediterranean, they could begin closer to modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of the cameras and teams comes to the Bakhtyari tribe, this is the start of a wonderful 48-day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this incredible trek across what seems to be a very fast Karun river. They use floats that are held leg by blowing goats - you can see where the head and legs are removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep. I recommend a 60 degree turnout. <br /> <br /> It was just incredible, but there was much more to come. To get to the pastures, they also had to cross a large mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. To climb this mountain was in itself wonderful, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The one drawback of this documentary was the inter-titles with poor attempts at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary of the silent era, or the incredible challenges that this tribe does not only face, but overcome. It's just an amazing document from a small, well-known group of people who have all kinds of challenges.
