Have you ever wished you could escape or work your dull and stressful life at school and go on your own magical adventure, with one of your closest friends on your side, with all sorts of dangers and villains, and unravel the mystery of a lost civilization just waiting for someone to discover all his secrets? Even if you're not that much of a fantasy lover, have you ever wished you could just experience what it was like to be a kid again and not care for a few hours in the world? <br /> <br /> That's exactly what Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" is about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives on a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls from the air like an angel and takes him on a journey to ' a place far beyond the clouds. All the time their pirates and military units were warming up on their route. Simply put, it's just the amazing adventure every kid dreams of at some point and I can't help but feel my worries melt every time I see it. <br /> <br /> As one of Miyazaki's older works and takes up a lot in the everyday world, the film is not as visually stunning or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke no. Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these movies is better than the other, because all three of the films are at one point or another mystical to the point of being mysterious, if not confusing, especially to the latest of viewers. . <br /> <br /> "Castle in the air", on the other hand, doesn't try to be an allegory of any kind, nor is it a lifetime story; instead, it is probably one of the best portrayals of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective of the children's eyes is just wonderful; whether it's clearing the "camera" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height to look off the ground or the ocean, while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but feel like I am there at Pazu and Sheeta, just a child in another world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves do not have a complex relationship that indicates a need for hope such as Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, who one day literally fell from the sky, the absolutely perfect person for him, from the beginning. As the film progresses, more and more of their real adventurous childhood comes through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they a worshiping memory of who I have been, but their engaging friendship never leaves the whole movie, but just grows stronger into the last frame. For that reason, I fell in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Castle in the Sky is such an easily accessible movie. Because it doesn't matter what kind of accidental movie movie you may be, you'll be sure to find your solution here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, tension, sci-fi, romance, even western ... it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies (except perhaps horror). That's why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki movie. It is perfect for those who do not have expectations of the incredible other worldliness of some of its more recent works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, when translated into English, carries the feeling of longing for the discovery of a kind of lost civilization and a kind of soul mate that could not be found in our everyday lives no. "The reason I long for the light is that you are in one of them. The earth turns, wears you, we both wear that will surely meet." Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make finite songs from Joe Hiasashi's beautiful scores, but it's the only one I've seen, both of which are a loving song and an inspirational dream. I found myself near tears and just listened to it. <br /> <br /> "Sky in the air" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular or meaningful work, but it is absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be. : A true vision of children's fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for any adult who wishes they can have the same wonderful imagination if they just have little children. Sit back, relax and love what it is.
