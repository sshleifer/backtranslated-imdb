I admit I saw only three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet) from which I got the other, Macbeth and Hamlet, I just found a masterpiece. I'm happy to tell you that this adaptation is just as good as the intense and dramatic game. The play is extremely strong. With a role that Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal have, how can you lose?) And the change in duration (looks like somewhere between the 17th and the 1800s) plays beautifully as the characters move. and say their infamous lines straight from the writing itself that any fan of the Shakespeare game will get chills. If you are in this popular drama, I highly recommend watching this powerful 1996 adaptation of Shakespeare admirer Kenneth Branagh.
