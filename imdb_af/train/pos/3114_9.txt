I'm going to keep it pretty short to spoil anything for you. This movie is great. From start to finish, it is filled with true excitement. The fighting scenes are fantastic, the rushed scenes are alluring and moving so fast that it only feels slow at the end when things are explained, but that's just because everything has preceded. Damon shines and has really proved a very solid actor, daring not to believe in this role. He's this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (I spelled it as close to the right) as a cunning CIA agent to kill Bourne. It does not stop and will leave you most of the way on the edge of your seat. Some things at the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, so ignore a 10 rating. The end is open to prosecutions and I hope they are of the opinion that more of this is because no one was bad. Excellent movie all and a fantastic end to a wonderful trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The shaky camera didn't do any of the action, but I still think we can do it without doing it. The good news is, you just see it when people talk and not so much the action.
