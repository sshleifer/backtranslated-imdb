More a picture of the most popular pinup of all time as your typical drawn-out biopsy, this fun and fabulous movie has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you want in an indie-type movie. I think the tendency would be to portray Bettie Page as a kind of sex vixen, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you looked carefully at Betty's attitudes, she always looked happy. Not a "you wish you could get with me" look haughty, or the "I just do it because my scene hasn't worked out" look of a pornstar. And so did the ladies involved in this movie (three female producers, a female writer / director, female co-author and the beautiful Gretchen Mol, who I certainly helped to shape this role with her own pure influence). idea of ​​a lovely, somewhat naive, southern girl who really enjoyed taking her picture and hoped good ol JC would not be upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol seems to be a career achievement (she may just have the best breasts ever), for which I am happy because she had the curse. A few years ago she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was, and named her the next IT girl. And let's face it, it was a little suspicious. Unfortunately, I mean she never made it to Gwyneth status, though it was not a lack of talent. Making some poor movie choices when you're a pretty blonde in capricious Hollywood makes you forgetful. I am scared. If it doesn't put her back on the A list, I'll be the uncle of the monkey. <br /> <br /> Very private, Bettie hasn't seen the movie herself yet. Bettie left the pin-up party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever your boat drives. You were one hell woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Mary Harron, you've done our cult idol justice.
