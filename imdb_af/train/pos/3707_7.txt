I found myself at sixs and sevens while watching this one. Altman's zoom in and out touch was there, and I expected the devices to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, they were sometimes free, sometimes spiritual, often barren because they didn't point out ironic or other connections. In particular, two seams of the gilded dome in Savannah just confused. To be honest, however, a few zooms (outs and ins) after Branagh increased his character's increasing confusion, a la Pudgy McCabe's or Philip Marlow's. Generally, the zoom was good, inconsistent, and sometimes even relative. <br /> <br /> Other Almanean devices, such as multiple camera and subject glass windows, have succeeded in suggesting characters to diphtheria or narcissism or opaque. standards of knowledge. Motor cruises, house windows and other screens were used effectively and reasonably consistently, I felt, rushed back to the PLAYER and even the LONG GOODBY. A few catchy cuts, especially for a suggestive TV commercial, have reminded me of such use in SHORT CUTS, to sardonic effect. <br /> <br /> But lastly, the mismatch between Altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the Grisham genre momentum didn't make me excited. The masterpieces of the 1970 director reviewed and deconstructed several classical genres, including the Chandler detective film, which seemed in some ways. this time, the director had too few arrows in his analytical sleeve to hit any meaningful blow on the soft belly of this animal genre. Maybe he was by Mr. Or am I missing something, because of my poor knowledge of the genre he is doing here? <br /> <br /> However, the casting was excellent: Tom Berenger (for his terrifying pasture), Branagh for his) Hubris, Robert Downey Jr's pheromonal haze, Robert Duvall's method of waste, and Davidtz's lurking femme deaths were close to perfect choices. And apart from a few glides from Georgia to Chicago (brunette?) Daryl Hannah, accents were convincingly southern. <br /> <br /> Suspension and mood were exuberant, even though the story didn't sound. viewers. The flexibility of a coastal-before-hurricane barometric dive was excellent, effortless. I felt like screaming at the caller to switch on the nut cooler pronto. <br /> <br /> In the end I have a 7. <br /> <br />
