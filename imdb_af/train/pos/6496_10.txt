Example of how to make World War II documentation, using first-hand accounts of real troops and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict, and archival material collected from anywhere. I did it on a repeat on the history channel over a year and a half back, with no knowledge of World War II at the time, but it embraced me and now I consider myself a buffalo from World War II , and watch and read everything I can find about it, but nothing comes close to this monumental documentary, it is definitely worth buying the boxing ............. <br /> <br /> It's simply documentary making the very highest standard.
