Gorgeous with a wonderful show by Gretchen Moll that includes such smooth smoothness in her work and the relaxation of the little movies and the photos are perfect and often hilaries. According to Harron, they are using non-manufactured film supplies and fifty-style studio lighting even for the outside office to give the color portions its distinctive look. Bettie Page has the movie at Hugh Heffner's house (she is now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not the director, if it was uncomfortable if she didn't like it. She apparently did so until the official investigation, which she upset. Also good costumes. The idea for the movie started in 1993, but it was worth the wait. The portrait of her never looks fake about all the images and extracts of (terrible) movies many of us have already seen. It would make an interesting companion with Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more enjoyable!
