A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a sharp portrayal of a deeply divided country (for further evidence, look at the comments on IMDb ...!). Very favorably compared to Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is mainly an in-depth investigation of Fidel Castro's nasal cavity). I don't know if Chavez is everything he presents himself or in the long line of populist Latin American caudillos. I also don't know if he will be able to make good the good expectations he has built up among the poorest Venezuelans. It's hardly reasonable to expect a movie like this to answer such questions - but I definitely have a good idea of ​​what is at stake and what it feels like to be caught in the midst of a coup. Someone says in the movie "we make history", and that's exactly what the film feels is fixed. Outstanding things.
