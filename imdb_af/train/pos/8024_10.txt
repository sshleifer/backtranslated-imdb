When I first saw this movie in the 1980s, I was in my mid-teens and somewhat hesitant to see them as I grew up and out of the Sesame Street / Muppets age. I honestly don't remember whether I kept it at that time or not. But somewhere in college I watched this movie again and it ran (and remains) in my personal Best Movies Ever Collection. <br /> <br /> This movie is loaded with humor that was far beyond the expectation of the Muppets. I mean, the Muppets have always made an appeal to adults and children because there is humor for both sexes. But come on ... Janice accidentally heard someone say, "I don't take my clothes out of anyone, even if it's artistic". There is a joke of a father to a boy that if the boy is in love with Kermit the frog then the father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo beats a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp? ) and then said, "I think we are now engaged" ... this and many other moments in the movie made me roll. Add to the very clever dialogue, a very clever New York / Broadway "beckon" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some very enjoyable songs that do not border on "kid-level cheesy" ... this movie is a masterpiece! I don't regularly throw "10", but this one deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film is completely up, maybe even more. The Muppets were never and will never be again, so funny and clever and just as brilliant as this film was and is. --- Q
