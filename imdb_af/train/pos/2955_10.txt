There is a certain allure I have always found in the discovery of the large (semi) unknown film. These discoveries are almost always dramatic films - in my experience unknown science, action and horror are unknown for many, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on video at a junk shop, mixed between dozens of tapes of varying quality. Of course, that's the only place I will find, because it's not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> While I was Judy Davis (like Lillie) during this movie, I was somehow sure I was a great undiscovered show. Yes, I have seen Davis before in several small parts - and one leading role in "A Passage to India". But, although she was excellent in the film, "High Tide" is another animal altogether. Since recently watching Gillian Armstrong's later film, Charlotte Gray, I was well aware of the kind of actress who impressed her. Davis draws much more than a comparative deal with Cate Blanchett - both in terms of sensibility. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis' performance is stunning, I can't say enough about it. She shares an incredible screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), the movie's other great actress. There is a lot of drama and quiet humanity that they share together, the details of which I will not accept to reveal here (see for yourself!). There is too much good in "High Tide" to cover in one review. Indeed, I will hardly care - the movie speaks well enough for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise author Laura Jones for her beautiful dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong, for her understanding of actors and great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, underestimated filmmaking (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
