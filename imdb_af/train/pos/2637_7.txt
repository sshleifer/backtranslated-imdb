It's a straight-to-video movie, so it should be without the first Lion King to compete, but it said it was straightforward. <br /> <br /> My kids loved it, but it's a given, they love anything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that I liked it too, it was funny on some parts (even the joke jokes), had quite some creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even jokes you had to do were older to understand (But without getting up like Shrek ["do you think he's compensated for something?"). <br /> <br /> A special note about the jokes, I was surprised to find that none of The jokes were just toilet sounds (actually there were almost no sounds / images, the references were actually quite subtle), they actually had an essay / punchline / etc, and was almost in good taste. I would like my kids to think that there is more humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is great in those greetings. <br /> <br /> What else? The music was so-so, not as creative as the first or second movie, but great fun for the kids. No painful stingy moments, which was a blessing to me. A little action but nothing too scary (the secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was suitable for that one ...) <br /> <br /> All in all , I would say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that is 100% safe to watch (I try not to be sensitive, but I had to get up and switch off the TV during " few movies that were less child-friendly than expected) - but you are safe to leave the room during this one. I want to say, but you may also find that you enjoy it too :)
