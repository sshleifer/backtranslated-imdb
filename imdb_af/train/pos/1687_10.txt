There are very few hilarious movies on science fiction, but this one will turn you off sox. The lead of Martian's Jack Nicholson start is side division. The plot has a very clever twist that is seen to be enjoyed. It is a movie with heart and excellent acting by everyone. Make some popcorn and enjoy a good evening.
