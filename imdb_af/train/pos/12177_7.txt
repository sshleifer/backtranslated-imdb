Summary: The morning after his baccalaureus party, Paul is woken up by his mother-in-law and discovers that a woman is sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, it's a bar waitress, not his fiancee. And suddenly she came everywhere ... the toll booth at the freeway and at his father-in-law dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend followed and photographed him. It's not just about saving his wedding. It's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comment: Actually, much better than expected. Not the lovely romantic comedy I expected, but something more fun, something with a little edge. This movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further. And Jason Lee is now doing comedy, especially if his character is half panicked and deep in trouble, as he is here. And he got good support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a good deal than the former. <br /> <br /> So, more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> 7/10
