Since I am not nearly a fan of almost a "Desperate Living" John Waters movie, I became warm to "Pecker". After coming out of the ground, Waters produced trash lite versions of his earlier works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray ") that watched and tasted the hard-fans like dried liqueur." Pecker ", who is not an attempt to restore early successes, is a light, silent, humble remark about the vagueness of the well-known world and the pretentiousness of the art world. Waters know it well because he also has (at ridiculous prices ) Most amateur pop art ever created, you can't imagine anyone can give it away if it's not the Waters name, but Edward Furlong is fine as "Pecker" and Waters non-histrionic style is comfortable with the subject.
