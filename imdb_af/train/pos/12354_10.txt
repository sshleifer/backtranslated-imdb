A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors, such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes are locked up on the screen and you do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the movie waiting for the fate for the characters. This movie lets you hear your position as a standard, it takes you in, it makes you part of the story ... Costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the district of the okiyas was built skillfully. This is definitely not a lot of Akira Kurosawa, but it still gets a lot from the master, especially the stylistic story that tells us we are in a premier cinema, which is far from Hollywood flamboyance.
