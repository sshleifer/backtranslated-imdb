but it is worth watching for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainment images filmed during the war also need to transplant to the American shores, such as This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles where they don't fit. Bacall fits the part here. I was waiting for her to whistle and bring Bogie to life; her tone is simply wrong for a top Englishman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people don't talk like that, except in books, but Greene sends a message about an England that needs to raise the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's range of characters is kept intact. While Mr. Mukerjee looked more than a Brahamin, at least his nationality was preserved, and his last conversation with Paxinou was invaluable.
