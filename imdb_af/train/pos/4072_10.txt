Hayao Miyazaki's name has become prominent with Spitied Away, but what is often overlooked is directors' first filming efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas aimed at THX 1138? I remember remembering fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 80's and stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a famous store for Â£ 9, I couldn't resist it, but bought it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie don't match my memory (memory is funny that way). <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie with all the knowledge artists get from the portfolios is how much like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud is part of the artwork. I can only influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's over-anticipated section of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne, this is a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final part with heroes on Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the bulk of my memory - the "pastoral" ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. It is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the view of the Laputa surface, as opposed to the mechanized underground. <br /> <br /> Though this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending to the garden and animals. The end of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It's incredibly stylish, I won't say "smooth" - very beautiful and organic and a huge amount of detail in the buildings, airships and design and look of everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.
