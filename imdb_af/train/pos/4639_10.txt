I had this one a few weeks ago and love it! It is modern, light but filled with true complexities of life. These are questions and answers, just like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite with Jossi & Jagger. These photos are much more, universal, than just the bubbles we can live into. You don't have to be Jewish or Gay to enjoy it - I'm not, but the movie goes straight to my top ten movies. Initially it looks like pure entertainment, but it makes you think further. Relationships that we need to live on are superficial, meaningful, deep, deadly, you call it. You do not know what is coming, and you certainly do not know where this story is going when you first see it. It's worth seeing several times. Fox movies feature great bonus material - here is a good music video and 'making' (including explanation of the title, interview with Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the film and Arabs with uncertainty about Israeli lifestyles).
