`Mad Dog 'Earle is back, with his sad moll Marie, and that capricious Clubfoot Velma. So are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the scenic comets Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason to remember Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without reconsidering a line or frame, and with talent striking a rung or two in the doctrine of the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on.) The only change is that this time, instead of black and white, it's in Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who will consider it an improvement. <br /> <br /> I killed a thousand times, can be unnecessary? and inferior ?? but it is not a travesty; The story still works on its own solid terms. Earle (Palance), fresh from the pen near Chicago, drives west to a great job by battered queen Lon Chaney, Jr. knock over a post mountain resort. On the way, he almost collides with a Oakies family when he is beaten with their granddaughter; The slaughter holds even when he discovers that she is paralyzed. When he got to the huts where the rest of the gang was stabbed, he found amateur hotheads at each other's throat as well as Winters, throwing herself on him (like the pooch). Providing time until they get a call from their inside at the hotel, Palance (for winter's chagrin) offers an operation to heal the girl's deformity, a gesture that returns. Then the surgical strike is against the resort in a bloodbath. On the lamb, Palance moves higher in the cold Sierras .... <br /> <br /> It is an absorbing, enough story, accomplished well, featuring the distinctive Walsh and his role in 1941, the year of Bogie, with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, has become a star. And one last, heretical note: The mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
