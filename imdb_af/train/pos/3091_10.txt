This show is absolutely worth watching. It has the best talent I've seen for a long time. The performance of the show is unique and fresh (I think ABC executives aren't being used as it wasn't another reality program). However, this show was credible with nice characters and wonderful story lines. I'm probably not in the age group they expect from the show, as I am in my 40's, but many of my friends also loved it (late 30's - mid 40's) and died for quality shows with talented members. I don't think this show is enough time to get an audience. I believe it gave more time to do this show very well. Again, ABC does not give a real potential representation a real chance. With so many shows, the chance has been given to chance and not worth it! They should give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and get an audience. I loved the characters very much and look forward to every episode. I watched the episodes on ABC videos and the show is getting better and better. Although I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if it's possible to save this exhibition. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. DRAW THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC BY: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
