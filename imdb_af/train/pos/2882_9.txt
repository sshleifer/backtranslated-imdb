Cinderella was one of the first movies I've ever seen, and for me it's timeless. It's a beautiful movie, with beautiful animation. My favorite animation scene was the dressing scene. I just love those mice. The songs are also nice, not as good as Snow White's, but they are a pleasure to sing and remind Tchaikovsky. A dream is a wish and so is love? is standouts. The characters are also a joy. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief. The step sister was also well done, as well as Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother best, she was really angry, compared to a great character in the name of the Fairy-Godmother. It is true, the movie pulls slightly, with the mice of the mice, but they were really funny, so I don't care. I don't think it's overestimated, underestimated, don't you mean? It rarely plays on television, but the bad successor is regularly done at Cinemagic. If you want a good Cinderella adjustment, try the amazing Ever After, or the cute Slipper and the Rose, who aren't that good. But all you do is avoid the successor, which I have the wrong to own, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
