"Written on the Wind" is a Douglas Sirk's melodrama. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by the Cahiers du Cinema, Fassbinder, etc. Who regarded him as master director. I think it's because of the sophisticated cinematography - "Written on the Wind" offers great color pictures and beautiful decorations. . But I ask myself: Is it enough to carry a movie? The play in "Written on the Wind" ranges from poor to fair (except Robert Stack - he is convincing as the poor and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually a powerful screen presence, is overlooked in this movie. Dorothy Malone as the seducer, the carefree "femme fatale" is OK, but she does not have the strength for the role. Rock Hudson is effective but quick. <br /> <br /> The plot has many interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A stiff patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son, Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /> <br / > his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a female princess, formerly a secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets outside the door, a love triangle, frustration, fist battles, laughter, death, etc. - Well, when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was in for a treat. My mistake! Why? I'll try to explain: "Written on the Wind" takes himself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I have said, it is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors do just an effective job. I think maybe with the Italian or Spanish actors these plays would be completely explored - they would end in a blast of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What the remains of us are the beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk. For me this is not enough. If you want a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
