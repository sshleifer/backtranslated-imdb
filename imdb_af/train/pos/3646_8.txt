Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league pich, who has made one of the most wonderful returns in sports history. He ended an almost 10 year retirement and made his Major League debut in 1999. 35. <br /> <br /> The movie summarizes Morris's childhood, which includes a series of repositories - his father was a military man. And even when his family was good at football in Texas, Morris's passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then jumps about 23 years before the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is said that he has tried a career as a baseball player, but does not work out. <br /> <br /> Morris's team struggles and gives them lectures on how to give their dreams. They turn the table on him and tell him to try out a Major League team. On several occasions when he comes to them in practice, they are amazed at the speed with which he throws. Morris doesn't seem to be convinced, but agrees to make an agreement with his players. If they win a district, he will try to make a Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins district and meets its end of the deal. , Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an excellent speed even for a Major League jug. After another test with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Slips. <br /> <br /> It makes it a difficult decision to stay in his comfortable life or once again to follow his Major League dream by going through the small league to make small money and months on a Spend time away from home. And the decision is even more painful than during his first minor league, as he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs with the Devil Slips start at the AA level and move quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season excites, the chances of being called up are getting smaller. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I like this movie. There are many good performances and nice characters, and it's easy to get yourself into Morris. Also, the film does a great job depicting professional baseball on both main and minor levels. And, above all, it teaches the timeless message to hold onto your dreams, even when it looks like it is far away and is almost impossible to reach. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has errors. While it's generally accurate, it exaggerates and even makes a few things. See http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But for Disney's left wing fervor, it's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, there have been many exaggerations / factories to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20-minute documentary on Morris included on the DVD is information that makes his story more dramatic, but excluded from the movie. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth to his Texas family for good. When he was 12, Morris settled again 14 times. And his initial minor career career ended after four operations whereby he lost half of the muscle in his left (shoulder) shoulder, making his 98km / h inexplicable. <br /> <br /> To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it is good not only to watch "The Rookie", but to watch the DVD's documentary, look at the above link to the film's inaccuracies and probably also Morris's biography, also titled "The Rookie", read. I didn't read the book, but I hope one day. <br /> <br /> But overall, "The Rookie" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the victory of the common man. 8/10
