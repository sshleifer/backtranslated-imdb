With the amount of actors they work on, they cast a wide variety of casts. Beautiful star ship CGI in places, but their green screen needs work. Anyone heard of Adobe After Effects 7, they have to buy it, get their keystrokes. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, lots of traction elements in this to keep it in the right context. BUT BUT the idea of ​​two kissing guys makes me wind before the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can't help finding men who entertain kisses (no matter women). Anyway ... For a fan series it's good stuff. With a slight improvement in their green screen, brushing on acting and a few lead ratings this range is stunning. Anyway, I recommend this series to anyone who ever enjoyed TNG and DS9.
