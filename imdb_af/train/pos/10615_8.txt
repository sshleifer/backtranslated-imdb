The invisible is in a style more like old Hollywood secrets than a horror program. The movie is somewhat slow, but many bizarre images keep the film alive and look. The basic idea of ​​young girls caught up in something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the movie worth watching. The movie is striking for its emotional impact and certainly not for explicit action or special effects. I gave it an 8 out of 10.
