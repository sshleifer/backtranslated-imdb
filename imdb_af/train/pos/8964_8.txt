With a lucky coincidence the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak Alfred Hitchcock's ghostly masterpiece Vertigo made, they also made this light comedy. Perhaps the two actors should do this after undergoing the Hitchcock movie. Anyway, it's a great companion to "Vertigo" as it explores a very unlikely yet powerful novels. In fact, the movie can be seen as the back of the Vertigo, with its happy ending. Here, Novak undergoes a transformation, in Vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she transforms from witch to death. Stewart is once again enchanted and tormented for a while by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two come together in 'Bell Book and Candle', a perfect antidote to the Hitcock movie. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are explored, but in a completely different vein. The cast is great. Lemmon hilarious like Novak's brother and Elsa Lancaster, giving a classic show as aunt. Ernie Kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course Hermoine Gingold who plays Novak's rival, are all good. The scene with Stewart drinking the drink is comedy at its best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you do not have to see this memorable light comedy.
