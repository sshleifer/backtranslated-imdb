A must see movie for anyone who ever went to the camp or wanted to. This movie captures the absolute essence of what the summer camp is about. It's funny, it's compassionate. This makes you want to see more about the characters once the credits start playing. If you haven't seen this movie .. what are you doing? Get out of your butt and run the video store. Have a good summer :)
