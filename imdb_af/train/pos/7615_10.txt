This show is without a doubt one of the biggest shows ever on television. I mean the acting is great, the tension, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: an airplane crashed on an island. The characters are good and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox shows us how a good actor he is, Josh Holloway is so big, Jorge Garcia is Hilarious, I can continue. Also, the unexpected plot turns, the back stories of the characters, the music at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is. I mean it's better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Whoever does not look at this show should definitely consider getting the DVDs and watching them, because they miss something good. This show may be the best show in television history!
