I really enjoyed this movie. It managed to do something that few movies do now; It gave family values ​​while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to track. The little girls I went through enjoyed the movie and talked about Nancy as we walked out of the theater. The movie has relatively few problems for families and I don't think parents will be bored to sit in the theater. No, it won't win an Oscar and it didn't show wonderful special effects or even a horrible ghostly mystery, but it entertained me and it was true for the books' spirit. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone with a young girl (she will love it!) Or any fan of the books. You won't be disappointed.
