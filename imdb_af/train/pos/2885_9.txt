When it comes to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one who made you cry most. poor Cinderella is a girl who has stolen her whole life by 2 evil and ugly step-sisters and a slave-rich stepmother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we showed a Cinderella in animation. <br /> <br /> Before the story begins, Cinderella and her dad are lonely and rich beyond their needs. To share his wealth and to give his daughter a few sisters, Cinderella's Dad married a woman, but died shortly afterwards. the stepmother, just saw dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her beautiful stepdaughter, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> For many days, Cinderella is a slave to her stepmother and her step-sister. She did hope, however, thanks to her friends, the house's mice (sounds like Cinderella doesn't play with a full cover.) She hopes she'll one day find her prince. The chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girl. <br /> <br /> 9/10
