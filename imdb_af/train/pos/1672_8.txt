The Scorpio's tail is a highly attractive giallo arranged by Sergio Martino. It looks like it's a Giallo master second, just for Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fantastic what-dunnit, rather complex, but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. It also makes sense in the end, a big plus, because it is not always the case for these gialos, as they tend to expand credibility with their endless red herring and ultimate solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. Successful giant brands here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music party, the beautiful females (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloved killers and explicit sex scenes to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most parts, it's been done properly, Goerge Hilton is usually his own and others do pretty well. Martino regulates with a certain hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some fantastic pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan, you should see it. Keeping well-written and exciting thrillers in general is highly recommended.
