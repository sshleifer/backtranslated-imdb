Nina Foch gives a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun, gothic nail bitter. She accepted a post as a secretary for a London community defender (played by Dame May Witty, furious) and her creepy sun (the light and difficult George Macready). Before she knows it, she awakens herself in a coastal man she has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call her Marian and try to convince the servants and nearby townspeople she is Macready's crazy wife. Of course, these couples can only plan deadly deeds, and although we know that Julia must eventually escape her fall, director Joseph Lewis is really upset in answering the question of how she will manage it. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to distinguish it from any number of movies that came out at the same time, but I was amazed at how well it held together despite its shoe -string budget and B-movie. There are quite a few moments that can only have you on the edge of your seat, and I really got myself away from Julia while she was trapped in the scheme under her feet and her seizures began to pollute. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have swollen, shouted and threatened and waited for her hero to come and save her. So I can't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this movie, use her brain and find out how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
