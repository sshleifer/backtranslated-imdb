Pierce Brosnan threw out his last Martini and returned, in an outrageous self-esteem, as the aging, filthy killer Julian Noble, who has a special love for teenage girls, bullfights and sticky clothes. During a work in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a suburban Denver suburban businessman, who is in town to make his living in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's coarse and invisible remarks, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Largely worn by the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he didn't mind the movie with Pierce Brosnan, but I can't imagine it without him. He proves that he has a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene in which the two meet at a shiny hotel bar (beautiful sets and beautifully photographed) is really a bravura piece of acting. The scene lasts about fifteen minutes, and although it's probably carefully written, the two actors are largely improvised, but they are doing great! It almost feels like a new standard in screen work. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS, improvise and add one of the most subtle foundations of many genre clich√©s and the actors' own typing (especially James Bros. James Bros.), and you have one of the finest games in the past Hollywood. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story wears out for a while. After an hour, the film just goes out of steam. Nevertheless, and I can't close my finger exactly to it, I really enjoyed it. It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and a few tips to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters are not given much, but this film offers something new. In this respect, it almost effortlessly blends all conventional genres into an entertaining spoof. Very amusing. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
