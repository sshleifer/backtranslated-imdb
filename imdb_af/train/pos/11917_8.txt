Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. The end when the whole crowd got up in the stadium and the people raised their hands gave me a cold when I saw it. It's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad child who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and angels is funny and exciting. A very nice family movie with - I recognize - a rather happy ending. But hey, it doesn't matter, the movie retains its basic quality through the good acting and the inspirational themes.
