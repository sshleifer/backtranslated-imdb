Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a beautiful teenager with a beautiful personality and a very admired singing voice. This 1937 was her first major movie, and it was a cash bonanza for besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS deal with three daughters of a divorced couple rushing to their long-unseen father when they still show their faithful mother that he can commemorate quickly - with the firm intention of undermining his gold-engraved friend and returning to their mother. Although the story is a little, the script is brilliant and the expert cast plays it with a neat screw-ball touch. Durbin has a pleasant voice and attractive personality, and such enjoyable character actors such as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson, and Mischa Auer make the cast. An ultra-light entertainment for fans of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
