I read the book and I have to say that this movie remains true to form. I think it's the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supportive actor as the neighboring neighbor. I saw this movie at least twice and I think I'm going to buy the book and the movie for my collection. The tension just keeps on the climate, the twist you will never see. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, the Sentinel will be a classic foreplay. Also interesting are the actors in the movie. You won't recognize them if you haven't read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is big like the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is underestimated, but big.
