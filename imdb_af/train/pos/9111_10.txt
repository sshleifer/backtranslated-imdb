"Capitães de Abril" is a very good one. The story is not a documentary version of the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But this gives us an idea of ​​what it was like. The fiction of the story is not important, but it does not waste the movie. Captain Salgueiro Maia's heroic actions are not exaggerated and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 Revolution. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played great. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Don't miss it! I love this movie a lot.
