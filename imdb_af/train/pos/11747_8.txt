A good effort for an Australian show. This is probably not surprising as there is a bit of a revival in quality Aussie drama. Dare I compare this show with the glory of love my way? no. but it reminds us of the early secret life of us. The movie is good, Gibney works her magic in the first two episodes I've seen. The British role is strong, especially the Callum and Lizzie characters. but maybe it will be economical (not that it is necessary to save) if this show is going to get another season. I was not a fan of his show in the awesomely awesome time-out mini-series a few years back, but he was big like hall in always greener. It's also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. We hope the performance continues to improve with each episode.
