The photography of this bid-budget production is surprisingly bad. Colors are muddy and brownish and photography has a lot to do with it. Direction and editing are often very uninspired as well as TV movies. * And * for the first time, the movie just seems to torture its viewers with light images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also a typical simple and sheer work of this over-estimated, unmatched composer. <br /> <br /> But if you're willing to watch the movie, you'll be rewarded with a very moving family story, a kind of European version of Edna Ferber's family epic Giant. While initially wondering why Clara married this idiotic man, even his character becomes more deep and more background one can judge him. Clara delivers the film's spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement set against the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose loved one is a young Antonio Banderas at the start of his international career, understands the lesson and eventually tries to live through it. The way the plot was built with the end of the mirror of the beginning was wonderful. The actors also do a good job. I wondered, "Who is the actress playing Blanca?" All the time, but of course it was a very young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie really made me read the book.
