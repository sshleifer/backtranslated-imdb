I hired dominoes, didn't even know it was inspired by a real story, and although it's the least likely and true biopsy, you'll probably see. I found it to be quite awesome. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly he writes a whole series of characters and narratives in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once, you get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model-driven bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to follow a not so subtle or perfect career. It has an edgy acid travel style set by director Tony Scott. And with fast music and editing, it offers the visual flare to keep your attention, with slack performances and unexpected comedy. The movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and entertain the same time for 2 hours.
