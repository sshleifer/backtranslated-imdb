There are so many things to do in Aro Tolbukhin. And la mente del asesino (Within the killer's thoughts), it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in the cinema, but really well done. It's made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 millimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin it's like a movie that made a documentary or viceversa, which is the most peculiar aspect of the doubt that makes you wonder, did he really ever exist? The movie follows the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious missionary work and then killed some people. An act for which he was sentenced and sentenced to death. The movie starts because some French documentaries are interested in this character, so they question him before his death. Nowadays, some more people have become involved and made a deeper investigation of the character. The one we witnessed from the movie. <br /> <br /> For the forefront of history we are led by a semi-slow phase to look within Aro's mind, primarily to decipher why he did what he did. Nonetheless, the important thing is that the filmmakers never give us a one-sided view; they left the judgment for all of us and even if we understand his actions, we can never justify them. So, the first half is based on information retrieval; Later, things change in Aro's childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new strength (even getting hard or never getting bored). <br /> <br /> I don't mean and don't want to spoil anything; So the only thing to say is that if you find the movie near you, believe me, the journey to see is more than worthy.
