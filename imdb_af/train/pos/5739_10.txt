Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and dedication. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky), a gently disabled young man who, 12 minutes younger, twin brother, Liotta, who plays Eugene, through a medical school. It is in Baltimore and deals with issues of sibling rivalry, the unbreakable bond of twins, child abuse and good, which always overcomes evil. It is fascinating and filled with laughter and tears.
