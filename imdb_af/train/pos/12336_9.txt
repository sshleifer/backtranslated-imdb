An excellent time killing melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive flower type, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland reportedly rejected. That's good, because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, who wrote to Hitchcock in the thirties and later also wrote the excellent writing for the classic British horror film Night of the Demon. The opening scene, where Ivy visits a sinister fortune player, played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (James Whale's celebrity writer), is a tour de force, and the film is interested in many sinister operations. I hope to watch this movie on DVD, but desperate for it to happen because it seems to be an undeserved obscure movie. Luckily I saw it at AMC about seven or eight years ago, but I haven't seen it yet. Catch it if you can!
