This Chinese film made me feel so many similarities to members of a culture that I do not belong to and far from me. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps to relate to every character, and to the joy of doing simple routine things. <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu delivers kindness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and common. There, Min, the delayed brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes to and from the most diverse people in this universe. Another China, it is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You won't be disappointed.
