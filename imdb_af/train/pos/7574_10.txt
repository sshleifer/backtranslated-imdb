This is one of the best of the series, with the rankings Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (Or Biohazard: Last Escape). The game has a very good story in which you as Claire Redfield play in the quest for her brother Chris Redfield (Who you probably know from the original Resident Evil) is as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many more cutting styles. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** from ***** Stars (Rating based on comparison with other video games)
