Unfortunately, this movie is not the distribution or attention it deserves, due to the tendency of the American viewer to hide captions. His subtle themes of possession, identity, race relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties, the obviously dramatic tension, the nostalgic memories of the protagonists 'childhood, and the exotic relationship of her parents' "house buoy". "true" man she knows. We won't even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I gave you enough of a hook to take it in, whether you speak French or like subtitles or not. I challenge you to be as brave, strong and aware as La P'tite.
