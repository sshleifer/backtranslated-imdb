Great entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some turn and lots of action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as the hard sheriff and Railsback as "redneck villain". I must recommend this movie to every action adventure lover! 10/10
