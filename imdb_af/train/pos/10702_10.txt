Of what critics and audiences have indicated, the DOG DAY was a big fat clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It was pretty worthy to watch. Sure, it's not your basic American comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change of all the other movies, a fresh air. Sure, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. First, Kidman was fantastic in a lot of others, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy. She just asserts that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effectively, but there are times when she has long conversations in Russian and if you did not know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford had noted in "K-19." Overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.
