I can't tell you how much I like this movie. I read reviews that say this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in dry concrete". I say these judges have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you've ever loved Dungeons & Dragons, this movie is for you, especially if you've climbed into Eastern adventures. I'm sorry I didn't see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen for :-)
