I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised and exclaimed myself. This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from her" - or even the "Bucket List", but handles the entire aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really hard to have the main character as unlikely as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has hard sides and she is not at all a hot and intimate woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets it without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) was taken by her son and daughter-in-law to a nursing home. She figures it out and out and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She's in common. She is busy and selfish. She's a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little. <br /> <br /> In the course of the movie we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunia, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses formed her character ... I began to see the angel ... and I started holding her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the cage. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's definitely a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard sides in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother-in-law or neighbor ... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. That somehow makes me feel more like watching The Stone Angel.
