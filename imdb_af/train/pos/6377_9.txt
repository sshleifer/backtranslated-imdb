Atlantis is probably the best Disney movie I've seen for years. It has a great action scene, magic, an intelligent and weeping written writing. Atlantis brings back the magic of the Disney Classics like "The Lion King" or "Alladin". After seeing this one, I'm sure this year's summer season will be great. <br /> <br /> I recommend to everyone, Alantis: The Lost Empire is like an inspiration. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
