Small SPOILERS warning !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say this myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name Deran Serafian usually means bad news. Most of his films are among the average action movies such as Death Warrant and Gunmen. It was one of his first films and perhaps he had to continue making horror movies instead of acting. This movie really fascinated me. Good performance, as no known actors or big budget was involved. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafic raises another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains loyal and truthful to the truth. This explains the life of Romanian Count Dracula and how he frightened the Turkish army by killing dead bodies in front of his castle. Of course, this is where reality and the "true story" stop. The blood was drinking and everything was invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the US and leads many women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give it to him. Overall, well-behaved by unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and it was on the darkest shelf at my local video store. But it is definitely worth the dust on the front cover and put it in the VCR. Heck, it's much better than the well-known Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame that movie for the attention of this beautiful picture. Check it out ... my humble opinion to die for = 8.5 / 10
