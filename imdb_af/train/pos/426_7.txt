After a lazy Friday afternoon walking across this movie on the Fox movie channel, I can't think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday night, and then worth my two cents. Especially if you consider the lack of user comments on it. Not every movie, good or bad, earns more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when you see a movie like April Love is to remember the era from which it came, in this case the late fifties. Films were quite a happy medium. The theaters had no tragedy, while the screens were filled with wide screen Technicolor movies to scare people from the gray gloss of the evil medium into a box called television. I don't know how many people from the boob tube have been stimulated to see this one, but it caught my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Against Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with his aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) after testing set to steal a car. His aunt and uncle seem to have lost their own son (Jed Jr.) so Uncle Jed seems to have lost his life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick will bring Jed out of his doldrums somehow. Story lines like this are what they are, Jed and Nick don't really care too much for each other. Jed then continues with the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately Jed developed a loved one on Fran, and of course I shouldn't tell you that Liz is developing a loved one on Jed. Then there is the case of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter that has become wild. He won't allow anyone to handle him since Jed Jr's death. You can fill in everything that happens from that point on. no real surprises. It doesn't matter, you'll enjoy yourself anyway. <br /> <br /> Once you come across the image of squeaky clean Pat Boone, as a bad boy, you'll have no trouble with the rest of the movie. Considering that, Boone turns into a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Certainly, the role does not require much depth, but it is still a nice job when you least expect it. As Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. In the early voyage he was unattainable and cold, but when he got up slowly on Nick, we saw he was really a good guy. Jeannette Nolan is very much fun as Henrietta, who constantly plays the part of mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and gets some opportunities to honor us with her singing talent. As Liz, she is beautiful to look at, enjoy listening and sometimes funny. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit more wild, is equally entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there isn't a real common character of any kind on the screen. . Not a real villain in the whole thing. Everyone is as sweet as you can't help but enjoy the movie. I find it frankly refreshing, such as putting your problems behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and wide screen Technicolor. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really liked is that they do not fall back on the use of blue screen backgrounds during horse racing, and they are quite more entertaining and exciting through it. In fact, you will find the whole picture beautifully photographed, and it was nice to see that they did not grind in that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed as every attempt to respect the other. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with a big movie. Still, instead of going to Disneyland, you just need a fun outing in the park, and that's what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B + <br /> <br />
