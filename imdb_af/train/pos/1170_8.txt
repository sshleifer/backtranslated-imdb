Night of The Living Homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film (and the 2004 remake) of "Dawn Of The Dead". Just this time ... at the homeless. The episode has homeless people who all come to South Park and the people. can't figure out why. They treat the homeless as zombies who want to change and some parents end up on the roof of a supermarket as in the movie. So now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them. It's a pretty funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love". Generally a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
