Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once, five years ago, the world was busy with The Matrix, and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds who still believed that Terminator was better than Array. I was just a simple teenager looking for a good action movie, and then there was a bright light on a TV station I never really watched, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie with Jackie Chan - 'Police Story' would appear later. To be fifteen, and just seeing "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour," I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sit down to watch it, and constantly shouted "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progressed has. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the 'Police Story' trilogy, I knew I found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong police who devastates a great drug lover, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is detained by police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things are going bad - really bad - when Chu's case is dismissed and he decides he wants to kill Fong and Chan. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the best action movies ever, and definitely one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies. It starts out strong, ending with one of the most amazing action series ever filmed. Everything in between is wonderful. Some of the funny parts may seem a bit tasteless for more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, it's still one of Jackie's better efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the scene-intensive 'New Police Story'. These are not "miracles", but maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. That made me accessible to Jackie Chan movies, and should offer a good start to any potential Jackie fans. The bad news for everyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies don't get much better - 10/10
