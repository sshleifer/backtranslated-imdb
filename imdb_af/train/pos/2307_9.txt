I must say this movie is truly wonderful and heart-warming. Reese Witherspoon is so beautiful and Jason London is not that bad either! It's so nice that Dani falls in love and it breaks my heart and warms my heart at the same time and watches the court fall in love with Maureen. but it's even sweeter to see how much he cares about Dani. I have to admit although I wanted him to finally fall for Dani. it is just as cute to watch her fall for him. I didn't want her to have broken her heart so badly. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen has taken place in this movie. to see him die, made me cry for a whole day. I just couldn't believe it. But never a more loving relationship was shown in a movie than Maureen and Dani. they can really make it through anything. I give this movie a 9 because I don't want the court to die, but it was one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen.
