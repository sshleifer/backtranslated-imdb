In this documentary we meet Roger, the rich manager of a factory in China who sells beads and other trinkets and sells at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but interviewing four of them tells a different story. The girls' dark lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre remains of Mardi Gras himself. Filmmaker David Redmon has been commended for gaining excellent and rare footage of everyday life in a Chinese factory association, and for landing a revealing camera interview with the head of the US-based company that sells and sells beads. The film is compellingly told and serves its purpose as a window behind those ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
