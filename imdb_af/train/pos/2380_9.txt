I didn't even think about it. People really went to it. It lent an air of authenticity to this period and some perspective on the technology of the Martians. I was also disappointed with the consequences, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this movie enough because she is true to Wells's story! It's about time. The actors are nice and the performances are beautiful. This movie is also worth seeing just to hear Jamie Hall's really good musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor playing both the writer and his brother in London.
