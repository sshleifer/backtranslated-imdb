Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> Skisophrenia explores the world with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is an exasperated writer, killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop nothing to destroy those standing between him and madness. Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck, Harry started his killer. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Atkins is the first installment of the wilderness story ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I saw in this way will be the 2nd installment entitled to Schizophrenic Necromaniac <br /> <br /> It's a very low budget film and won't be for everyone but if you are looking for something that is disturbing, different and terrible, it will make a good choice. <br /> <br /> DON'T EXPECT ANY LIKE MODERN DAY HORROR (Like Scream) <br /> <br /> Viewer discretion is advised
