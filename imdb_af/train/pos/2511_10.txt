I have been looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it out. I didn't expect much from everything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? Not possible for so much talent to live in one person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The story line and characters are not lost in the typical hip-up Hollywood special effects. The story picks up your emotions and pulls you together. As the credits pass, you suddenly realize you've been glued to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the play looks a bit overhead. However, I believe it was done with comedic intent and very appropriate to the character. Otherwise, I would not have expected the level of acting evidence. <br /> <br /> It's worth more than seeing. I find myself laughing hysterically or laughing unexpectedly about something I or the first or two missed or forgot about. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. Feel free to enter into your doubts, but I'm sure it will find a place on your shelf.
