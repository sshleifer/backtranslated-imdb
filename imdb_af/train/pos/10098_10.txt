Dominion Tank Police is without a doubt, one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) mostly consists of action and fun, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated exactly the same as the first part. The subtleties are truly beyond this world and the characterization is beyond brilliance. You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the complexities of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I did complain. In the first part, the Tank Bonaparte literally jumps over a tank cap and it doesn't make sense at all. One can also see the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of the Helicopter Gunship, even if it is cool. Buaku rules.
