It's not a big movie. The acting is not great (some sub-charters are even played badly), The movie is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this one is not for you. but it has a great - VERY GREAT plus on the story. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we didn't ask for on a date, the test we failed, the friend we dropped, is all in our history. This movie works because it touches it. It's a wonderful story because it's a small one. This is the life we ​​all have, with regret we all have, and yet the message touches: every life we ​​could have lived would have had its disadvantage. The first time I looked at it, I was 15. It was shown at a party in my school. 16 years later I think about it every time and every time I see it, it is a smile on my face. Beware. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
