I have just read the main comment for this film, which appears on the cover page with the vote results and the run-off. <br /> <br /> That's why some people can't take a movie for what it's supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a light heart, cheek in the cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for adults, and that's exactly what this movie does. /> <br /> I laughed my nuts on this movie, I thought Carey had a good performance and the whole movie (when looked at Christmas) really gives you a fierce courage. <br /> <br /> So for all of you, movie result holders are trying to sound like movie students and beat every movie because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take movies for what they suppose is to be fun !!
