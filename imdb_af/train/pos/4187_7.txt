This is a pretty good example of film noir. The institution is the early 50s with the Communists trying to steal armies from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is the suave bag without screws. He gives a nice decent performance, but there is nothing A-Lys about him. The interesting thing was that he was not just an anti-hero, but most of the film, an indifferent anti-hero. It's not very normal. Jean Peters has such a good performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. The big-character actress Thelma Ritter shines like the chair pigeon. <br /> <br /> The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wrecks and loud talks. There is a battle scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) which was beautiful and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this movie. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a bit dated and the whole Commie thing is a little exaggerated.
