My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We looked at it a few times and it was the best. Too bad It's a new Pok√©mon didn't speak this time. I'll get used to it. <br /> <br /> Iron Masked Marauder was well-meant when he caught Celebi with his Darkball. Good thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the finite credits, called Cele-BRATE, performed by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever has been a success since the three previous movies and people will always love that movie.
