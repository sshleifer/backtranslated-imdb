CB4 was terrible, but Cundieff could have given the idea better. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is clever from the start. Surprise someone who saw it in the mid-1990s. The performances are played for laughter, but not so much, that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are really and slightly diverse. They respond to situations like any of us. Well, we shouldn't throw a tantrum if our performance hats are too late, or can favor and beat a record company, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (met) H (hats) takes himself seriously enough to roll you in, then you are addicted. Rent or get it at all costs, even if you are not really into rap music, it will still make you run. Compared to CB4 is to compare George Lucas's Star Wars with Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers. I think you see my point
