It is a brilliant British comedy film and one that I could see over and over without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role and it is no exception, especially with his dry white but very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been a fan of me since he was in 'Streets of San Francisco'. I believe Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie, but it seems to be improper for everything she tries to do, but in truth it is turned on, especially at the end when she tells everyone she has invested so much money that she discovered his clothes during laundering. One thing I do, though, can someone please tell me why I can't buy it on DVD or VHS format in the UK, can someone please help?
