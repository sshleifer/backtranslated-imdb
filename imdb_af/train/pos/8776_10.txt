Just one thing about Mr. To name Jim. I agree with all the assessments it makes under Errol Flynn's biggest outings in a career outing. I would think this role playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his true personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as. Flynn was like a party from his memoirs and was one man whose real life was more exciting than his screens alive. The extra thing I wanted to point out is the great montages, transitions, and still inserts that distinguish the film. Although director Raoul Walsh, a regular colleague of Flynn, with the film Sid Hickox, the montages were made by an upcoming editor, Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel had gone so far back, but he was listed right in the credits. He himself would have a good career as an action director.
