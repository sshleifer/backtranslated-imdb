As an adult, I really enjoyed this one. I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun and the animation is great. This successor does what Back to Neverland did not achieve. A good follow-up to the Cinderella story; but what about Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!
