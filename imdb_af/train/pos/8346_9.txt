I just watched Q tonight and forgot how much I like this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and makes you feel that everything is right with the world. I like the merger of Mozart all throughout the opening with Einstein who played Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, on the violin for Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ test of the Ed Walters. I love the fact that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, a particularly unique situation for the 1950s, the time this movie is set. (I was a teacher myself, but stayed at home to wake up my children. Please don't think I'm a brave woman's boyfriend.) It is wonderful how a man who is just fat is finally seen so important and dignified as Catherine's fianc√©, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message for me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many small gags and one-liners that are almost thrown away when you don't look and listen. <br /> <br /> I caught a few things in the movie not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters speaks during the symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging right from the limestone edge. In the next camera shot there is only 2. In the credits on our video it is Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti, as he introduces him in the movie and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. This may be a bit of fluff in some estimates, but it has much more substance than it does for credit. Not only that, what a great roll-away is being put together here. Watch it and enjoy!
