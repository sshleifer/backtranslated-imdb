I didn't know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but loved it absolutely. It was dark, dramatic and gripping. It also feels very authentic, I felt I was transported back to the 1800's. I have never been much of a Heath Ledger fan, but only saw him in teenage movies, but he is very compelling in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing how a highly enthusiastic boy became Australia's most notorious killer. Naomi Watts is big in a supporting role as Kelly's community lover. Highly recommended - and it's from an Aussie!
