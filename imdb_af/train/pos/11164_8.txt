In Brooklyn a century ago, rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competitive firefighters led to Brodie's famous bet that he could jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be known to many by a 1949 Bugs Bunny spoof, Bowery Bugs. <br /> <br /> This generally very enjoyable movie will probably be more available than not for the notorious and disturbing scene in which Chinese residents resided - a timepiece of antediluvian racial events, which I think the film gives a lot of historical interest.
