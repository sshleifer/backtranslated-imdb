Girlfight is a story about a troubled teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Princess is burdened by her mother's suicide and a sexist father who lives in a sexist community. A short mood and lots of things to spark a fire sniff out of school to fight. Her brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), is in boxing with Hector (Jaime Tirelli). Princess is told by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to pay those weeks for Tiny's training. As Diana walks through the gym, she realizes it's what she wants to do. She wants boxing. Princess asks her father for money to train, but he refuses to grind a girl and do more "girly" things. All Diana wants to be treated like any other man. Not watched because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, pure 'effing' genius. Recommend anyone who needs a good clean movie with no 'monkey business'.
