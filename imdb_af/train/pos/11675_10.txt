I always follow the Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' DVD home, I couldn't wait to see it! Of course, we saw the race broadcasting when the race was on the right track, but it never gave the background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you watched Long Way Round, you won't be surprised by the language I find more honest than offensive is more amusing. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he silenced it before Dakar so my feminine need for cleanliness was tackled; tho 'I could have been accustomed without the' flame 'under the fun. As with LWR, the preparation was just as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand and gained every leaf he had during the training .... and of course Andy Caldicott's death. It was a terrible tragedy, but there was something every year. <br /> <br /> Russ drives my nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative synika he had in LWR. It's great to see him as well now with Charlie. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was: 1. Never allow Scorpio to prepare your vehicle for anything! - They had months to prepare for the X5, and still the day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion only did half of the things that had to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the race . 2. The Dakar organizers need to put much more work into their rider / manager recovery plan. Matt (and presumably a large number of other riders / drivers to dry out as they did, was nothing short of punishable negligence; 3. Charlie has an impressive enthusiasm for "rough and difficult" adventure, but has to gain a lot of really do as he likes, and finally 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these, the Long Way Down in 2007, and I can't wait to get hold of my hands!: D If you love For bikes and / or really nice blocks, a twist, you should see it, I guarantee you love it. It's very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, to Simon Pavey - you sir is a hero, I was so impressed with your 'quiet achiever' way and the fact that you were actually finished ..... just considering what a monumental difficult race it is, and for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team "Full points to pull it off. To think that a relatively green team has achieved so much, is truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
