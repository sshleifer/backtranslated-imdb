This remarkable movie can be summed up very easily. First, while comparisons with Princess Bride are inevitable, it's almost useless to do so. Although both films combine mature humor and humor with a fairy tale background, "Stardust" is so much different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of the genres, but the plot and the writing are so unique that, along with the performances, special effects, cinematography and score, they simply aren't anything comparable to anything ever on the silver screen. Second, the score is very effective at pushing us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story together, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement needed to make the magic credible within the kingdom where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the movie even to be difficult or confusing in some way. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main subplots made it even more compelling to look at. Wonderfully thrown, and performed wonderfully on the plate. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since the return of the king (not that I didn't compare the two at all). OK, so it's not that easy to summarize, but don't let any rough and / or heartless and cynical review or the movie's pathetic PR prevent you from having the best time you can have in the movie this summer ( or even possible in a long time)!
