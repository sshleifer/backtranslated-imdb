These slasher photos are beyond their sales by date, but this one is fun. <br /> <br /> The valentine cards themselves are greasy, and well thought out. <br /> <br /> The movie has one peach of a line ... "He's not an Angel ...." if he's actually Angel !!! Watching Buffy Reruns will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The role-play is a brilliant performance of young talent, but the story doesn't give them enough depth. Denise Richards on the DVD extras looked as if the girls were tied to a good band, and that would give you the feeling that you were in common with their characters. Sorry, but no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, showing very little real gore, and relying on your imagination, implied threat. Many can also be said for the similar way in which Miss. Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main line lies in the "borrowing" of several other ideas from previous bracts. Halloween's "masking" <br /> <br /> Killing someone who is hiding in a body bag is a very original one as far as I know !!! <br /> <br /> Light look, not much scary, but some good jumping moments, if it was a choice between The Hole and that, choose The Hole, Slasher movies had their day, and it's just another treasure, good shooter but nothing pioneering !!!
