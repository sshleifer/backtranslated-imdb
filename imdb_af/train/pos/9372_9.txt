Red Rock West is one of those rare movies that will keep you guessing what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is wrong for a contract killer as he enters a job-seeking village. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and nobody plays them better. Search for a short look by country star star Dwight Yoakam. This is the most drama drama, but there are a few lighter moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
