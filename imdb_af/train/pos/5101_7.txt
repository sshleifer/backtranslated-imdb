John Travolta, the world's premier world class, and a mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for! Yes, you probably won't get many surprises or deep meaning in this one. Still, I found it quite pleasant to watch this redhead romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the problems you can expect to have a hardcore redneck pair. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bullying, and of course - the necessary brawls. It has a good 1980 soundtrack, with "Looking for love in all the wrong places", "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break your cowboy boots and keep a boogie in the lap! <br /> <br /> *** (From 4)
