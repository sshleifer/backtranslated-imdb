The Woman In Swart was a British made for TV movie first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eva '89, and again in '92. I believe it made a round on American TV on A&E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90's, but was out of print. A US company released it later on DVD, but the version also sold out. According to the author's website, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and will not be released again and unofficial bootleg on ebay will be sold. <br /> <br /> I only heard about this movie on a message board and had to watch it. I got a copy on ebay for about $ 28. This is certainly a fake for a seller in the Far East, although the DVD says, "Made in Canada," ha. But it's a good copy, and you can't really blame the bootleg labels for releasing things that are rare, out of print, and in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a period set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and spicy British institutions of that time. The black woman is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very low-key but effective and scary. There is no special dedicated gore, violence or much in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely cold moments. This is a chilling classic style ghost movie. The movie itself seemed to be made in the 1930s, except for the color. Without all the flash of all modern horror movies, I'm afraid this movie will always be just a lost gem. For me, it puts him as one of my all-time favorites.
