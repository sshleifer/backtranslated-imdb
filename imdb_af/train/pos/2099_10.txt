It's wonderful - acting wonderful, sets, clothes, music - but mostly the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised there are no more reviews of this movie - definitely one of the best of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> It's also a great movie to watch with the big "Random Harvest", which has a very similar opening crisis. <br /> <br /> - a middle-aged, unknown English WWI officer is in a hospital after the end of the war, suffers from shock and complete memory without any idea of ​​his name, origin or wherever he belongs - he proving that he is a very wealthy man - when he "recovers" will not remember the years before the war <br /> <br /> But there are the movie equations ending. <br /> <br /> My warmest thanks to everyone who participated in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (who's a great deciding choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This one will stay with you forever.
