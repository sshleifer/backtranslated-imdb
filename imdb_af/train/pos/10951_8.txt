Big S doesn't play with taboo or force an agenda like, says Mencia or Chapelle (though I both love them). She explains the obvious in subtle, near subliminal remarks. Her performance won't change the world, nor is it necessary. But with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-friend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show" boasting, it's a mean show with an appetite for destruction! My side was thoroughly destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, such as "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on quick-hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. This one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny leg (and did not lose it in their most recent lipo-suction or boobjob).
