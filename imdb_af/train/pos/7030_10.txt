We programmed it when it was broadcast on TV in 1995 and waited for its release for many years, as it quickly became one of our family friends. The kids are now teens and should have seen it a ba-zillion times, but they still see it religiously with friends. It's reached timeless appeal across all age groups - similar to "Grease." Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander beautiful and wonderful light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him top ratings. (We loved his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) provided us with comic lighting and wonderful music numbers. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was Chynna Philip's performance of Kim. Part of it has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. As a result, Philip's delivery is flat, unattractive, incredible and just awful. The director had seen it and rectified it. Or never throw her to start with. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, the picture is great and I highly recommend it to families of all ages.
