<br /> <br /> ** The house that has dropped blood is one of the better anthology films of the period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Detecting a missing movie director, Inspector Holloway (John Bennett) finds that the last reported observation in a large mansion in the countryside was . As he looked through the house, he was told about four different stories about former residents of the house. <br /> <br /> The Good Story (s): Murder Method - Moving Into the Mysterious Manor to Get Peace And Quiet While Charles's Latest Masterpiece, Horror Novelist Charles Hillyer, (Denholm Elliott) and Her wife Alice (Joanna Dunham) is excited about the story, which is around a serial strangler called Dominicus. After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, Charles began to believe that creation came to life and haunted him and his wife. Probably one of the better entries in the movie, it's easily the creepiest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are really creepy, the riddle around him is really effective and there is always a classic creep moment. The classic moment is death in the psychiatrist's office, which is high for creepiness for a long time. Building it, with the creaking noises, quick flashes of a mysterious creature, and the thunder and lightning in the background, works well for this one's favor. <br /> <br /> Sweets for the sweet movement in a new home, widower John Reid, (Christopher Lee) hire former teacher Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) for his young daughter Jane, (Chloe Franks) as he leaves is. Ann began to unravel a dark secret of Jane's past, which John vehemently denied. When she learns the true nature of what has happened, it is much more shocking that she might have thought. With the creepiest authentic plot and the biggest turn of the story, it's a very enjoyable entry. The secret of the family is played wonderfully, with small amounts of clues piled here and there, and the last revelation is straight nerve spot. The part alone is the main reason why this one works, and Lee doesn't do it either. <br /> <br /> The bad story (s): Waxwork tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend, Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland), both have an image of Conquering a woman in a laundry museum, as the statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum they both visit. There is a smart prospect here, and it offers an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which is always unpleasant. This is no exception, and it seems enigmatic, which is helped by the flourishing lighting displayed on the paintings. A dream sequence offers a good moment of tension, but eventually killing this one is the slow pace. It takes a long time for the events to unfold, and most of the time is spent on exposition. It also builds up to a shock that ends a mile away. These people lower this one slightly. If the turn had changed, it would have been higher, the rest is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Cloak veteran horror movie actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) is upset about the lack of realism on the set of his new movie, goes down and buys a new specialty shop vampire. The cloak will soon turn into a vampire, love the set with co-star Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampire acts at home. Fearless the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove that it is only in his imagination. It has a fairly decent prospect, and there are many opportunities for some decent scares, but what is sinking is several factors. First, it's just too good for his own good. The plot's turn at the end is a perfect example, which is so exaggerated that it is not really a shock and just over stupid. There are so few scenes of fright or attempt to scare that it's just a drill to go through. It's the worst in the movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: A fairly decent omnibus movie, there are a few minor issues that each of the stories spread, making it a less than perfect but still highly risky movie. Highly recommended for those in similar movies at the moment or who enjoy British horror movies. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating PG-13: Violence
