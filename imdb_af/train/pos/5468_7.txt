I saw the recovered, or any version of the case, from "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell, Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pumped by her own Father because she was 14! Then his silence blew up and he died to leave Lily (Stanwyck) alone for her black girl Chico, who was very well played by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) who decides to use her sex to get to the top. She does it in a good style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a pudgy clerk to enter the ground floor and continues to go through men like disposable candy! One shuts his fiancee and drops his father-in-law, also Lily's dairy, and commits suicide! Lily barely cut! Stanwyck is wonderful as a girl who doesn't really know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris she falls to Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but if he is in deep financial straights, his bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, she realized she loved the court! Lily races to get him, but will she be late? <br /> <br /> It's Hollywood preview at its best. Stanwyck is great and the look and music in the movie is perfect. It reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored movie with an amoral wife, those holding the films of ultra-romantic railings, don't like Baby FAce, those with faith in sex, love and may love it. Highly recommended! See it!
