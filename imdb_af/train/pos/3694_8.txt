Wasn't sure what to expect from this movie because of its incredible collection of stars and directors, but eventually it didn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the last episode to talk to the American tourist with a terrible French accent (which makes me feel better about mine), which actually touches a lot and a great way to movie turn. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and victim was also very moving and for pure comedy, the Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi take the award. The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive, although it was quite ambitious. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hoskins segment was completely cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely over. The dialogue in West Craven's division also forced a lot and the Chinatown story was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish. It is not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they just last 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
