I'm so glad I got the chance to see this rare jewel of a movie. I saw it at an independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your town soon. During the film I noticed that about 10 people were getting up and going. Too bad for them (here in the south people don't like to read captions). The movie starts slowly but is so rich in dialogue that I never got bored. When the action finally arrived, I glued myself as if I had a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got a big kick from the chapter titles that appear in front of the chapters, especially those that launch The characters as they appear on the screen. It reminds me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you see face-level bosses. <br /> <br /> If it's the future of the "video game / comic book" movies, then I'm staying there.
