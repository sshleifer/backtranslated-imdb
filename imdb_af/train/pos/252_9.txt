The performances were excellent, the costumes had a unique feel to the period and is a Victorian living historian. I was impressed with the accuracy of weapons and attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I won't say you don't need any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay on the flow of this movie, but to understand the events and attitudes of the time, you'll find a some basic historical knowledge needed. Don't expect any of the characters to know the Auzzie accent as we know it, as some foolish people did, it was a country at the time. <br /> <br /> OK, the story has some elements of fiction, but it is needed for a wider result of the movie. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature on the DVD he wanted his movie to inspire an interest. And that's exactly what happened to me, so this movie gets the thumbs up here. <br /> <br /> See it and you won't be sorry
