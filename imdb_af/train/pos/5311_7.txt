John Waters' most accessible movie to date is one of his better, as it is cut down on all the campus and complete vulgarity that most of his previous works look. Certainly, the nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a fashion <br /> <br /> that cannot be considered as dirty or disgusting. Due to some great decisive choices, this film really took out the psychology associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and somewhat sad (if it is possible for Waters), it is one of those movies I would see on a rainy day.
