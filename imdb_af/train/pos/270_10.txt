I have to say, Seventeen & Missing are much better than I expected. The perception I took from the preview was that it would be just humdrum, but I was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), does not attend a so-called graduation party one week night, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and in any case takes off for the party. When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something is wrong and begins to have her daughter's visions and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen and missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this movie, and most of it comes down to credibility. This LMN original movie took place last night. 10/10
