A pre-code that is thinner with Stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top. These pre-code flicks really do nothing to the imagination. Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly, the daughter of a speakeasy owner / father who sold more than liquor to his patrons (Johns). After the old man dies (well!) Barb heads for the big city for better things. She uses her feminine features to sleep her way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors are getting better with age and acting coach. I loved the banter and strong lines between the actors. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs and to see Stanwyck who is wonderful and wonderful as Lilly.
