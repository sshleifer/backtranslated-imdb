I'm not at all picky about horror movies, and I'm ready to watch almost any of them. This does not mean that I am willing to look at many of them again, or that I will not criticize them. This movie is creepy and well done. In fact, I think this movie will make an excellent double account with Session 9. <br /> <br /> Before I get to my comments, I have to specify that I've seen it alone. I started watching it before going to bed, and about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective, I saved the rest for the morning. Even when it was broad daylight, it was rather creepy. However, I cannot ascertain how effective it will be if I look at a larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, a couple moves to a remote cabin as a way to try terms with this death. Let me get acquainted with this death - this is one of the rare movies that doesn't stay away from a child's death. This is much more important as it both sets the tone, as well as much of the play that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple are not doing well. The woman diverted her from the relationship, and the man did what he could to bring her back. While some of the comments complained about their acting, they specified that they act more like a father and daughter as a husband and wife, and that is legitimate. He tries to give her more direction. It is a role that men sometimes touch. <br /> <br /> There are a variety of scares in the movie, and most are fairly non-violent, though grotesque in some ways. The story itself feels very simple for most of the movie, and takes a strange twist near the end. While the turn is not absurd, it's definitely not what you expected from the way things are progressing. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well done for something shot at video.
