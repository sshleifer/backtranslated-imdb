Watching Before The Devil is one of my best theater experiences. I was irritated by the mixed reaction to the film - and to me, the extremes of opinion on the film touched on something that the general audience embraced or denied. It's one of those movies that stayed with me and I think about it and think about it. <br /> <br /> Surely the DVD will relieve more of the themes and movie elements? These include: Sidney Lumet's return film, the storytelling magazine technique, the excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the masterful direction, the relatively rare focus of Hollywood movies to male characters and their vastness doomed struggling to become an open checkbook for their wives, the underperformance, but nonetheless, Marisa dispenses Tomei's performance, and of course the wonderful Hoffman with the central monologue about the sum of his parts - the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> Phew! Certainly a masterful movie. So imagine my disappointment watching the DVD - just to find no comment, no behind the scenes, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hey distributors - sort it out!
