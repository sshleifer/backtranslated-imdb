Most people who have seen this movie think it is the best movie ever made. I disagree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad assman and knows he is intimidating and uses it to come forward. It's about him and how he goes from dishes to a big house and an office with cocaine over the desk. If you want a family movie, then it's not the way to go, but if you want people and revenge opportunities and things like that, you'll love it.
