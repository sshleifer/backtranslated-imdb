This movie is not about a cat and mouse fight as mentioned in the other comments. It's about a cat who used 8 of his 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing his last one. The cat is jumping and killed all the time for death, hence the name 'fraidy cat'. Fraidy Cat's past lives haunt him as a ghost of different times in time and is constantly trying to kill him, but he is most afraid of the ninth life portrayed as a cloud in the form of a number 9 and boasts lighting bolts. very old now but will still be fun for the kids if you get a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
