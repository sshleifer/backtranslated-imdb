I have to admit that this is the type of movie I would normally violate, but I basically rented it because of the stars. I was definitely not sorry. In fact, as you can see, I rated it five stars. This film is the perfect combination of sharp live and superior plays. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the unashamed crime to rob their parents' jewelry store. The crime goes awry - so an investigation of the three men in the Hanson family begins. Through a series of flashbacks, we teach Charles Hanson to understand the tense relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> Younger brother, Hank is actually a screwdriver. He has always had trouble keeping a job and going a lot toward the wind. Hank is unsafe, cowardly and much under the influence of his big brother. Ethan Hawke nailed the character of Hank "to a T" which is probably his best performance so far. He shows us a man who is basically kind, but so influenced by outside forces that he cannot do with any important task. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - seems to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover he's addicted to drugs and is stunned by his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who understands the scheme to rob his parents' shop, and he wants Hank to do the job badly. Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the best actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a beautiful businessman who is kept by his acquaintances, but a real grinder at the bottom. He is absolutely perfect for Andy's part or it can be said that he has made Andy the perfect part by his superior acting skills. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father who is common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or uncomfortable man, but he has a bad relationship with his sons because he never really understands what was needed to nurture a positive bond between his sons and himself. He was always too quick to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he benefited his younger son from his parent and thus caused a wide emotional gap between himself and Andy. As we get to know Charles and Andy, Andy's idea of ​​robbing his father is less incredible. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I can't believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own. dad, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I enjoyed the movie as much as this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother came so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I have never been able to commit a crime against my parents - think we were made of sterner and more moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex of personalities and actions is expertly composed by director, Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three, he still has the links to give the audience what gives characters and stocking-seat action that hypnotize. 12 Angry Men Made His First Movie Fifty Years Before The Devil Knows You Are Dead, But He Didn't Lose Some Of His Magic. He showed us characters that will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> The events and characters in Before the devil knows you are dead is hard and unattractive, and it is certainly not a good movie. However, it is two hours of ultimate entertainment that I highly recommend.
