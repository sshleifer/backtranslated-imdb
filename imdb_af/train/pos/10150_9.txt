Sure, this movie is juicy and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's entertaining, and that's what I watch movies. To be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with the short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty cannot be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure the women love him. The two of them looked like eacb others in this movie. I do not understand the comment that there was no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were nice to watch, although d'Abo's British accent went into her supposed Bronx speech. To tell the truth, I didn't really notice it before reading this comment, but I returned to the DVD and now her dialogue is more British than American, but she was ideal for her role with the one exception. <br /> <br /> It is a story of two beautiful people who marry significant others but who find their soulmates in each other. It may be an unlikely story, but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries? It is no longer unrealistic than any of the dramas sifted on the tube every hour. That is why we look for a short time to escape from everyday life and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did it well, but hey, I am a sentimental man who easily breaks out. Don't get me wrong, it must be a sentimental scene, and this movie has a lot of them. <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10 just because I'm saving 10/10 for that. yet unseen super-beautiful film I know comes a day together. If you see it being advertised to come on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or whatever, make a note of it. I think you will like it.
