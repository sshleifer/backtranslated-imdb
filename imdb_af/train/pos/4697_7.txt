Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerous" in this on gangster movies made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. In the 1930s, Keaton played a pet shop owner who steals a baby stealing a puppy and then tells in flashback how he came to own the pet shop. He changed to theft at a young age to get his mother a pancreatic operation ($ 49.95, especially this week) and started working for a Boyle. Johnny uses that surname "Dangerous" in the gang world. <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny's dirty mouth ever needs to replace any organ in her body. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny show, just like Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA who won't play a ball with Burr (Danny De Vito). Like Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is wonderful. Richard Dimitri is a notable as Moroni, torturing the English language - but you have to hear him rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that he does it all with a bad face. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a little tired after the end, but it's good to see, and Keaton is great as good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason this movie was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's other jewel, "Night Shift", you don't hear much of it. With a few gigs and scenes that are true gems, you'll find "Johnny Dangerously" very enjoyable.
