This film is an interesting attack on the killer-scarecrow genre - incredible can increase to grow larger than the sum of its parts. Average montage scenes, 30-somethings play teens, and some excellent facial expressions combine one of the "new-wave" of modern classics. As a viewer I got away from the movie with the same feeling of "shock and awe" as when I first saw the Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner's striking portrayal of morally bankrupt Judy deserves her Grammy nomination, which was well-documented stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, one of the successors cannot live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the Godfather series that improved with each installment and in 2012 with Godfather 4: My Rage must eat.
