I sat down to watch this movie with lots of tension and little hope. I didn't think it would be possible for this movie to address its topic. But it did absolutely, and then some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon. Sometimes it looked like Harris Lennon could channel. The parable was often rude, and he clearly studied Lennon's ways and vocal insights. Aiden Quinn was pretty good like McCartney, who also had a striking deal with Macca, though he occasionally did his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This work of fiction was well written and well directed. Of course it was pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur who had gone through a keyhole at this reunion. The rooftop scene was especially moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child - that he was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he had left his parents. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the two of them danced with absolute commitment to the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My one complaint would be: I'm not so sure that John was so bitten as he was at this stage in his life. He settled very nicely in his domestic situation, and he was actually known to be very friendly when approached by fans. Just a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for a signature on the day he was murdered. <br /> <br /> Most of these movies resurrected these feelings about what might have happened to John a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles came back at some point. And I'm very sure Lennon and McCartney will still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I'll see it again. <br /> <br />
