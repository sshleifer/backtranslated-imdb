"The Lady in Question (1999)", called Gene Wilder, is a good mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black and white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Both Perry and "Cash" guessed me to the end. There were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but I didn't know what character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special way of loving about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal ties that make him perfect for the part. The parts of the movie that actors observed were very well done. I'm sure it's an additional challenge for the cast to pull off. I'm not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. Even his singing was a joy. I like him in this role more than his previous "softer" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope A&E will continue this series. They should call it something like "The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries". <br /> <br /> The music fits into the era. I enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes. Initially, I was unclear whether we would look back on whether the action took place during that period. And I disagree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary for the flow of writing. For me it is always distracted. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-crafted start in what we hope will be many - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Burr's Perry Mason.
