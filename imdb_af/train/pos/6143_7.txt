Never seen this 1971 movie and was very entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played an excellent role as a woman who took a witchcraft course and was a student who started flying a broomstick and had a few problems to take away. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a difference to different parts of the world. Eglantine, however, missed her final exams to become a completed witch. Mr Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person Eglantine had sold this course in witchcraft and he tried to help her find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for her madness and that is to stop the Nazis from evading England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies today.
