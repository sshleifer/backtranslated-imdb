Ten of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (I just found the Egyptian one disappointing). Stragely, except the Mexican director, chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinchets coup and subsequent massacre, suicide attacks in Israel, paranoia hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the US, old people living alone, and the aftermath of World War II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. It may mean something sadders about the limits of empathy: the directors can feel that Americans ignore the pain of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies while effectively doing the same with their short films. br /> <br /> Surprise me, I found Sean Penn's piece one of the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also recommend his performance by Ernest Borgnine as a half-gray old man in a New York apartment, his widow's life is experiencing the happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the WTC "rolled out", I think it could also be one of the most offensive as the general American audience would see .
