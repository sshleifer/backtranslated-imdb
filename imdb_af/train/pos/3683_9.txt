18 directors had the same task: tell stories of love in Paris. Of course, some of them look better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming. Besides, wouldn't it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? Here's how I arrange the segments (which may change on a second show): <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin" by Gerard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors ever targeted my favorite segment, with the well-known Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Sharp and tasty. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of The Triplets of Belleville) story of a little boy whose parents are mime; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Children of Men"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touch); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th Arrangement", Alexander Payne ("Election", "About Schmidt") wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here. the underrated actress Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in Million Dollar Baby) as a lonely middle-aged American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's ("Run Lola Run") devastating style works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind man (Melchior Beslon) falling in love <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", by Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but moving story of talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story. the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elia Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais the Signals", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires", by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille", by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underrated "My Life Without Me", feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", through and through Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments as brilliant and other than average (or even slightly boring), but none of them are simply bad. Overall I give 'Paris' Je t'Aime' a 8.5 / 10 and recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic of love and other things in between.
