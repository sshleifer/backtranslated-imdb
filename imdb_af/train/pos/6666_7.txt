I can't say this movie is earned, near the amount of vitriol picked up by some reviewers. Yes, it is trapped by excessive run time, outdated editing, and excess cheeseball special effects. And it doesn't have much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience to sit through without looking at his or her watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and serious cast, and the classic undercover provision. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the core team, and Garofalo and Studi do excellent work that adds conflict and variety to the team. I can't say that Reubens or Mitchell added much to the movie overall, although everyone had a few chances to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic "hide-and-seek" good. No surprises there because you know they're going to win. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Among all this, these people are children of heart, who just want to do right. The best scenes in the film give this movie its emotional foundation. Look at Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy's engaging innocence in his reluctance to accept Cap. Amazing's Secret Identity; Stiller's anger (no different from that strange, spazzy child you ever knew that has always been in trembling, impotent rage on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge her father. This childlike conviction that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics; And under the parodic exterior, "Mystery Men", we show why this hackneyed comic book is making so many tropics. <br /> <br /> It's never really a satisfactory whole because of the large number of half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is so much fun that it's for care. The fact that it is supposed to be good, uncomfortable fun seems to be lost to some of the judges here, so I will make a warning: if you are the kind of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy mockup that has been devastated by the inexplicable and illogical ("Am I to believe this is a kind of .. * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone?") then you are too literal and humorous for this movie. Rather rent a Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
