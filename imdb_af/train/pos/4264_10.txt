I saw this movie twice or more and made it good! World War II was freshly ended and the so-called "Cold War" was underway. This film can therefore be defined as one of the best propaganda, patriotic films that Americans prepare, and secondly, people from the still-formed "Western NATO bloc" of countries facing the next upcoming threat. The movie celebrates the power of the US over the centuries as it emerged after the war that had just ended. Beautiful and funny is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus, and the "espisode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian. Must see it (at least once, for curiosity of fashion of propaganda over time)! :)
