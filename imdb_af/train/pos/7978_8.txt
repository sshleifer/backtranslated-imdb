This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge films should have and that is true emotion. Sadness, love, laugh, anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this movie. From start to finish, this film is very fascinating. The plot on paper sounds like the usual junk that is mostly thrown into the faces of the audiences, but does not get wrong. This movie is powerful. Washington is always a good thing. <br /> <br /> The plot in a nutshell: One suffers from depression, a young girl brings life to him, children are kidnapped, the man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like something special, but it's much better than any other similar movie out there. BRANCH is immediately a similar film, but when you compare them, MAN ON FIRE wins hands. The characters are alluring and everyone is in a good performance and directing is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is depicted brilliantly. the style of direction was something I enjoyed and the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you bring out once a year to watch again or a movie that you will beg family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are furious with the main character, making it a rollercoaster journey. There is plenty of action to keep you happy, there is enough character development to please you and then there is Washington to bring a smile to your face. Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed
