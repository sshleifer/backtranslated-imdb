It was one of the highlights of ST: TNG's half-yearly second season, before growing up or becoming in their third season. Not only was it a showcase for the performances like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but was also a continuation of Data's quest for his 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. Another of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> On a synot, I'm still disappointed that there's no credit for the actress whose character Okona is about to have a most fun (after Teri Hatcher's character) before being cruelly interrupted by Lt Worf. I remember remembering to watch this episode 'first run' at my friends' comic store and we all thought she would be a perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful lady really is ...
