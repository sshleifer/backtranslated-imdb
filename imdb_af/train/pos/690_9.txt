I had no idea what this movie was about or even knew it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon looking for other movies staring at Dominic Monaghan. I thought this movie was a strange insight into the idea of ​​a no-sleeper and that might work his / her mind in the hours they were awake when the rest of the world was asleep. It was an interesting movie and a good part was played by Dom ....... I believe that although this movie you can't buy (and I have never seen it), you should see it as you Ever get the chance because it will really make you think of the people around us who can't sleep and have to sleep at night or not just sleep about 1 hour. Overall, it's an interesting movie of good dust.
