This movie has no story. It's just about a lot of guys killing an innocent young girl. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> That's what they do: they hit her in a net and let her hang in like bird food, turn her around on a chair until she pukes, expose her to loud noise, throw boiling oil on her, puts worms in her sores, squeezes her hand with a sledge hammer and eventually picks a needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> This movie was so realistic that if I didn't know it was, I'd have thought it was a snuff movie. Although I was disgusting for this movie, I really liked it. It scared me. I think it fills a kind of goal. I give it a 10/10.
