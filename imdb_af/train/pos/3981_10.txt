It's my fourth Joe McDoakes short of what I've seen and so far the funniest one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record portraying Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio goes (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions that both get confused. Then he meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice, which is not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and comes to the point where he automatically upset the director. I will stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star that was near the end. The last scene was especially a hoot so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch, so you want to be in Picutres!
