Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of geeks walk around and say the return of the Jedi is not good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! It makes it bad! Everyone liked the return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment on it. Now suddenly people look at you as you have illness if you mention how much you like it. This movie is so much better than anything that Kevin Smith has ever even considered creating that it is my mind that the man would even think of rejecting it. This movie is fun! It's just as nice as I remember it was when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's views! She's not right! <br /> <br /> And that Ewok song has ended! I bet your people don't even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'm gonna burn you all!
