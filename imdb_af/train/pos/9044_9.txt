I recently saw this movie because of Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I'd see the movies I missed. I had no expectations in the film, so surprised that I didn't miss this movie at all. It is a pleasant father and son story, and it is also a wonderful story. I even shed a tear in the final of this wonderful story. This movie appeals to all ages. The only reason I give it 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle, but it eventually comes back strongly. The play was wonderful, the story was great, and the movie art was fascinating given the setting of the movie. Go see this movie! Rent it, buy it, watch it, LOVE THIS! I know I did it!
