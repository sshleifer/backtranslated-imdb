I knew but had never seen Gray Gardens before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends warned me that if I didn't see the movie, the musical didn't make sense. It did, but it also asked me to rent the movie. Initially I thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, screaming characters, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But to stop, digest and go back, I realized why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their total lack of self-awareness is worth seeing. Both remain beautiful despite their remaining age. They have a relationship that any woman (and undoubtedly some men) will chill and make you review your own relationship with your mother. In an era where reality television and kiosks are common, it is fascinating to see the Mayleses work three decades ago and realize what impact the film had. <br /> <br /> I echo what other posters said: how were they allowed to slip through their family in such a scab? But further, how can two people living in the 1970s escape the reality in such a complete way? Or are they simply considered to be crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend seeing it with the commentary, which gave me extra insight into the movie.
