Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the major. To watch him, beat a song if it's not an entire album, the man quickly showed to be a real talent. He thinks he is god, but is so advantageous and interesting. The DW is not really that interesting compared to music or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" , Anton tells the cameraman: "Well, we can make this guitar pawn!". Great use of archive / home video material. Great to see that rock documents are still being made. A cool document about the creative process. If you want, check out Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sale! on DVD. A good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
