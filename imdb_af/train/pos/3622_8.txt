I knew I was going to see it when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one reason, but the theme to hold onto your dreams is talking to me. People talk about this as a movie for children, but I think it is a movie for baby boomers who grow up with older, poor parents, our own deaths, our children and leave us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall into the fall of the tragedy; It's about living your dreams mean when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a jug, but it looks good, and Rachel Griffiths plays a small role as the woman in a thoughtful, layered display. The camera work is slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they left out everything that was not needed. Very pretty.
