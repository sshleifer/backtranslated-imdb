This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" from Kevin Klein, you get a kick. Dave "Dave" went to South America as Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, a job-seeker, chosen by the head of the island nation of Parador's secret police, to the drunk fool of a dictator, Alfonse Simms. replaced after he had a heart attack and died. Noah bumbles together, supports in his role by the ex-dictator's mistress, while attempting to weaken Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also emerges as a warm American emigrant who appears to be CIA. It's also the lead of Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are a few absurd moments like the old dictator's body being frozen for a year, and the last scene where Sonia Braga, the bloody, dot of Dreyfus becomes moments later in pristine seen white, with nary a stain on her. But everything is a big skirt.
