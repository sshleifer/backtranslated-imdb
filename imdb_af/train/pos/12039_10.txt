The black woman is fantastic in every way. It's scary, exciting and so realistic that you can actually see it happen in real life. I only saw it on TV in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume turned up, it was probably the most terrible experience of my whole life. I managed to get a copy, and now I make sure it comes out every Halloween and shows it to unsuspecting family members, who don't know what they are involved with, and all I can do is laugh. Regarding the film: <br /> <br /> It starts with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who has been assigned by his firm to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to establish the papers of a newly died client - Mrs. . Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out as a fairly solid and interesting ghost story. But then Arthur goes to the funeral and from that scene we don't feel safe. We're constantly on the edge and biting our nails, and it's going to the next hour or so to the final, exciting final. <br /> <br /> A warning to all new viewers though: don't look alone. ..
