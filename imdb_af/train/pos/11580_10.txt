As another reviewer, Hanna's War is an excellent film about an outstanding person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who becomes the Jews of Arc. Unfortunately, I disagree that this is not exactly the case. Detmer as the lead too nice to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In fact, for her, her performance is not held back by her beauty, but makes it all the stronger in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistance she faces. The performance of Maruschka Detmer is brave, offensive, sincere or understandable and completely credible. In other words, to me, "In the zone." of the opening credits. If you want to learn about someone else's suffering for something they believe and be entertained with, Hanna's War gives Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother a well-known and well-known actress who made the effort to walk with the film. This may be a team effort by two actresses, but not an All-around situation.
