Forcing a tour! OK, the child Oliver plays is a little toooooo sweet! Starting with the great cinematography, color, costumes and most impressive performances, this is a movie to watch. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above all of them and it's a musical start! It's a masterful Fagan, who never leaves his character to do a song. You never really know whether you love him or not, the same feeling I have in the book. In other versions, you hate him from start to finish. Bill Sykes .... if you read the book, it's a mean one, and so he is in this movie. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his last movie, Gladiator, based on his very good performances, not to see the headliners. The music matches the times and the mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
