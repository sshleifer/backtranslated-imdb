* I notice where there are spoilers! Overall Comment: If you can take a serious movie, check out. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Don't leave the theater because you're confused about what's going on! The movie fits well in the second half. I'll take my mom to see it again when the movie opens officially. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see it at a screen a few weeks ago, when Will promoted the movie. He was wonderful. Spend a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the photo Sal! About Will's Show: Many times when you watch a movie with an actress who is really famous for another movie / performance, you always think of them in their current performance, just as you think of them for their past. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I didn't post the Fresh Prince (lol) when I watched this movie. He was completely and completely convincing in this very, very serious role. He grew tremendously as an actor. I think he'll get at least an Oscar cut for this show. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicting and tormented. He is sad ... guilty feelings ... very determined, but very scared. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, it'll be done. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario had a good job depicting Emily, a woman who is very much behind her. tax. Maybe she's not the bright star. Will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character just didn't work as much as Will's did. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no spoilers): I admit I didn't like the movie the second half. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie that went into it, and nothing made sense to the second part of it. But when things finally come together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's a very intense movie that really sticks to you. <br /> <br /> It really takes a lot of time to look. In the theater I was in, most people cried to the end - even adults. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why is it a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Less SPOILERS ***** That's why it's very difficult to talk about the plot without giving away big things. I feel too much about this movie really ruining it. However, there was much symbolism in the movie I enjoyed. I'll call it here (without giving away much). <br /> <br /> The fish Ben held in his hotel room. Initially, it doesn't make sense. There were a lot of conversations in the movie when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> I hated the beginning of the movie. At the end I loved him and hated him. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was a big lick for Ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way into the world. Why he treated Ezra so, later became the movie later. Wait for it already. Everything in this movie: wait it out. <br /> <br /> -Ben is a fundamental good person who has made a big mistake for which he will not forgive him. It is still unclear to me if he does what he does because he tries to get rid of his own debt or if he really wants to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but also got rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he does is nothing short of wonderful. You hate him because of what he does to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice work Sal.
