The arrival of white men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter. <br /> <br /> MGM's peripatetic director, W. S. Dyke, was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic under the Inuit. His production was filmed in place from April 1932 to November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show some of the shootings in the Studio have recovered). While we were considered a documentary at the time, we would probably call it a 'docudrama', as it is written with an intriguing plot and story. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the daily life of the Eskimo, both Winter and Summer, and actually begins to see in the warmer time of year without snow or ice. The constant pursuit of food is portrayed, and the viewer gets the exciting hunt for walrus, polar bear, whale and caribou. The mother tongue is used throughout, using title cards; The only English is spoken by the fishermen and bergies experienced by the Eskimo. In fact, this is the arrival of White Men, both good and bad, and the change they make to the Eskimo community, which is a key element of the narrative. <br /> <br /> This Pre-Code film deals with a refreshing respect with the Eskimo moral code, especially with their practice of women's division, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable glimpse into a way of life that even vanishes early in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> None of the role players receive screen credits, it's a pity if there are some notable performances. The top among them is Ray Wise, who plays the lead role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan native of Inuit ancestors and is absolutely beautiful and utterly credible in what was a very demanding part. He is as attractive as a Hollywood star, and will continue with Ray Mala's actions, in a sporadic film career, often in small, unfair roles. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Japanese Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala's loyal second wife; The names of the fine actresses that his other two women play are now dark. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North-West-mounted police inspector. The two decent Mounties to give Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dearing, both years of movie characters. Danish writer Peter Freuchen, on whose books the film is based, has a short, vibrant role of an evil wooden legged sea captain who indifferently unleashes Mala's icy wrath.
