Solino really surprised me with his deep-drawn characters. While it was a simple story of rivalry between two brothers, it wasn't just hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi had made especially if he had to get his mother back to her home town in Italy and not attend the festival award ceremony that his film included. To see this character struggling so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty towards his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he once again tried to reach out to his father, he was brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who, while more confident and older brother, had so many uncertainties. A very beautiful movie that makes me laugh and cry.
