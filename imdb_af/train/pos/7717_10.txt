I loved this movie all my life. It's also such an intelligent story, with many classic additions. e.g. The ship missing decades earlier is called the Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology it was the man who killed the Chimera, a legendary beast consisting of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera and his Id monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies where writers have clearly credited their audiences with a kind of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters who spend $ 150m on special effects, but about $ 1.50 on a script. <br /> <br /> Cheers
