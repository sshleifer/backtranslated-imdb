It was a very good movie and it is absolutely unfair to judge it without considering when it was released. There are some movies that don't get older, but it is clearly outdated. However, I saw this movie when I was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images like the story to me and most of my friends were unforgettable, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. Actually, I remember this movie as the subject of various conversations and meetings where old boys talk about things we have in common. So there was a little sense of disappointment and even sadness when we finally had the DVD. First, there was a theory of how our generation was. Secondly, I think there's something more. I will benefit from this movie having something that should be interesting to all modern filmmakers, specifically those focusing on the dilapidated horror genre. It's the mutilation, the idea that gives coherence to the movie; the fact that one is mutilated causes a deeper terror than death and torture. I remember how sick the sensation was when the monster dried Kurt's arm. And at the end; when the beings bite the doctor's neck to take part of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere that dominates without falling through all the screens in intensity, no matter if the action is on a secret laboratory, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a sturdy dressing room, and so on. May be the reasons why it is no longer a good movie, but just technical stuff. For example, in the accident scene and the man who saves his fiance's head, a more accurate work for another and modern second unit director can be made interesting. Same thing with all action scenes, including one of Kurt's arm. Furthermore, something can be done with the sample's makeup. Some remakes were good; I think in this case an effort will be worth it. Nevertheless, the black and white colors must be preserved.
