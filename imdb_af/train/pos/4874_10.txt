Kusturika made it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, making a party! The music is everywhere, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and wonderful gadgets and inventions, all visually colorful to just entertain. Pure theater in essence. A wonderful experience to watch. And one is especially grateful, as good comedies are so scarce, and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you enjoyed Kusturica's previous movies, you will love it, but as in all comedies, it's about a chemical reaction and you have to think about it.
