I was absolutely fascinated by this series from the moment Tom Long walked into the lap - the whole 'bad boy' thing, it was just addictive. <br /> <br /> The story has your hook, what will happen next - Joey will get the girl in the end after being in jail for five years and thinking about his lost love all the time, with roads again cross her, find that he has a son. Although he is a violent bad guy, you still want to find happiness. <br /> <br /> Better-engaging two parties - please bring it to video!
