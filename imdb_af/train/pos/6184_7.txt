Since it's Black History Month, and I look at the achievements of many African Americans on film in chronological order, I found this movie on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his band were in it. Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the highlight of this mostly obsolete murder mystery musical comedy mix. Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle's especially "Sweet Marijuana", Carl Brisson's "Cocktails for Two" as well as his duet with Carlisle on it, and that of Gertrude Michael, who is good as the woman you love to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen are probably a little too long with their love / hate crooks as producer and detective, but they are growing on you. And Toby Wing is a sexy stupid battle that Nancy is still trying to tell something to Oakie, but every time he gets a "Not Now". While many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happened, I was not surprised at the revelation of who did it. And get a load of how naked the women are here (although their breasts are naturally covered, either by their hands or a little bit evil). It was very clear before code. Looking for any movie that is interested in this kind of thing is worth it. P.S. As a Louisiana resident, I am aware that someone here is born to New Orleans's Carlisle.
