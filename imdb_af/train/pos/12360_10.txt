I loved the movie. It beautifully analyzes the Italian petty-bourgeois society, how the left of the 70s gave their ideals and came to a happy arrangement that they didn't want to disturb. For example, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time, the video wanted to buy after watching the movie. Several times on the big screen and on the TV, but it seems to have disappeared completely from the market, even in Italy no one knew in the bookshops of the film. a great pity. <br /> <br /> The one sex scene, all of which seems to be going, doesn't hurt the movie.
