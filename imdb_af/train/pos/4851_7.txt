Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining film, characteristic of the better British comedy coolers of the 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they once seemed, but it can be overcome by viewing him as a period or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low-budget war time production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective, and it offers some sincere tension. Great fun for a dark (and yes, stormy) night. Lift up, take out the critic's hat and enjoy.
