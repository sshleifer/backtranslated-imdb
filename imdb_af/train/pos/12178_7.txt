I think this movie got a low rating because it was judged by its worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing scene, but in addition there are a few moments that make me laugh aloud. Jason Lee is doing a wonderful subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to damn funny herself. In addition, this movie plays like most romantic comedies. After about 40 minutes, it's clear how it's going to end. (What's better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch, but certainly not the worst choice. Cheers
