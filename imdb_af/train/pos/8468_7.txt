A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. There is a lot going on for just 74 minutes, but it works. The terrorists are very subtle, not the screenshots that populate the most recent Asian horror movies. The way the scares are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in "The Uninvited" (also known as 4 Inyong Shiktak, led by Su-Leon Lee), but it's not nearly the same caliber. The film does a nice job balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. I would recommend checking it out if you got a chance.
