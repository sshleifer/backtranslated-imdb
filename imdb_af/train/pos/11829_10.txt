For years I watched "Dick Tracy", which has become an important part of my life - it was with me through childhood and I often saw it. As an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino received - except that it is rarely discussed and not much of a fuss when it came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is over the top but with good effect as he has a lot of fun. Beatty is wonderful as Dick Tracy and behind the camera drive the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other movie, possibly, I've ever seen. Just a look at one scene from the movie is breathtaking. The lighting, velvet earrings and smog / smoke combine to create a good effect. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny cameos, including one from Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles," and I don't think there are any errors. Always in terms of acting - even the compulsory child character is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very fine movie that has been completely misunderstood over the years has been underestimated by only 5.7. / 10 average on IMDb. The critics' reviews are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the movie, it's not hard to see why. It's a perfect example of the essence of a cartoon, from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
