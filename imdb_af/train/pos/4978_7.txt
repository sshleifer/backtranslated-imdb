A nice Shirely Temple short. Child actors shouting their lines were the norm for that day and time. You may need to be "seen and not heard". Apart from that, it's fun. Given the film era, there are certain aspects of the matter, from a social point of view, which make me very progressive and liberal. I will not go here, I would rather not spoil it for you, but let it look for yourself and see if you touch those elements. As early as it was easy to abandon this brief, the fascination that had already developed for Temple was. It makes it worthwhile to see if you are a Temple fan. For others it is a good way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
