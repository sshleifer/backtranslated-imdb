<br /> <br /> I must admit I was expecting something completely different from my first view of 'Cut' last night, but was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror jewel. I am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found 'Cut' not only to be the best of the genre ever made by Australia, but one of the great parody / comedy films of late. <br /> <br /> My only problem is that the mainstream audiences may not pick up many of the comic elements - the movie wasn't too clever in the application, but made me laugh at every turn in every possible click of the horror genre they could fit. I'm sure it was meant to be humor .... hope it was meant as humor. <br /> <br /> And of course there were the gore. <br /> <br /> The use of the 'personal' garden shears was brilliant - except for the expected stitches and slides. In short, there was a great variety of variety and creativity in the very violent deaths, enough to appreciate even the skeptics of these films. <br /> <br /> The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short of her appearance) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the movie. Both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as the joystick. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple of years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody toungue-in-cheek to the end. <br /> <br /> Love it. Go see it!
