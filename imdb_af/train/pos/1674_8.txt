Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adulterous wife of a large businessman who experiences $ 1 million in life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business trip. Initially, she is suspected of being responsible since her husbands have recently changed and therefore she has an insurance investigator, Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her tail, just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece in cash in her heritage, but insists on having it cash ... a dangerous event. Lynch whose identity is now known to protect Baumer against a lover of her husband, Lara Florakis, who, however, with her henchman Sharif is trying to kill them for some of the money she is entitled to. And that's where our Masked killer starts his brutal murders. Lynch as usual with our hero was initially suspected by the Greek police and is warned not to leave Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, a famous face in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then helped by beautiful Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the murders. To say that the movie may ruin more for anyone who has not seen it, it is enough to say there is enough red hair and most of them are likely to keep Mystery / Thriller fans happy in this story driven Giallo. The No Shame DVD has an excellent transfer with both the English and Italian soundtrack. It also has a very catchy score, just for good measures by Bruno Nicolai who will stay in your head for a while. All in all, a first-rate Giallo.
