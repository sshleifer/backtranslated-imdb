I know this sounds strange to someone born nearly 15 years after the show stopped, but I like this show. I don't know why, but I enjoy watching. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I bought DVDs on was in Germany, and it was just the first two seasons. It's disappointing, but that's right. I'll keep watching online. If anyone has tips on where to buy the second through the 14th seasons, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. The only thing is that the DVDs are from Germany, they just play on my portable DVD player and my computer. Oh good. I still own it!
