The version I saw of this movie was the Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a swear word in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was funny like hell. It was also true. If you have ever spent time in Hollywood or the surrounding area, you will understand the humor. If not, you can't get it at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the business struggles to make it until they finally reach a breakpoint, it's a scarce jewel. It says it's a drama, but it's a drama as much as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to keep her own good. His performance is particularly impressive during the poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra, but we can't have everything.
