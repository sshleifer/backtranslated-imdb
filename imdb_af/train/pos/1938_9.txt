The big bad swim has a low budget, Indie feels about it. So many times I start watching independent movies that really had good reviews just to find out that they are pretentious crud. It is voted by people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the movie and the potential to challenge that they forget that the movie is. a form of entertainment in the first place. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor, if that happens then I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning BBS felt right, it was easy and warm and human, there were no big plays or meaningful insights, I just connected the characters directly. And when, as with all good movies, the end came, I felt sad about the loss of the bond. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big, or quick or informative, look elsewhere, look for a movie that is trying to deliver more than it can. BBS is delivering a solid, enjoyable, real-life experience and rewarding and saturation after watching it.
