Although I'm not the biggest fan of thread-based martial arts movies, as a movie goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting, I get much more fun from it and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic plot and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has made an enchanting taste here with good performance and a lot of ethereal beauty. The big, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax-cellar hero who stays in a haunted house for the night and becomes involved in a beautiful fox spirit and a crazy Taoist. Cheung's performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasantly off the beaten track as the Taoist monk, who shows a few sword expressions and even a musical number. Perhaps best of all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, a pleasure to see with every move and gesture that is annoyingly tempting. The film features elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance. Everyone is stirring together in a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, the management and management of the choreography gives a little neat thread, and fills the film with donkeys, shadows and frankly stunned, illuminated forest colors. This gives every forest scene a wonderful atmosphere. Also striking is the extensive hairstyles and beautiful flowing clothes of the female characters. If I'm not wrong, Joey Wang sports hair sometimes picked up a jackal like a fox, a wonderful touch. Although the movie is relatively small, it is sometimes a beautiful piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plot, even the strange neat character bow, an almost constant supply of visual delicacies and a very dreamy atmosphere. . An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
