Yes, when I sat there red-handed, I remember feeling almost guilty when I looked it back a few weeks, while my wife chose to look something like insignificant (in comparison) with "Mama Love". <br /> <br /> How do you explain Batman and Robin's appeal? I mean the only one who ever really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible performance, with terrible plots and terrible acting - and oh yes, it was terribly funny! And this also applies to this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it is stolen, and our poles (like them) jump into the characters of their old characters (if not their costumes) and go down to find out what happened. Along the way, they remind us of the series, and we see how it all came together in flashbacks. Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden play the young Adam and Burt of the TV series. It was really interesting to look at the old series behind the scenes, and Adam and Burt just returned to character (although they didn't really have character - well, you have to see it to see what I mean.) was also nice to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of the old series, you'll hate it. If - heaven forbids - you actually thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney had made acceptable "Batmans", then you would hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and are still willing to admit you've never missed an episode, well, this one is for you. Yes, that's true. 9/10
