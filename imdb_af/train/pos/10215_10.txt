Most people who follow movie with Audrey Tautou do not look like Amelie is a character. It's not actually Audrey Tautou's real life personality. Therefore, every movie she participates in will not be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc. Don't be. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also recorded this movie simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it is true, there is a big gap to the first scene where she is not seen about 45 minutes at all, but I didn't even miss her because I had so much fun with the other characters. The man who lies about everything is too funny, the man who justifies people running out of his cafe and going out on the bill by finding coupons and so what is the loss, actually .... to get all the characters here, Can take quite a while, but it's one of the best movies I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou's character Irene is not the exaggerated sugary girl Amelie. In fact, like Irene, she initially frightened her rudeness of a bum that demanded change. In this movie, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but in the course of a (very terrible) day, her mind becomes increasingly acidic and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie very good is that you have built all these very interesting stories and plots ... very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all the characters can actually act. The best part of the movie is about 20 minutes left. This is when all the plots start to work together and the ride really picks up, and everything binds and makes sense and the whole butterfly effect blooms. I swear, it was the best 20 minute movie I've seen for a while, and the end ... It made me think, "damn, I was lucky to find this movie." In addition, the end to this movie is. Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are all these other subplots going on, but somehow they all work together (and in a meaningful way as it is here), but also make every character feel human and alive, not just an old man used as a crutch to build this whole butterfly effect. Very impressive. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest this movie because it's a good movie to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.
