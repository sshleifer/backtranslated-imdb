They took me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy little Mayberry-like place with one small difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is the spoiler. Not like you won't find out in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep him well, but it is an uphill battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him to get to know the ways of darkness. Subtle. Crook. He doesn't always get so angry. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor, because he often makes a disaster and saves them. So every time you think somebody will eventually slow him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the bush in a cabin. and some guys with guns decided to rob them. Lucas uses it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson on evil. <br /> <br /> The robber (Ted) was reluctant to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had a half conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot them now. If he had a real conscience, he would never have been a criminal. Then he started calling him Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He was inciting the criminals. And of course he kept ten steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times. And of course he was in full control at all times. They actually benefited you from Satan. <br /> <br /> Very good show. It was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It's good company.
