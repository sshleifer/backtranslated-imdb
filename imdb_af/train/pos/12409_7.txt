The prison is not often raised during conversations about the best eighty horror films, and there is a good reason for it not being one of the best ... but if you pass the classic films that had to be offered the decade, It's definitely among the best of lesser-known / smaller movies. The film is somewhat related to blockbusters; For a start, it's an early guide to Renny Harlin; the capable director of a number of action films, including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly, we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star, Viggo Mortensen. The movie is not exactly original, but the plot line is interesting. We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. It was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison governor. Of course, the spirit of the dead does not rest in peace; and when the old executor room is reopened, the spirit of the dead conviction escapes revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie is not exactly the Shawshank Redemption, but it doesn't build up its various characters and while The Main Point of the movie is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all for an interesting base. It's also a good job because, unlike the basic premise, the movie doesn't really have a plot and we rely on the interaction between characters to keep things interesting. The horror that appears in the movie is sometimes grotesque, but it is never over, which may be the reason why this film is rarely remembered, which is released in a decade of excess. However, the murders themselves are pretty good and imaginative and offer some important highlights. As the film is underway, we begin to deepen the story of the mysterious suspect's ghost, and while it is quite interesting, some things do not make sense and drag the film off a bit. Yet, everything comes to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that the Prison is a movie worth finding.
