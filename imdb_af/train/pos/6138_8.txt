It's an old-fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with the most enjoyable beginner witch ever. Unlike many modern stories that appear in dark witchcraft, it is just a magical story of hocus pocus that is cute, light and charming. <br /> <br /> The story was back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, were evacuated from danger from World War II air strikes. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become a student witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magical bed button to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent head of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss. Price sets to work on spells designed to bring alive objects to life. Meanwhile, they also have to deal with a shady character, called the Bookman and his collaborator, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Of course, Angela Lansbury is wonderfully engaging as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, head of the rounded witchcraft school, has now become a street college. This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this movie is a story reminiscent of former Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this movie does not have such a memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it boasts some attractive little ones. Some are critical, but the movie has excellent special effects. All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. It is a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this beautiful and staggering story, which should appeal to the child in all of us.
