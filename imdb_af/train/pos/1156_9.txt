Years ago, I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie, and I was so rewarded to find it. It's a great spoof of souls, with jealousy, the ordinary players' insecurities, and all sorts of wonderful excesses. But more than anything - an incredible cast and incredible writing. How did anyone play all the top action actors in such a silly movie? And how did these little movie writers get to write the perfect lines? I never hear anyone talking about this movie or even admit it being heard, but it's great and I recommend seeing it. Sometimes I throw it up while I do housekeeping, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying the wonderful thing. Congratulations to all who made it.
