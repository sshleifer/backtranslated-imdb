It's one of the best movies out there and it says a lot that it was for television. I really wish it was on that. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a rough performance. She played a vegetable cup that was perfectly thrown into a serial killer. When she fell apart because he killed another child, it was wonderful. She's so alone, so he gets her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing the kids, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really don't make them any more. It was a real thriller without being.
