This film Evil Breed: The legend of Samain contains very little thought or effort. It is mocked with specifications of ultra-fast "slasher" style deaths and ordinary disgusting acts of death. The play was a D-score, as the actors had very little ability, and the stupidity of them in the film was too doubtful. The way they portray how people act their ages was incredibly different. The strange division of pornography is well-thought out that it does not offer much, and any area that is respectful, but dies fairly quickly with absolute gut learning. For example, the poor fellow who deviates from his anus, and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. It is extremely clear from how little of a fight the children turned up. This movie is a good choice for someone who likes to see terrible deaths and virtually torture.
