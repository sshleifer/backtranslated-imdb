Although I've been a fan of Peter Weir for a long time, I didn't watch any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise. Richard Chamberlain plays David, an attorney invited to defend five aborigines charged with killing another Aborigine. For David's peers, this is a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. But David believes there is a mystery under the murder, linked to tribal rituals. As his investigation continues, he not only teaches things about his clients, but also himself. <br /> <br /> To reveal more will be to spoil one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I can only say that this movie is heading for nobody to expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make it a fascinating movie: Chamberlain's play; but also the performances by David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who launches David in tribal history; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aborigine who is a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters are at the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also the way Weir represents the supernatural in the film. David has dreams that warn him of the future. Australia is experiencing terrible weather, with storms, hail and even a mysterious black rain that can be nothing more than pollution. But it is also related to David's case. How this relates is one of the great revelations of the movie. Weir does not succeed in creating an atmosphere of fear and oppression that represents future horrors without really showing anything. Charles Wain's score is fantastic, especially the Didgeridoo. Photography is also very good. Russell Boyd, Weir's long-standing DP, who won an Oscar for Master and Commander in 2004, shows a dark, creepy world of mystery. <br /> <br /> I also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on the aborigines, do not indulge in white culture or in a juicy celebration of their traditions, such as Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai, don't change. This movie is too clever to be so simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it can upset viewers who expect to make a movie with everything that makes sense; But for those who don't mind a little bit of strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
