Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to shut it down. While sitting there for the next 10 minutes, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and comic attitude made me shake my head about why he wasn't in more comedies. He did this "Marty Feldman" thing for him, but many, much more talent ... nothing to take from Marty. The movie really shocked me about how close it was to the original Jerk, but then it was so much more. I really think if this movie was first released and I saw the Steve Martin movie 2, I think the 2nd was a cheap rip-off. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but that's true. I actually like Steve Martin, but his performance is 2nd for the actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. I urge you to see it if you can find it.
