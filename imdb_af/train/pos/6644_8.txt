After too many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons' famous 1979 book The House Next Door is finally filmed. The result is a bit of the novel that is understandable especially in the first story of the trilogy if it is unsatisfactory because it is a TV movie that absorbs everything and is actually very good, just as big as the book, one of Stephen King's favorites and one of me too. <br /> <br /> With more run time and less restrictions than a theater release, all the wealth inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous state-of-the-art home could be explored and followed, especially the climax revelation near the end. <br /> <br /> However, the whole role plays well in this thoughtful story of sensible injustice. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of anxiety is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes is an abstract painting of the house by its neighboring amateur artist who tries to visualize his corruption on canvas. <br /> <br /> Make sure you read the great novel.
