A bloody gangster story that takes place in the years of Great Depression. It tells us about another notorious hit, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns the other way around: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family is dead because of his own boss's dirty play. He succeeds in his revenge and assures his son's honorable future, but is eventually killed. Such stories never end happy. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Salliwan senior was played wonderfully by Tom Hanks, and part of Mr. Rooney (the Mafia boss) was executed by Paul Newman. The film makes a good impression, and we hear the famous phrase "we rob banks". This movie is still worth watching, although you could expect something from Sam Mendes after his American beauty.
