Many Zorro films have been made over the decades, but it is a pity that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro movies. First, it is a republican series in 12 chapters. And this time Zorro is not played by a top studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but rather by workman actress Reed Hadley. While Hadley is not so much present about the proceedings as the others, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the only hero here; As the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the area is not California. The story takes place in central Mexico in 1824, where a man who acts as a living God attacks the indigenous Indian people and a group of exiles to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredible cheesy moment per episode audio effects acting too ridiculous. But overall, it represents one of the best republican rallies of all time, and probably the best Zorro one. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most magazines and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering. And there are lots of fantastic action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will get a few pieces from this series.
