Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle who has a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and destroys wreckage. Carrey is back in familiar soil and looks good to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his gift to the girl is also charming and influenced. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the movie (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is awesome and makes the movie worth catching. GRADE: B
