This move was hilarious !!! Funniest thing I've seen for a while, akshay and John kick ass as always, and the chicks are also hot. The story is wonderful, very good jokes, and anyone who reviewed it before me is an idiot. to him I say that you are not of the Indian background, so you will not understand the humor. Don't judge movies you don't understand. what did you look at, the caption version where most jokes are lost in translation? That's what I thought Jackass was. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves his versatility, he can not only do action but also comedy and is excellent on it. John also proved himself, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent on it.
