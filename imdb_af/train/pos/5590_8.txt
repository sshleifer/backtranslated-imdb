(No need to recreate the plot, as others have already done so.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find fault with the movie, as we do with the slam-scared sensurround of today's cineplex experience. Against this background, it seems that a movie like Ecstasy has flown from another planet. I think there are several worthy reasons why. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film unfolds poetically as the camera slowly overflows around the surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc. Moving, which is a tranquil and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the husband and wife into his fold. Together, it shows a style and dimension that is almost completely lacking in today's technology-driven theater, where fast fireworks distract the attention of the audience and not concentrate. In addition, the story is transmitted by eye and not by the ears, with almost no dialogue to explain what is going on. It comes down to another extreme departure from today's very literal rate, where visual arts only look like they raise the audience. But perhaps most disturbing - the movie is sometimes quite silent, not in the sense that silent movies are quiet, as we expect them to be. But in the sense that the characters rarely speak when we expect it. So the burden of the story is shared between the film maker and the viewer. The former must artificially choose his artworks to convey the narrative, while the latter has to think of the footage, as it will not be explained. <br /> <br /> None of these are meant to lower today's film. -making. It's just to point out that a movie like Machaty's comes from a very different aesthetic than we have today. I do not claim it will be better or worse. However, I argue that Ecstasy represents a perspective that is very much lacking in today's movie experience, where such contemplative values ​​are routinely dismissed as slow and dull. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not a masterpiece, although it sometimes reaches artistic heights, such as the beautifully crafted beer garden scene with its final crane that pops up to reveal the beautiful table top below. The slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature and rebirth are also splendidly expressed. These are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you, but instead - given half the chance - are quietly awakened in an experience like memorable a "jaw". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie is sometimes heavy-handed, such as when Machaty stacks on the images, especially in the final, ode-to-work sequence. It's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence. Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that has hard work for the love-wage hero and people in general - a theme that is then promoted by the influential Soviet theater. Yet his presence here is rather boring. <br /> <br /> In any case, I must admit that I initially agreed to see the beautiful Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that I had a lot more in the process than just a snoek skirt in the forest.
