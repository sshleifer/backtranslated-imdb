As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit this one. The plot isn't really that bad, but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself, "What's the gate here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make it the funniest thing. bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore became so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects exist to speed up the battle scenes to double. There are also scenes where there is a quick reaction to the scene, jumping on a ten foot high wall (by falling back), naked men who go out of big letters and sex that literally brings the roof down (with the cable that roof on fire). <br /> <br /> Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie would be complete without a completely free and random comedy club scene where Rudy is interested in all the customers. do a little strange dance. There are so many things bad about this movie, but it is bad in an entertaining way, and if you look your eyes off the movie, you might miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for real value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for tracking errors and goofs, averages up to 7/10.
