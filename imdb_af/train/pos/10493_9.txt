This movie is inspiring for anyone in a difficult jam, whether financial or emotional. You'll definitely laugh, what's the best medicine! :) In a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace needs to find a new way to earn money and this is not exactly legal, resulting in humor. Even my boyfriend loved it so much, don't think it's a movie.
