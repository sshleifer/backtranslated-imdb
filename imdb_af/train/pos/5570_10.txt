Sophmoric is this movie. But it's funny when everyone comes out. It shows that the boys locker mentality is played by the other side. It is good to see such tides turning and how stupid they are. But it's probably not news for most women, because (just ask one), "they've heard it before." <br /> <br /> Watch it with a small group or party of mixed sex and 97.3% of the room will be straight for 2 hours. And the other 2.7% ... can you ever really please them?
