THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, it's not 2001, but it's not meant to be. And the acting and mini-dissertation here are not even aware of other Arnie movies like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I suggest that the IDEA behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are not equipped with no one) to satisfy the public's desire for sport and blood. The ultimate prize for a winner: freedom. Or so the rules require. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such over-the-top gory death scenes and cheesy one-liners, it has a lot to say. Someone else has pointed out all the culture / government commentaries presented in this movie, so I'm not going into this. It's enough to say that if you can watch outside the seemingly stupid feeling of the movie, you'll enjoy it (especially if you're a big SF fan with lots of imagination). As I said, it doesn't try to be a serious movie, but it is surprisingly low for an 80-year-old shoot-em-up flick. The premise is borrowed from a short novel by Richard Bachman (also known as Stephen King), but differs quite strongly from his source material, especially at the end. (The book ends rather nihilistically; it is unnecessary to say that this movie is not.) I both enjoyed, but I like the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Guess it is caused by steroids."
