Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore having seen a large number of these movies, it is rare that I consider myself totally unique. For that matter, it is just as rare that I breathe through the laughs during several screens. The love story is a little thin on the ground, but I say it's probably the best, as this romantic comedy emphasizes the emphasis on "comedy", and yet it limits the limits of credibility a little more than I do of most rom coms to do. The four scientists have not only offered the funniest moments in this film, but in any movie I've seen for a long time. I cried for the shortest moments before finally choosing a "9" over a "9" as a rating, as I believe too many people are using it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating is losing its impact. I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan, who helps, but it's one of the few movies I've seen in which I want to say she's been extensively overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are thrown as the clues, but for me the second is playing for the antics of the clumsy intellectuals. A real, extremely hard movie.
