It's a movie to be seen by everyone if you want to see good acting. Mr. Torn and me Farrel do an excellent job. I think they should have it on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> It gives you a real sense of what the pioneers had to do physically and emotionally. Great unheard of movie. <br /> <br /> This was done when me. Hail was very young. I always thought of her as a comedian, but it's certainly not a comedy and she's just wonderful. There are many small dialogues, but it just makes it more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence and only his breathing has a good feeling. I need to see the movie.
