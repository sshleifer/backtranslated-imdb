I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. Would highly recommend :) ... I just love Brazilian soaps, they are about real life events. I'm very sad that the soap has ended, but I'm sure I'll find it somewhere. For those of you who haven't seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how it eventually turned out for the villains. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long life love. I can't wait to see it again and strongly recommend it. Xica is by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) Go XICA .. Hope you all love it too.
