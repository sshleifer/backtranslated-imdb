La Maman et la Putain should be viewed as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (after-68) and eternal in many ways. True, the actors don't "act" ... They talk a lot ... But what they're talking about is just what life makes life worth living ... or dying. The very long monologue spoken by Fran√ßoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text ever written about femininity, masculinity and love. It is not easy to translate accurately. This movie is a statement about the trouble of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Leud is one of the greatest French actors.
