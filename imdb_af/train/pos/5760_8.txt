My roommate ordered this one from the web for a while and I eventually died to watch it. It's gross. This is cheezy. It's pretty stupid ... but it's also fun. I mean, it was most fun to see a movie like this since 'City Of The Walking Dead' ages ago. It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater again! You can keep the guy who made this movie out of all the horrified zombie movies. This one rolled all the cliches and tricks of those movies into one and it is neat because it is SUPPOSE to be so. The cheeze factor is high, the gore flows and the laugh rolls! The effects go from messy to good, with the one where the man is torn in hell and the one where a man gets his heart is pushed through his chest, both excellent! The acting goes from terrible to really pretty good. There is not much plot, just many and many. This one is pattern to the zombie movies from Italy and Spain, I think, because they are forever holding the gross scenes, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, cold B-grade stuff, then you can't look at this one wrong. A great way to waste a Friday night!
