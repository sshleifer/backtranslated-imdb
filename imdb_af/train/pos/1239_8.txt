I think the movie was pretty good, it will add to my "classic collection" after all this time. I believe I've seen other posters reminding some of the voters that it's just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points will explain "logic", but a large number of religious matters accepted on faith fail to test the smell. If you accept any faith you enter, you can definitely accept a movie. It's just me or someone else who has noticed that the Aja-Yee dagger is the same. Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble getting control in "The Shadow". No mention in the trivia section for any movie here (IMDB), but I will bet a dollar to a donut, it's the same prop.
