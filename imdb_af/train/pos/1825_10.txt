I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really liked. It wasn't an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years, I decided to look at it again and see if it was just nostalgic or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie kept me expecting. It's a good movie. Emotionally in the right amount, a few jokes, nice songs (not big, and it really explains why I didn't remember it was a musical) and everything in my best time. I was surprised that the last movies from my childhood that I reviewed did not even pass my minimal demands on a decent movie and yet this movie I first saw in the second grade made me cry today, just like it made me cry. . Perhaps this is because my dog ​​has recently died and maybe not, but the important thing is that it makes me feel, and therefore filmmakers make movies (that and the money of course). Yes, there are continuity differences. Yes, the writing has holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is fun and clever. So don't be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for the bad things in life because nothing is perfect, and this movie doesn't get a 10 because it's perfect. It gets 10 just because it made me feel.
