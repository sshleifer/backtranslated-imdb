I really love this movie, see it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, good directing / camera work / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. sorry, jaco van dormael didn't make movies anymore. Top 5 work. Really! <br /> <br /> Today it is 3 years and 3 days later than the comments above. It was never uploaded because it was no more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw yesterday's "super humor" again. This is undoubtedly in my movie top 3. with "Cinema Paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I'm really curious about "jaco von dormael's" new movie. I hope it will complete my movie top 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you want to see it again.
