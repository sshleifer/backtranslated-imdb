I recently bought the collection one of these wonderful series, and even after watching only three episodes, I am still fascinated by the sleek styling of the animation and the slow, yet thoughtful storytelling action. I'm still a fan ..... with some little pain. <br /> <br /> Although this installment in the Gundam saga is very cool and has had the previous series - an attractive satirical way of telling the injustices. of war and not releasing the need to have control over everything (sounds familiar?), I must say that this one becomes a bit too mellow-dramatic to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need for abdominal pains everything that happens and what they have to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially called the character Wufei ... I mean that he blows more than an American character on a soap opera advisor, do you want ?) Except for the exaggerated drama (I think it mostly comes from the doubling of the English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will captivate me again. I mean it can always be worse. It might be like the recent installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about mellow dramatic .... I'll talk about one later.
