In what is a really diverse cast, this show hits it on FOX. It's the kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you only watch one show, you can't keep it that much, but if you look once or twice, you become addicted. <br /> <br /> This is because some of the jokes have hit and some miss depending on how you see it. As usual, the themes are very mature. The humor is usually mature as well. Often, the most funny parts are those where the adult themes clash with the innocent. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) a veteran actor does a very good killing-type humor on this show. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this ensemble cast. Danny Masterson, the eldest actor of the "kids", is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in previous shows as a natural redhead (who had the idea of ​​making her a blonde?). She shows very good talent and comic timing. She also looks good without getting it up. <br /> <br /> This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom section. This is the most successful live action since Married With Children
