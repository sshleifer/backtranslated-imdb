Curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused, irritated and scared. The creaking old plot of a ghost train that runs through the lonely English countryside at night, may be unreasonable, but it is a pleasure. There are some wonderful old cliches like "THE ACCIDENT" that the residents can remember, but will not speak. But especially the film is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to portray his distinctive brand of vaudeville style humor between the horrible pieces. Askey's corny humor is not very trendy these days, but if you were just about it, it could be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's movies.
