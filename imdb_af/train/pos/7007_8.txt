From the first scene you get clues about what's going on here. This is becoming increasingly obvious as the story rolls. The acting is excellent and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was very surprised at the motive. I'm still mysterious about why Ben did what he did. We could see "second thoughts" in his face, but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to be against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and pleasant story, but it got me confused. Maybe it was the point of the movie. I did like the movie and Wil Smith can still choose a good movie. This man knows how to entertain an audience!
