This movie has great style, fantastic visual and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. It falls to the end as the story turns a little extreme. But all in all, I would recommend this movie just because it has such a good old Russian feel. Great, impressive, powerful, dark and cruel and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A man who can shoot a blade out of his hand (not a spoil because they show it in the trailer) when he is VERY angry if you want a girl . He discovers that after killing one person with your sword, it's hard to keep a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> A heavy boy is on the planet for a reason. He just doesn't know what it is. NO. <br /> <br /> Many dark street battles with guys unexpectedly filtered creatively. <br /> <br /> RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles .. slick worth a watch ..
