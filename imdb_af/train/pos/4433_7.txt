The story: On the island of Texel, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for life enters Bob, who had previously experienced a very traumatic experience. But her life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Can Kathleen win his confidence? <br /> <br /> Overview: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds well, although it remains a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's "psychology" would have been " a little more worked out. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? It gives a film depth and something to think in my opinion. The story never reaches an emotional climax, though the characters are enough to justify it. So you don't know the characters on the deeper level. The actors do good work and play in a very natural and "credible" way, but I think that would have played the movie better if Kathleen was played by a younger actress, as this character's naivety doesn't work for an adult. no. up woman. Camera work is nice, and there are some great shots of nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.
