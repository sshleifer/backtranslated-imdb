The origin of this movie is a mystery to me, because I know as much as IMDB did before renting it. I assume that for "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the myriad of unaired pilots who never made the network, cable or otherwise. The new title "Kill Shot" is separated in the opening order, the first of many quick clues, that it was never meant for the theater. The quick cuts, cheesy "Melrose Place" music and short 2-second sincere shots of the lead players let you know what you're interested in. <br /> <br /> And I don't care about everyone. I rented this movie because the repackaging that Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards put on the front of a volleyball net, would think it would be funny to watch them in a movie, except the Starship Troopers SciFi crossover (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but it's another review). After looking at IMDB, my roommate and I suspect the pilot was towed to the apparent success of Troopers and Richard's own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They cast a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the prestigious R-rated status - prestigious video rental departments. In any case, they should have left it unobstructed if you try to sell it in the suspense / softcore porn section. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's entertaining. I hate having fun telling it it's a TV pilot. It was the biggest draw while you watch it - if you expect a movie and get a TV show, the differences between them will make them clearer than usual. <br /> <br /> Would I rent it again? No. Will I watch this TV show? Well why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their efforts to capture all the demographics would have done well in the mid-90s. Token Black guy (who is gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating), token Asian (Japanese, I accept from Koji) more proficient for science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina pre-med student who does everything for her except her family's bank account - this show will probably have done well. <br /> <br /> But as a movie it just breaks me. <br /> <br /> I got it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it had to be forced. It made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask for rent.
