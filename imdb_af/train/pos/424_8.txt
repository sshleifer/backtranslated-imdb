I love this movie because I grew up. Pat Boone behind the sulky reminds me of my dad who was pulled to the trotters because, unlike adult jockeys, men of normal height and weight may be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 home in Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, a good movie. (Disappointing though Pat Boone's religious / moral views have forbidden him to ever kiss the girl!) A change of today's standard rate.) In Indiana with Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white without any hint that someone ever had a song will burst) take the stress and struggle to make the eventual performance more satisfying, but it requires a greater emotional investment.
