I saw one day two days ago and today I saw part two. Of course, the two parts are worlds apart, so I'm slightly shaken by everything I just saw. I experienced the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; for me it ruined the whole movie. I think that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slow inevitable inevitability of his death. Part two was so limp compared to, again, an inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia have only been highlighted, but are rarely confronted with didactics. To me, the memorable scenes at the end of the film were: the confrontation with the jailer and the milder conversation with the Bolivian official where that official asked Che for the failure of the farmers to support his revolution. I didn't think the national differences were playing as much role as they did in the conflict, Argentina against Bolivia. I thought Soderbergh was doing great with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without harming the farmers who do not have enough? I was hit by how difficult it would be to try something like Che tried. I think it's all in the timing; is there enough anger against the government to start the movement; there was no Bolivia. Che has read the horrific corundum of revolutionists in his letter to Fidel at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, 50 years from now. A very thought-provoking and well-filmed film; make every effort to see it.
