a little slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a solid role character like the postman, the brothers sitting on the stoep, the rich cigar smoke man. The photography of the river is wonderful, just like the interior decoration. If you like Banana Republic shops, it's a must.
