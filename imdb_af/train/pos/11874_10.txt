Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, a small-cap from Cuba has become a rich and powerful criminal in Miami. He does it with the only two things he has in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break 'em for anyone. Start working for a big Cuban trader, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), and get on with his long-time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he had an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank's threat to Tony's position, he's trying to grab Tony, but with no success. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. The film has a major supporting role, among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumping gangster. Another well-known face is Harris Yulin as a keen man trying to shake off Tony, with Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent script by Oliver Stone. This movie is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his long and run, you can see this man is very talented. The movie has a beautiful view. Also note two memorable scenes: One at the fancy restaurant ("Good night for the bad man"). The other is the last shooting Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kill about 20 killers who invaded his home. It's definitely one of the most impressive endings to a movie I've ever seen. For Al Pacino fans and crime movies, this is a must see. It is highly recommended for the rest of you. 10/10
