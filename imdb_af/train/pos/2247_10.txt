I am disappointed with the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film. Jordi Mollà, probably known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's "Blow", writing, director and stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give away bullet points, because the movie (at least for me) was very exciting because I didn't know about it. If you have a netfix fix or have access to a video store that would carry it ... I strongly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun, and sometimes many mind-like creation. <br /> <br /> Mollà's direction is * very * impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with wonderful images and a great leadership achievement spoken in the beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie", is a wonderful movie that you can show your friends. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS.
