Hopefully the score has now been changed because of my brilliant and beautiful review that will make you all watch the movie and create a kits of "8" s, the movie's real score. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is the king! Previously to see this movie, I wasn't over the top of him, but now I hit the doors of Chris Rock's website and beg him to take me as his protein. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this movie funny, you really need therapy and it is humorous in all areas of society, including race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, up comedy. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, there was one slight disappointment to me. It was that in this film I didn't realize that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait" another reasonably good film made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to look like an older movie I watched on TV a few weeks ago. Whatever this movie is, in my opinion, the better version of the two of them, simply because the different areas cover it and the fact that Chris Rock is more funny than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Well, to the real plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't spoil the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just look for a movie, because there were two more reviews on IMDb that were surprised at it, because it is the funniest thing you have seen in the past, as it is a theatrical experience. It doesn't leave you a breathtaking breath on the cost of movie tickets. Go see it because it's a good movie!
