As many reviewers have noted here, the movie difference is quite different from the stage version of the story. I have never seen the stage version of the story, and so I have a better view of the movie than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the movie is still an entertaining version of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer Michael Douglas's show. The film does it right by choosing no known actors or artists to get into the final try-out group. In this way, our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggle as they unfold during a marathon day of tasting. Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part. Apparently, some songs were cut out in favor of a new one, and the background clich√©-famous story of a romantic link between a dancer and the choreographer was added. In all fairness I must say it was the worst part of the movie. The repeated invasions that Cassie made during trials seem to be the almost desperate pleas that one often has to make when engaging in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or happiness. However, this aspect of the movie has been killed in the past and it is curious to see that this tired old shoe kicks his heel again. The revelations of the dancers themselves promisingly started with the "I can do it" number, but then it posted a bit at several points while the dancers told their stories. Honestly, their stories differ little from real people who never get such a chance. *** of 4 stars.
