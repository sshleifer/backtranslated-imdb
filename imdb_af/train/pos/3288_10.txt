This is a cool cool movie. One of my faves, it's really that cool. The director is Bernard Rose who will lead Candyman. He made a good start to this movie. <br /> <br /> The film about a girl named Anna who gets sick with glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house really is. Every subsequent dream she has is changed by the presence of everything she adds to the picture. In her third dream she met a boy she thought she called Mark. She is friendly to him and their relationship grows stronger as the dreams become darker and scarcer. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a great actress and it is very strange that she should just disappear after one movie and never be anything again. She really gives a good performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's count is also baited. Like the Broken Arrow, the music is haunting and mysterious. It's a pity that the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
