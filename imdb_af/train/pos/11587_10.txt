I absolutely love this movie and really want it. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I love it and want to see it again! I don't remember it too much, but a native American boy lives in a pretty village with his family and I don't remember what happens, but he has to go to the desert alone. His sister packs him and he goes. While he was there, a few other Indian boys came out and sat down a few feathers on him, and he became an eagle. The legend says if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it's the boy. I was always fascinated by legends, especially native American legends, and I would love to see it released on a DVD sometime, PLEASE PLEASE, anyone who's worried!
