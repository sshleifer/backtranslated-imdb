Also known as the Big Ghost War. The Great Yokai War is Miike's attempt to make a family film and the good work he does. The problem is that I can't imagine that many parents want to submit their children to this movie. The best children's movies are those that are frightening, or give a light disturbing image, Neverending Story and Return to Oz, but in the case of the Great Yokai war, Miike is probably taking a little too far. In fact, at the show I was with the person who repeated the film to the two families. It was probably not very suitable. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the young hero of the piece who introduces himself and explains about his current family problems. This short moment of eternity is sharply broken as a cow gives a calf with the face of a man shouting that something terrible comes before he falls dead as the abomination is (it is quite possible that the mere concealment of the creature is bizarre Quato tribute). <br /> <br /> Following an apocalyptic army, is an incredible introduction to chief sister Kato, and his henchwoman Agi (a surprisingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami). The story usually returns for a while, but it doesn't take long, and all the logic will be in the drain and the young boys reject teams with a Miyazaki group to take out the evil wizard. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is pretty basic and sometimes surprisingly snapped, the whole chosen one just looks completely out of place in a movie that breaks so often, but is supported by a simple awesome vision of a magical world. It's really a Miyazaki movie made in a live action movie, though a lot of seed and more fierce than the usual Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply a joy to watch the design of the Yokai, and largely practical, while the evil robot monsters, while not displaying the best CGI in the world, are a practical and Threat to them which gives them much more of a tangible threat than you might think. <br /> <br /> The cast is uniformly excellent, they just make their characters look completely natural, which is commendable if you think most of them are in full body or latex packs. Even Agi, who is cut with a ridiculous beehive, comes across as sultry and deadly, thanks to Kuriyami's surprisingly outstanding acting. <br /> <br /> While the film has many elements that place it firmly in the family movie area; cute creatures, junior heroes, a thorough evil villain, a sense of evil and adventure and a lack of violence. There are elements that let you know if Miike had had such a movie. <br /> <br /> The Robot Defense is a really frightening threat to everyday items being turned into monsters that look like T-101 sans skin and with additional chain saws. These animals rip characters into pieces; suck creatures into their blood-colored mouth, and kidnap children from their homes by wiping them right under their parents' noses before entering a little patricide. <br /> <br /> The creation of the creature is equally difficult for young minds. The Yokai, essentially the heroes, fills in a giant furnace of a liquidated form of hatred rusting the Yokai's flesh and forcing their evil souls to possess lumps of metal. If the children thought that Anakin was smoldering, there were bad waits until they saw a man's big hedgehog killed in a little cast hatred for a moment before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle. There is also limb separation, in one case a cut hand pull in front of the camera with blood drop, a good amount of sexual energy. (Agi wears a dress specifically designed for fan service and apparently just sleeps with Kato as motivation, while the Princess of Rivers carries nothing less and gets her thighs through the young hero in various scenes) and general humor right across the heads of those who wonder this technique column are apparently designed. <br /> <br /> Spoilers An example of this is that the Yokai is only interested in the final battle when they think it's a great festival. The subsequent battle more of a feast than anything, complete with beer, crowd surfing and moshing. Also, a scene where Agi hits the tar from a cute, fiery creature seems to be calling on the masses fed by Pokemon remains. <br /> <br /> End Spoilers At the end of the day The Great Yokai War is easy on Miike's stronger recent movies. While lacking the perverse charm of saying Gozu or Ichi is lacking, it just pushes the audience on a path of general insanity. In fact, it's easily Miike's most ferocious movie by completely embracing the sheer magic of the subject. <br /> <br /> Just to find a watch, just for the occasional flash of Gogo ass.
