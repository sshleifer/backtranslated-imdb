If you experience problems, you may give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this movie wasn't made to please everyone, <br /> <br /> Just people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For those people, the movie is great! It plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows are far away, most of the witch where B-rated. Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2 you have to stretch your imagination a bit to get the jokes, but it's worth it.
