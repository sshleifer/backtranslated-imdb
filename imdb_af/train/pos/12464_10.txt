Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - what can you ask for? Based on the award-winning novel of the same name, Monkey Grip explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother who falls for heroin addict Jobe (Friels)). A simple story is truly made extraordinary by the all-round wonderful play (especially Noni Hazlehurst) and fine use of the small budget, the only mistake (if you can pick it up) is that the story is set in Melbourne, but for the budget reasons the movie was shot mainly in Sydney, so as a result, in a few scenes You see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then a Carlton post office (Sydney scenes). Unlike that, Monkey Grip is a must see (excuse the click, but it is) at least for an award-winning performance of the previous "Play School" and "Better Homes & Gardens" presenter Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
