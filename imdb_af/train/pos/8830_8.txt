This is a masterpiece of footage in B / W 35mm film. The movie makes you a strange way to start the day at 07:35 in a bar and how many things can happen in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The short incredible, gets you into a complex story using very few elements, and step by step makes you realize that something is not quite right. It speaks a lot, makes your adrenaline high with subtle details, and is incredibly understandable by anyone, not just the film critics experts. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and low budget. Don't let that scare you. Is really worth seeing through someone, not just experts in the genre. <br /> <br /> Isn't really more to tell, as the movie lasts just 8 minutes (exactly) and I don't want to spoil it. But I just watched it online and I couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes commenting on it. <br /> <br /> It's really worth seeing. 10/10.
