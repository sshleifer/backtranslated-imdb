How powerful and captivating simple movie filming can be. This film tells it is the story of everyday scenes that alleviates the poignancy inside. This is where others have said, how this movie really makes it clear, how lost Hollywood is in its special effects, remaining emotionalism and over the top regions and forgets the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism. So much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in a contemporary dialogue. One aspect I really enjoy the movie was the contrast of the two brothers, one so openly expressive in his childlike way and the other totally stoic, but both can evoke deep emotion. The older brother had to say little, as he usually did, it was all there in that deadly face of her! Beautiful cinema, great play, good direction! Not to be missed!
