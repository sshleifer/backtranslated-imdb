I'm definitely not in the target audience for this movie. I'm a man nearly 50 who just stumbled across the world of independent film. It happened quite accidentally, with the discovery of a movie Clerks that was late night on television. The first two things I noticed about the movie were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to get interesting. When he said that his starring role was The Station Agent, a movie I watched on DVD for a week, I decided to go and watch. The result can be described in the same way as Clerks, although the two films are nothing in content. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome by wonderful writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing at all in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who is apparently forcing himself to be constantly busy Being, he always runs somehow and fills his life with little things so he will never have to go with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this movie are strong and attractive. I can tell that I didn't see much change since I grew up, but young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer calls these issues and themes into the modern language, crafting wonderful honest characters, and has completely credible things. Regarding indie cinema, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic one it is very close.
