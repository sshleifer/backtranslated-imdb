A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Every time you come across a movie that really touches a nervous. This one offers a very simple starting point, practically flawless in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It's surprising that Ettore Scola's "Una giornate particulare" is relatively irrevocable, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it 'rubbish' and Leonard Maltin, a little milder, 'pleasant, but small.' I disagree, not only because this film is moving deeply, but in its simple story, it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most movies I saw. The cinematography is clearly unbearable, even a bit dull, and the storyline is straightforward, which can explain the film's relative unpopularity. In the light of the late 70's not only spoiled with great Italian movies, it's even stranger. This one didn't really catch up with the critics. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a ten-minute collage of archival material From Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. Against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, loving housewife with six children in a Roman apartment. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who apparently is just one in the building who doesn't attend the ceremonies. He is well mannered, cultivated and soon she is attracted. During the entire film, we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge reception through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, the camera swings over the courtyard of the modernist (modern-day) apartment block, which is apparently looking for our main characters we haven't met yet. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles, all the more surprising as they are completely thrown at type. Canadian-born John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but he's just on the screen in the first and last scene. I have shown his voice to be baptized as he is not of Italian descent and never lived there, so I can't think he speaks Italian. If his voice was baptized, I didn't know at all. On the contrary, he is completely credible as Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are outstanding, the end is just perfect and the framework doesn't come out as overly pretentious, but works completely. Do not miss this one. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
