One of the all-time great science fiction works, as visionary and enticing as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but he is exaggerated by Pitt's incredible frenetic turn that is different from what he did before or before. Even Stowe is not out of her league here. The story is very low and offers quite a bit to think about. The climatic scene is beautifully beautiful, and the last lines fit perfectly. The screens in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Very dark humor on the screen here. Fantastic production design and appropriate bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.
