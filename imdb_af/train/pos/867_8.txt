As in Amelie, recent French films seem to be a stereotypical relationship between husband and wife, based on a female woman based on her one true love. In this case, despair leads to a culprit, leading to her evolution in a mob prototype. Clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the woman is there to support the man. <br /> <br /> For those of us who don't speak French, the captions are a bit quick, but not unreasonable. br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which is apparently increasingly the case with European films, is great and in perfect synchronization with the film's variations. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of several urban horror movies. There's a West Craven in Chicago.
