Does anyone know where this movie was shot? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the Brill building, with its fascinating elevators. Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I sank, but I never saw him. Maybe he was the man's lawyer, but again, I don't remember the character being in the movie, except that it is called as a call. Maybe he was in the aviation scene? Or the ballroom scene? Did anyone get him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film.
