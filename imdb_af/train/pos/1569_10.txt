I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Wafel are cats so different from each other, but they collectively refer to themselves as "brothers." I often try to imitate the tired, sucking accent of their butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish town of Gordon. More episodes must be made about Human Kimberly. The episode about the cats who disguised themselves as pre-teen girls getting access to Human Kimberly's slumber party to get their thirsty legs on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We can't drink rootbear in our home without making the Catscratch voices or the Hanson Brothers of the Slap Shot movie. Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
