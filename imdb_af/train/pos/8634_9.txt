LOVE BO - the completely wrong American title for the wonderful French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that it dates back to 1974 looks all the more amazing. This film was far from his time; Even at today's highest standards, it achieves things that look rich and new. Filmed by the amazingly understated director Michel Deville, it rather damages description in the way it combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into one totally original mix. It finally made a big but subtle surprise to have done everything before suddenly sad and understandable. The film is beautiful, also the writing and theme. But it is Deville's wonderful tone, which constantly balances you, but it is harnessed, which indeed pushes this "lost" movie to a very high level. (The written interview with the director on the Special Features section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have the time.)
