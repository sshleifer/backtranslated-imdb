A very good movie and true story. Then Jansen the Greatest skater ever. A touch and beautiful movie that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens battle with cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. From an important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister, Jane was ready to believe in his talent that speed skating was justified. This photo is worth it. I wish they would make more movies of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with great actors and a great story. It's a very enjoyable story about beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and sister.
