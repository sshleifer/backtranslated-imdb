I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and reviewed the reviews at IMDb. I was worried about a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, of course, were actually quite humorous, almost like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I don't see it as a bad movie. It's not a good movie either. Just a pretty well made horror movie. It doesn't rely much on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the play was OK. Sarah did a very good job, pretty convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad, or I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are exactly the same as in Japanese original use). <br /> <br /> The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I've seen quite an abomination, and I didn't expect to be scared, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails, the simple special effects for his ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat who made cheerful sounds, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, as it's much different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you just want to watch movies that Oscar wins. It's a good horror movie, enough tension. I gave it a 7.
