I liked a lot about this movie. I saw the original classic a few times, but could hardly remember any details. I think this movie is much better than the cartoon, it's not as black and white as it is. I especially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and a cause why he was the way he was. The villain in this movie was not the real Grinch, but the Major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was a great film made for the whole piece for both kids and adults.
