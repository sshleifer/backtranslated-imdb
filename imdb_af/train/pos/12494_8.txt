Finally, an indie movie that is really alarming! I see most horror movies coming out ... Theater, Straight-to-DVD, cable, etc ... and most of them suck ... some are vigilant ... even less is actually good ... Dark Remains is one of those goodies. I caught a show of this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! If I have no name actors, I assume that the budget on this movie was pretty low, but you won't know ... the movie looks fantastic ... the acting works entirely for the movie ... the story is good ... and the terrorists are wonderful! While most filmmakers focus exclusively on frightening, they often forget story and character development, two things that help deliver the scares more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important. He both develops to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and is therefore more afraid of being in danger. <br /> <br /> Watch horror movies that cost anywhere from $ 80 million to $ 5000, "I find" Dark Remains "one of the gems out there. Check out this movie!
