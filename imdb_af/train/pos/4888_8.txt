It's just broadcast on the BBC and I'm absolutely delighted to see it. As the credits rolled, the cast alone made sure I was going to give it. After just five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was formula and predictable, but it somehow contributed to the charm. The kickbacks of the forties were wonderfully placed and made a sense in few productions. <br /> <br /> An own feel-good movie, continuously playing with outstanding music. When released, I will buy it!
