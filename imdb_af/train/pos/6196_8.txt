Fay, the sister of the notorious Nobel laureate Simon Grim, still likes Henry Fool. Their son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an unknown transmitter and a chase across three continents occurs, with a very sad collection of government agents, terrorists, pilots and bellhops. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey delivers a perfectly timely comic performance, including some brilliant physical work. With strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves in the best Billy Wilder tradition that nothing is worse than a beautiful woman in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good score by Hartley (and thanks in the credits to the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as co-fellow in the fall of 2004).
