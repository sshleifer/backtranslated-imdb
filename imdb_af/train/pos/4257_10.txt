This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great! <br /> <br /> It's not an idealistic movie, I'll say it shows life as it was or was in the 60's and 70's when the main story takes place. The characters are very nice, but they also have a few "dark" sides, which makes you believe that they are real people. Big movie with great actors to show that life is not always funny, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion" like the main character Gigi would say.
