I thought the original of this movie was beautiful and beautiful, and I sat on the edge of my seat to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the original when I saw it Sci Fi Channel - I don't know if these remakes were deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was within the first few minutes. Because I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see him pull it. <br /> <br /> The authors / producers, etc. Modernized the film by explaining the state of the "aliens" (They could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help.) With the same pseudo-science that was scratched in our ears in the 90s. Maybe it added some polish to the film, or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Film? This production did a more sinister edge than the original one. The original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the stranger, and an understanding of types has occurred, although no solution to the Alien's problem is. <br /> <br /> I remember the woman in this remake becoming quite hostile to the Burgi / Alien. I think it could have ended up better. But the end is just the end, and the thread is a swell, which is the basic 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock. Many great science fiction stories were written in the fifties and some even made it to movie. <br /> <br /> It is a swelling thing to look like a rainy day or something. I rate it highly cos of all the remakes of the old 50's Sci Fi, this one came off well. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants to tell this story, I propose the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, led by Gene Fowler Jr.
