This episode of the first season slightly down to controversy with the whole gender bend angle. I suggest there was a significant amount of editing before it was ready to saturate sensors. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and the direction is augmented by the fine acting. (Nicholas Lea made his debut of X-Files though not as Agent Krycek, but as a victim named Michael) I particularly enjoyed building and ending himself. <br /> <br /> This is different but pleasant. Ignore any bad reviews you may hear. Watch it for yourself and then fix it
