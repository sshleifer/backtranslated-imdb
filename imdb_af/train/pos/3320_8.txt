I like this movie, cute and funny. I saw this movie as a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees. You have to be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Must tell the Yankee fans. I recommend this photo to the whole family. Of course with your typical love / comedy movie, there is a long moment in the movie, with me being in love and what I do, but the movie finishes with all the slapstick moments. The movie show is a few moments of how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park) how the fans who are about 86 years of the Sox are always tied to the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and love with another person go hand in hand.
