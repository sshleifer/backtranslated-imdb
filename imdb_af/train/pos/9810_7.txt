Albuquerque is a film that contains all the elements of a Western class A, except one: the story, which really belongs to a class B or C. It was acceptable at the time of the film when people were so excited about Western in color, but nowadays it just seems very primitive. Nonetheless, for people who enjoy old westerns, it is entertaining, the original color and sound are well preserved on the recent DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lon Chaney is mean as always, and Randolph Scott is a bit more cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city, but the town shown here can only be there.
