When I first saw the Exterminators of the year 3000, I had no expectations for that movie. Although it wasn't as bad as I thought. It's a kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with throws, it's almost known in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story are Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of Zombie carnivores. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays Tommy, and you can see that child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the living dead AKA gates of hell) as John Robbins and Cannibal apocalypse as the role of Mary's brother. Very entertaining movie, with some dull parts.
