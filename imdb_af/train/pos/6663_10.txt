This movie is about a dysfunctional family, but not just a dysfunctional family. It's about the father's family of our nation (India), though the film focuses mainly on the alienated relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how the Mahatma M.K. had to kill. Gandhi, how to sacrifice his family life to reach our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son were trying to get close, the Mahatma would come between them. It's a beautiful movie. Akshaye Khanna proved himself to be a top actor. Of course, he expressed many emotions. Darshan Jariwala, who starred in Plays Gurukant Desai's lawyer in Guru, portrayed Gandhi wonderfully. (As a real Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God), Shefali Shah has also done a great job for Monsoon Wedding's girl. to show how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film touches and so is his soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" sung in a very unique way. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (it was a day earlier on 2nd in Dubai) and when the movie was there was "Pin Drop Silence" and while I was coming out of the Theater, one person did not have another print no. don't push us Indians?) Not one! There was a Holy Silence ...
