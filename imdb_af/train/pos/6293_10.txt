Buster absolutely excels in this episode, which is the only vehicle I saw until the end of the career that allowed him to make the physical (and quiet!) Comedy that made him known. It's still a shock to hear his rough voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I don't give, as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to speak is still unmatched . He even repeated a few of the gags used in his early two-rule with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest thanks to Rod Serling for presenting this episode, and giving Buster's brilliant full range. He didn't have much time (one episode) to do it, but it is a special tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
