Another funny and fast-paced action thriller, which Jamie Foxx has as a fearless, fast paced, chosen by a much-demanding US Treasury agent (David Morse) to be released on New York's streets picky computer thief. hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and shot two guards. <br /> <br /> "Ace" indicates the sophomore feature of Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the job quite well, although it is not his first movie. What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are excellently excellent. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is initially annoying, but in the movie I started catching up. Hutchinson is wonderful as the master brain who can be indifferent to John Malkovich and patient as late Laurence Olivier was in the "Marathon Man". Morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get those who did it at all costs.
