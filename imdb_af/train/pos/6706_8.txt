I remember this show as it was watching Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl who enters with her aunts, which is like witches and she is one. So, Sabrina must learn how to control and effectively use the powers of power. She also has to deal with an evil rival, Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle. <br /> <br /> The show was funny and entertaining. It held on Saturday nights for a 10 year old boy. And he made a loud laugh ... And flirting with "Libby" ...
