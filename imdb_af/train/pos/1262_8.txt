A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is being sentenced to death. Sean Connery plays the "happy go lucky" lawyer, whose grandmother's grandmother retired and pleads to tackle the case in the hope of freeing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well-involved in the case and is hell-bent on exposing a theory that Connery can pick up to try and free the boy he and the entire police department are guilty of. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee, and the Late Lynne Thigpen co-star in this very intense dramatic thriller.
