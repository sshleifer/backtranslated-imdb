Misfits at a military school? Hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the sex crazy teen, the clever mouth, the pot smoker, and not to forget, the man who burns things. Throw a strict nonsense Sergeant, a gay Sergeant and one sexy ammunition teacher and make one crazy movie adventure. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie and it's funny because the comedy is reversed that if you try to work together, things are done. <br /> <br /> This group of misgit students at Weinberg Military School has been placed here because, as Sgt Liceman quotes, "because you are wiped out, embarrassment to your families and communities, shame." One of Ralph Macchio's earlier appearances The Karate Kid and My Nous Vinny, with performances by Barbara Bach, also appeal to teenagers and young adults. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack keeps the movie.
