I like this movie because it is a fine work of the theater, made by people who care about making art and not just home movies. It's filled with Super Surfer Greg Noll's home movies, and an amateur video bootload of others that align themselves with his 50-year passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the extent that it approaches nestetic glory. It's filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, no matter how trivial, is to be athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. They are also not surgeons (perhaps) or PhDs (again maybe). It believes in the search for the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace arising from the end of the war. Surfers celebrate the strike of war on the northern shore of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It celebrates the silence of a country that is carrying a cold war - instead of a hot war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only slightly historical. I suspect Alexander the Great will not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to conquer a few dozen countries and get the favorable press he received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers have a beer and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. This is the joy of exhaling.
