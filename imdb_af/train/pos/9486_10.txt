Ultimately, there is a thrill that traps the car, catches explosions and other eye. The film combines a simple plot (assassination of a French president) with an excellent backdrop. It looks at men's behavior with authorities, and explains why we will obey almost every command (even murder) given to us. <br /> <br /> We also show how secret services are managing history and how scarce they can be. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "Hollywood end" that can be easily predicted.
