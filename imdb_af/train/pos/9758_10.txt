Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! no, I'm not 10. I'm 30! I have an old, original VHS of these I bought from a rental shop. I watched it many times. <br /> <br /> While it's a great movie for kids, it's an intriguing adult movie. I once saw this movie where I was. Not sober. My eyes were opened to things I had never seen before. I have seen morals strongly encouraged, both openly and somewhat subliminally. I wish I could remember all the things I noticed, but it was a long time ago. Be assured, there are TONS of things that are shown throughout the film. if you get the chance to see it .. not sober .. do it, you will not be disappointed. In fact, you will probably feel happy and warm. <br /> <br /> unique and wonderful!
