First, an explanation about what makes me a good movie. Excitement not to know what comes next, will make me a movie the first time I see it (case and point: Twister). There are other things that make a good first impression like good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas THE MAN) , and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me a movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS band? More. That said, I offer Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch Together is excellent and very funny and / or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can't start because I don't want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch-especially if he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his choice of instruments and compositions. Very good work Jim Carrey - I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. On your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice as loud as it sounds? Sounds like an F #? It is an obscene series for a 7-year-old (obscene in the best possible way). Good work. This is the best performance of a child I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor jumped the Von Trapp Children - no small thing!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was big, funny, and surprisingly very sensitive (it really showed in his scenes with Taylor Momsen.) Taylor Momsen's unspoken expression (one of the secrets of a good acting performance) is very strong. She really gets Cindy Lou Who. And when she does dialogue, she is even stronger. <br /> <br /> **************************************************** *********** *************************** ************ ***************************** <br /> Examples: expression when she first sees the Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You're the one" and then filled in with the Grinch line "da da da THE GRINCH-which she falls into the sorter and then rescued by The Grinch). My" quote and subsequent response by The Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites the Grinch to be a holiday hunter. This scene is two excellent actors on their best interaction and Klein Taylor Momsen keeps herself completely with Jim Carrey at this place. I sincerely hope we will see Taylor Momsen in many more movies. All in all, everything was fine with this movie (except perhaps the feet and noses).
