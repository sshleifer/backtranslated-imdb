I never knew about a movie to raise such a debate in my life. Believe me if I say this movie will eventually be remembered as an all-time classic. I waited in anticipation of this movie because I previously loved both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some of the negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely loved this movie and I can't wait to see it again. This movie is completely different from both of the aforementioned Ritchie films, and also much better. I have my choice of favorite directors, but none of them pulled a move as well as Guy Ritchie just did with this movie. I believe he has taken filmmaking to another level (I know most people will laugh at these comments that will lead the reaction to this movie, but I believe that time will prove my right). This movie is very confusing and lasts much longer than the 2 hours or running time, because I couldn't stop thinking or trying to get things together. I have made a good decision about everything that happens in this movie (some answers to endless hours of thinking, some answers to read other people's movie) and now I can't wait until Sunday if I will don't see. I just hope people with an open mind go to the cinema and they will hopefully be rewarded like me and many others.
