In all the comments that Dalton's performance praised or condemned, I thought he was excellent. He does not play Rochester as a spoiled, beautiful rich boy, but as a rude, powerful man. I like this version, although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St John have never smelled. I give it a 8.
