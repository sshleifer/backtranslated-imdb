Also a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gambling. Well, martial arts; *That's pretty! And John Woo has surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining Kung Fu movie, which fights almost too much if something is possible! These are good things. <br /> <br /> Many of the fighting scenes are very good (and some are less good), and the main characters are amusing and fun. The bad guys are a little too incredibly angry, but don't entertain any less. You must see the sleep wizard! He can only fight when he is asleep - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> With repeated views, Last Hurray For Chivalry can get a bit boring and long lasting, especially as many of the fighting scenes are. not really that good. So I rate it only a 7 out of 10. But it's actually almost an "8". All in all, one of the better kung fu movies, made a smack dab in the heart. of Kung Fu Cinema's prime. All the very good kung fu movies are from the mid to late 1970s, with some notable exceptions to the late '60s and early' 70s (and early 80s, to be fair).
