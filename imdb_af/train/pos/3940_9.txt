This film was not only one of John Ford's own personal favorites, but also listed directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high-profile admirers. Ironically, I myself have trapped it myself through Criterion's recent 2-CD set, after losing some of its original language shows on Italian TV many years ago and again several times on Hollywood TV! <br /> <br /> The film marked Ford's first nine partnerships with Henry Fonda and is also a significant example of Ford's mature Americana vein. A beautifully crafted and picture-pretty poetic piece, the court-zone series (and eventual revelation) in the second half tackles quite a wall, except that stale-black character actor Donald Meek gives a memorable meat roll as the prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Of course, Fonda was perfectly cast as a bashful, inexperienced but strict and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become president; Fonda would also portray other fictional politicians on film - especially in Franklin J. Schaffner's BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising to learn that at the time he was reluctant to accept the role of Lincoln, because he said it was "like playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Ford had previously tackled Abraham Lincoln (tangential) in the PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a wonderful but perhaps little-known gem that was fortunately released only as " a special edition DVD by the UK's true Criterion stand-in, Eureka's "Masters of Cinema" label. In addition, I also have two Abraham Lincoln movies in my DVD collection I still have to watch, and in advance both are directed by DW Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) I don't just have Getting a bunch of movies I've never seen before, I'd like to give them a break from my highly satisfying viewing experience with JONG MR. LINCOLN.
