Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and wonderful movie I've seen all year. It's about a prison program somewhere in California if I remember correctly, where the prisoners each year performed another Shakespeare game. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" of the casting through performance, and in the process we learn some wonderful things about these men, who are all in the most serious crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. If someone tries to fit this story into a fictional movie, the audience will never buy it, but knowing it is really makes it awesome to watch - literally; I hastened aloud when I learned of one particularly gifted criminal crime. It's like an ugly episode of Oz, and more and more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
