Any movie that trades positively is a film still to be seen by current audiences, as the message and morale of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world of compulsory possession. <br /> <br /> Besides that, the movie is really an old-fashioned love story .. Farmer meets girl .. Boys lose girl ... Boy gets girl back .... <br /> <br /> The worst role goes to The end of Kent Smith as Lt. General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is a close second) ... my question would be how did he ever become a 3-star general ... the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, It is a wonder that they show him respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit exaggerated, and some scenes have a few holes, but generally I enjoy the movie every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red buttons are great ... I always love the view of comedians in dramatic roles ... as in Button's case, a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than " a more traditional actor.
