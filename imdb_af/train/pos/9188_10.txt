It's too bad, many people didn't understand it and the next episode. <br /> <br /> Don't worry! ill explain it to you :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> First part is Tony's "Dream" in his coma. Second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now that people don't understand, Tony's dream is more than just a dream. In this episode, it's about his preparation for his death. He loses his own identity and eventually forgets himself, so he breaks all his bonds with this world. You will see what I say at the doctor's scene, where Tony says he lost his briefcase containing his life. Their creators really did a wonderful job of interpreting, they have their own thoughts of what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will find this and the next episode a unique thing, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> Like every sopranos episode, the play and filming are excellent. <br /> <br /> Anything I didn't understand was the role of the monks. I'll see it again until I get it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode really touched me, and I don't think anyone else can give a better picture of what's happening in an almost death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 no doubt.
