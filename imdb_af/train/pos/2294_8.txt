... Hawk Heaven for French cinema enthusiasts and at French screen actors / actresses. At its worst, it is a leniency, actors dealing with other actors, the validity of acting as a profession, etc. While at best it is a wonderful celebration / reception of some of the best actors currently working. From a simple point of view - Jean-Pierre Marielle's request to ignore water in a restaurant - Turns Blier in all directions and lets the cream of the French cinema push their pieces before the camera even snaps to those who no longer around (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura), including the director's father, Bernard, one of the great stalwarts of the French cinema, of whom he ends up a heavenly call at the end of the film. Discursive and prolix, yes, guilty as charged but also something of a guilty pleasure.
