This is a wonderful classic monster movie from the 50's! I just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music. Anyway, I like the way the blob looks. I love when everyone in the late night is horrorflick at the theater and the blob comes in and the party crashes. Another thing I like about it is that it all happens in one night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane come out, they see a meteor falling out of space. Inside the meteorite is the blob. When the blob is consumed, it becomes larger and larger. They are trying to convince the people of the village about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. Can anything stop this blobby being? I recommend the BLOB!
