I see really really negative posts by people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the US at least until mid-September. Maybe it's unfortunate expats living in Korea. They saw it early. I'm in the US and have seen it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we're all accustomed to many other movies. It was not difficult to follow at all. The action by the lead was poor, but other people were pretty good. There was also humor throughout. I evaluated it at 8 because I had a good time watching it, what I worked for.
