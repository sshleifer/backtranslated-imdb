Two movies that have come back over Indian POWs; Feather Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story of a man who gives everything to someone, Deewaar focuses on the major himself. It is not hidden that many Indian POWs have been rotted in Pakistani prisons for many years - not even Indian Govt. have time or sympathy or the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani POWs are also in India, but let's focus on the movie. Full actors. Some were increased actors such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a major acting role. Akshaye Khanna did his part well. There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do as a few giggles and couples. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was the best, although it wasn't too long. He performed very well here and his dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, it was nothing more than a day-long movie with a story going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed movie that keeps a good fit and fair is for all actors. 7.5 / 10
