I was always a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch has shown critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the surrealistic aura that he has become known over the past decade. As much as the film G-rated, it is pure Lynch in style, pacing and tone. The film moves with a masterful hypnotic pass and is filled with scenes of real emotion and power. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is fantastic, as expected from a Lynch movie, and the transition mount rows are awesome. It is also very refreshing to see a movie where the characters are all friendly, friendly people and non-motivated characters that are clearly marked as 'good' or 'evil'. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns in a stunning performance like the rest of the movie, especially Sissy Spacek, in an engaging performance as his devil, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch proved critics that he could make a powerful moving movie just as he did in the '80s with' Blue Velvet 'and' The Elephant Man '. Critics have lost faith in the past decade if he produced such surrealist films like Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and Lost Highway, but with this film he showed that there was method for FWWM and LH, and critics seem to have finally caught up with his recent film Mulholland Drive, taking into account the high praise it received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> 'Straight Story' is one of the moving movies I 've ever seen. It is a loving story about family, friendship and the friendliness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.
