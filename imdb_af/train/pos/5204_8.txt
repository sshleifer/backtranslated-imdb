I don't watch much porn, but I love pornstars. And I love movies. When I heard about a porn star gore movie, I was very excited. Of course, it was years ago and when I heard of all the problems with making and finishing the movie, I never thought I'd actually get it. But I did and I am not ashamed to admit that I love it, even its mistakes. <br /> <br /> First, the bugs. The story is in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story it wants is about the Sawney Beane tribe from Scotland. So why not just sit there and skip the third-degree report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? Also, it breaks its own rules by stating that you are safe on the routes, but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere. It is never clear how many cannibals we are dealing with. There is a large stone castle that is of course old, but no one has seen it before. The self-conscious horror movie references are annoying and so are the characters. The heroine has a backstage montage of all her dead friends who include a character she never meets. The end doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> So what works? The gore! Certainly, I would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn't afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie. Two murders are over and Taylor Hayes has a disgusting scene. The two wild murders even get extensive shots on the DVD. I've always thought that Gore could overcome a stupid story and the evil race strengthened it.
