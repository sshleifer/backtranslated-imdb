Stargate SG-1 is a twist of all sorts of the 1994 movie "Stargate." I am so glad they decided to expand on the subject. The show gets it from the first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate again with his old companion, dr. Daniel Jackson, to meet. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent individual who allows no one to walk over her, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who covers his fake god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main bad guys are called the Gouald, they are parasites that can be brought into the brain, thus controlling and doing evil. Any Gouald that has a massive amount of power is often considered a "System Lord". The warriors behind the Gouald are known as Jaffa, which houses the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can be built into a human's brain. Through the episodes we see mostly SG-1, the exploratory team consisting of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, going through the wormhole that they transported immediately to other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they touch new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are on the world, which means that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather go on urgent issues on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years you begin to see a decrease in the SG -1 team so close to knit, and more character-building story lines. This in turn means even more global episodes that are perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, there are a few cases where story lines are not always wrapped and less of the emphasis on gateway over the past few years . But still, top science fiction!
