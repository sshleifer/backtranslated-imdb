I accidentally got this movie when I was recording all the movies I wanted my sister to record while on vacation and I'm so glad I included this one. It's about issues that most directors are ashamed of because my only problem with this movie is that it's made for TV so I couldn't buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's a touch of how people with eating disorders don't necessarily get rid of everyone and how much dieters actually have. It has made me aware that although bulimika can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences for their health that many people are ignorant.
