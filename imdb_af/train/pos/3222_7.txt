The first two rows of this movie set the two conflicts: the -ematic-conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity and the-physical conflict between Todd and his bio-engineer. Both sequences are gripping in different ways. <br /> <br /> The people's screenplay falls somewhat by solving the first of these bows on half of the movie. This means that the second half is no more than a straight action skirt. <br /> <br /> Yet, kudos to the creators of creating a genre action piece with heart and even a little soul and especially for Kurt Russell who share a lot with very little. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but worth seeing.
