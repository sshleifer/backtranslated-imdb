Like 'My Sassy Girl', this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet, but that's where the deal ends. The story is generally about this rebellious man, called Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who is still trying to complete high school, whose parents are a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman from A bad background comes, but happens the same age as he. Add to that a few obstacles, martial arts (shorter ones are always to Ji-Hoon for revenge), a weakened, dull love-sick girl who is after him, his proclivity to beat the lessons, and you can tell the whole story about the generally guess. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fighting scenes, good visual humor and a lot of fun, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of reason. And I have to say, I want a girl like Kim Ha Nuel like this girl of "My Sassy Girl" (personality-faithful, at least). She has a bit of spanking, but it's more in the cute, sweet, warm way. Characters are already mostly nice (one can say that it has less of a hill to climb than "My Sassy Girl" - a hurdle that worked for that movie to its credit) and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. The story kind of thing, but about 2/3 of the way (where it is at a well-known, standard price, where nothing really is interesting), but near the end, it gets a little up. Overall, a fun, cute movie. 8/10
