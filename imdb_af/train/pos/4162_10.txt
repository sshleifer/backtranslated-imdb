Yes it is. In fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 all-time favorite movies. Number 15, I think. Anyway, I'm usually not one for stands, but I think tombs work better in anime and RPG video games (for example Final Fantasy 7) and not movies. But this one has everything. Vibrant drawings of planets, stars, a highly written script. While it is not really for children, they can still see it, it contains no graphic blood, gut and silicone. But I don't think they'll understand it.
