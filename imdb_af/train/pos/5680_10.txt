Holy crap, it's so hysterical! Why not write American comedies like this? For anyone who thinks comedy should be stupid - there is more intelligence and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a rack of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. I couldn't believe it was the same man as Home! There are so many good lines and gags in this series, you can see a variety of ways every time and pick up new stuff every time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and sits on butler Edmund. This is my favorite of the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat blunt heart of the series, "the oppressed mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "As someone with a Wellington knife, he really puts his foot in it," and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder as the "top tipper salesman" and murderer of Scotland.
