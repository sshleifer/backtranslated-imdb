Among the standard one liner-type action films, where acting and logic are controlled at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person in charge had to put in good role-players in this movie, it would have been worse (except Richard Dawson who actually did well if you could "act yourself"). I love this movie! The Running Man is probably God's gift to man (okay maybe just men). Definitely the most quirky movie of our time, so I will share you with my favorite line: "It's all part of life's rich Brenda pattern, and you better get used to it." Ahh, more people are called "Brenda" for the sake of quoting this movie as I possibly can imagine.
