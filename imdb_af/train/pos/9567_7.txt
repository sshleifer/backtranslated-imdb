I watched the DVD of this movie, which also comes with an excellent commentary (in English). It looks like in Cambodia (English subtitles say the character speaks Thai but the movie says Cambodia). A very violent evil man makes boys use murderers who use famine and train them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the murder a police spouse is killed. The cop Wai is a loose cannon worried about his father, who is also a policeman shot in a coma. Wai's head is his father's friend and is worried about Wai's erratic behavior. He didn't know Wai was the one who caught his father in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him in the coma. Pang escapes and stumbles into a dirty landfill where he meets a woman who has come here to find her mother and reiterates that her father is not leaving her. (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand it, but saves her from her father who apparently has sex with her, maybe that's the reason for Cat III). Wai is getting more and more obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant. Wai follows and joins the evil man (whose sons practice) to make a deal to fight and learn so he can get Pang. There is a big appearance between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman, the main victim, and Wai is dead and Pang cuts his child out of the dead mother to just die and leave him as the possible next boy as a murderer be. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. The woman with a long nail pulled out of her foot. Knives on the neck and torso. Guns shot directly to the head. And many very intense beats. It may be intense and indifferent, but it's definitely worth seeing.
