The autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heartbreaking books I've ever read. It tells the incredible stories of two sisters, who both deserve devotion and respect to work well in their 70s as teacher and dentist. Then they lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious "black" Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses her anger, fear and wisdom; She lets you know exactly where they came from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll's perfect sense of the older sister, the teacher, but I'm afraid she never believes she's more than 100. No matter - the stories are worth telling. Amy Madigan is overwhelmed and overwhelmed in the acting and uncertain in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times reporter. It's also just a slight distraction. All the stories are the attraction and although two or three are slightly damaged in the translation, most of them do well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as essential reading to all the people I recommend to any book. I can't just watch this TV movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly suffices from the scent to be highly worth it in its own right.
