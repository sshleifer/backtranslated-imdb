This is a very unusual movie, as the star with the top bill does not literally appear halfway. Yet I was engaged by the Phantom Lady hook. Curtis, though capable of falsely accusing Scott Henderson, seems a little difficult to sympathize with (perhaps he should have shaved his mustache) and his behavior at home should at least have some convinced innocence. . While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I found his character of the character to be impressively complex. He's no stock villain. Excellent character actor Elisha Cook Jr is again in the best shape as the "little man with great ambitions." His drums in musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. However, this film is worn by the very capable and cute Ella Raines, as the devotee would be Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her work I've seen and I'm definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the supporting role is also more than capable. All in all, a very satisfying film noir secret, which today is seen today, is aimed at the dark and complex urban world. Recommended, 8/10.
