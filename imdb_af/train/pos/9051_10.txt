I watched it when my wife called to ask the other room for my choice of price. My comments? "I look at my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only 5 years or older than the "Rocket Boys", I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our education administrators and how the whole Science show was gaining momentum and me and others taken in the competitive storm. My own tornado landed me in my own state's Science Scholarship, in Physics by '62, although our group was less successful in getting support from, for example, firefighters who approached us for guidance and advice after a tragic event, city ​​so far enough to allow us to tour the Nike mission area on Chicago's beach. <br /> <br /> This movie has kept it all for me, and I'll bet it's all for a bunch of our "50s" and "60s" UberNerds. <br /> <br /> We are currently in a similar scientific brain drainage and need this movie as a country. See it!
