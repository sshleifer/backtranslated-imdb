John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his series in the role of a crunchy old curmudgeon who reluctantly agreed to take an evacuation in the streets of London (World War II). <br /> <br /> It is said, the movie is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying end. Some characters are a little underdeveloped (especially the school teacher), but none of them are essential to the plot. Actually, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie doesn't need much.
