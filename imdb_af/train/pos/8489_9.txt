I teach Japanese for an online high school and I include cultural activities so that students can learn about the country as well as the language. And looking at "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. The students can buy or rent the movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students to see other people see the world and their lives differently from what we do. Many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much, they were going to get a copy themselves. It is very interesting to see what we appreciate in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I could get a cleaned TV version. I'm not really in the rough language used by car workers all the time.
