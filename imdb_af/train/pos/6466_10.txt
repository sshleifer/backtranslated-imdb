I really loved this movie and so did the audience I saw in Los Angeles. After the movie, many people were crying and saying how much the movie had touched them. I can see why it was such a big hit in his homeland, Sweden. The film is masterfully directed and every character is brilliantly drawn so you really know these people and care for them. The music is very natural and the main song in the film is quite heartbreaking but inspiring. Will definitely recommend this movie for everyone to watch - even people who don't normally go to caption movies. Definitely deserving of the Oscar Nomination because of the in-depth themes of the film that are reflected without pretense in a small town with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. A MUST SEE!
