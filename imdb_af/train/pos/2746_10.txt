Imagine sticking out the lights in a remote place on a cold evening and then going to sleep. There is no need to close the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometimes after midnight there is a car with lights off, up to the driveway. Moments later, an intruder radiates a flashlight into your darkened lounge. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so terrible is the setting: a remote farm ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, In Cold Blood offers a terrifying story, especially in the first law, as the plot is mainly at night and on rain. Drenched land takes place on roads. It's the things of nightmares. But it's not a dream. The events really happened, in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two girls full of delusions kill a whole Kansas family, looking for a lot of cash that doesn't exist. Director Richard Brooks uses the real places where the real events took place, even the farmhouse ... and its inside! It makes a memorable, ghostly movie. <br /> <br /> Both main players look very much like the two life-long killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing like Perry Smith, short and sturdy with a topping, dreaming to find Cortez's buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the fluently-speaking artist with an American-American smile. <br /> <br /> After killing, the duo went to Mexico. Things go wrong there so they come back to the US, steal cars, hitchhiking, and generally miserable as they walk from place to place. But it's a fool's life, and the two unbelievers soon regret their actions. The film's last twenty minutes are captivating, as the rain falls, the rope stiff and everything we hear is a beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with its somewhat mundane law, "In Cold Blood" stages in rude detail, a real story still hypnotized, almost half a century later. It's the institution that does it. Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still have their doors unlocked ... at night?
