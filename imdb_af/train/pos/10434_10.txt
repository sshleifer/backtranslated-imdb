the most wonderful combination of love and psyche of two young people. Presented in the most sublime way and certainly touching your heart. A rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions. The film rule confirms your belief in love and pain of separation. The joy of seeing your loved one is unmatched and anything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie set up eternal characters with such simplicity that give the film a joy and love to watch. A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic (at least one of them) movies of all time.
