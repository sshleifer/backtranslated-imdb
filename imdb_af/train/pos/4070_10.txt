I know Anime. I worked long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just so, you know I'm not screaming about me, let me say it: From all the animations I've seen, Castle in Heaven is by far one of the best. Clearly, people say Spirited Away is the best, but I disagree completely. Most people just know that movie because it is an Acedmy award; This is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in Heaven to people who have ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the last two are the superiors of the three. Personally, I never thought anything could compare to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think the foregoing is the better of the two, but Castle in Heaven is easy to look at. Castle has in many respects great elements that Mononoke lacks. Anyway, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think it's Miyazaki's best movie, be prepared to shake your earth.
