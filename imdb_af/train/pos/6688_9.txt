In the history of movies based on cartoons, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated children. It's not an ordinary comic superhero movie! This follows the exploitation of a moderate crew of benevolent wannabes, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spleen (paul reubens) "Mystery Men" spoof various aspects of superhero movies like " Superman "or" Batman ", like the spicy words, and questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes are not billionaires such as Bruce Wayne, but blueberries with many jobs and neurotic home life. It looks like director Kinka Usher is making the heroes in something the average viewer relates to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it's not a franchise, it's still a pleasure to watch!
