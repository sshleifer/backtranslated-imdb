A young cat tries to steal his brother's soul from the dead, but only gets half of it and then needs adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm not sure what is happening in this movie, it's full of very strange, surrealistic images that some parents might be disturbing (that is, cats cut off a pig that travel with them and fry it like bacon that eats all three.) <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie that some have compared to Hello Kitty. I think it's more like Hello Kitty as Dali did. . (Certainly, it's more lively than Destino, who was directly based on his work.) <br /> <br /> If you're a very fast movie that will challenge your perceptions of things, watch this movie. Just get ready for some very strange images that will be burned forever in your memory. <br /> <br />
