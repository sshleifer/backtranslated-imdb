I noticed that this movie was scrapped well before it hit the theaters and I didn't have much hope for it either. I thought it was a different kind of "You've Served" type with some nice dance moves and horror work. I was at the theater and decided between this and met the Spartans and chose it. To my surprise, the play was not bad at all and the movie was pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than you have served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage being placed here, I recommend seeing a matinee show of this movie so you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how wrong everyone was about it. When it comes to dance movies, it's definitely one of the better ones with much better acting than many of the others. Check out the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully, the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people look at the movie instead of judging by comment before the movie is released. <br /> <br /> Editing the movie now moves closer to its correct rating. More than 1,000 people gave it a score of 9, a bit too high, but at least it helps offset the ridiculous vote of 1.
