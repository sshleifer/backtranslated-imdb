What a great movie! Eventually, a picture revealing an unknown side of the rock is the illusion of fame. Famous Rockers become old and forgotten, not the music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's rock around the clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap for example. Why? Because in still crazy people are mature. They have a different view on rock, about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth who miss them so much. Besides the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Spend a good time looking at it (listen to the incredible soundtrack!) and finally think of your own future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
