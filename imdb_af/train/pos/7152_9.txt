'Holes' was a BIG movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talked about said they loved it. All thrown was suitable for the part they had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was exactly how I imagined her. Everyone who hasn't seen it recommends it and I guarantee you will dig it.
