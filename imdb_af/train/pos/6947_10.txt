24 is the best television show !!!!! It's an amazing TV series with incredible thrills, excellent venues and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best evidence. Because it's just the first episode, just the introduction, and you're addicted to the plot and the continuous twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Jack Bauer is a federal agent who has assigned Senator David Palmer's protection. . He can't trust anyone because CTU people can be involved. And when these events happened to his daughter, Kimberly escaped from home to party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want more, and more, and more. <br /> <br /> It's just the first of fate, and it's excellent.
