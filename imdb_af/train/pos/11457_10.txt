As the jacket proclaims, this movie is "suddenly shot and masterfully edited", and yes, it's amazingly beautiful. The timelessness we see in stoic rocks and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water sets the ephemeral works of Goldsworthy's hands, so that in their eternal eternity they refer to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his compositions haunts us with just a touch of melancholy - or in the words of Matthew Arnold of Dover Beach: <br /> <br /> Listen! You hear the rock cloud of the pebbles that pull back the waves and flake. Come back to them, the high beach, start and stop and start again. With a slow cadence slow and bring in the eternal note of sadness. br /> <br /> At one point near the end of the film, Goldsworthy says, "Words do their job, but what I do here says a lot more." As a wordsmith myself, I take no offense and I do not think for a moment, because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that carefully and intuitively create Goldsworthy is something more than mere words can say . <br /> <br /> At another point, he says, "What's here to stay ... and what's not." This is his theme. <br /> <br /> I think artists in the twentieth century have become aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this concept by compiling works that were deliberately ephemeral. The idea was that by emphasizing how short a lifetime is even the most powerful works of man, a sense of timelessness is expressed. Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this kind of expression. He carefully composes a form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it, or places it in the river where it will be taken away; and in this process both the composition and its ephemeral are fused. <br /> <br /> Both the transition and the timeless are needed for us to understand our world and our place within it. And it is important that these works be done in the context of nature so that what is composed is within the natural environment. So, the stone walls and the stones of stone that are golden and worthy of constructions, but we know that they are not eternal, but instead remain for some indefinite time and then disappear and return to a state so much existed before we came together. <br /> <br /> It's art like art must be related to the spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Goldsworthy's work is an unpleasant concept. It is an experience of time and form. In his sense, Shelley's famous poem responds "Ozymandias" by saying, just as the tide blows away the work, and even if the river disappears, art continues to live because of our experience. Likewise, one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings that are so carefully compiled and measured, and then, just as they are so beautiful and precious, they are given the wind, so we can know that everything is flowing. <br /> <br /> But in the modern world, these artwork endures in photos and videos. Goldsworthy is a perfect photographer (of necessity I would say) and all his works, even the unsuccessful, tells us, is photographed so he can look at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has achieved and what he has done did not have. <br /> <br /> This movie production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriate ghostly music of Fred Frith should not be missed. This is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
