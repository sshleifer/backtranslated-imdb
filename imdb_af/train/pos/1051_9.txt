This is a powerful documentary document on domestic abuse in the Cameroon. The "sisters" in the law are female lawyers and judges who successfully prosecuted men in 2004 for the abuse of their wives and won one wife, a divorce she desperately wanted by a Muslim council. It is quite long - about two hours - but fascinating in terms of both the individual claimants and the defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court facilities by female judges. It will leave you, as it has left me, with many questions about exactly how this change took place. How and when did women come to hold positions of authority in Cameroon? Did the various cases in this film have a significant impact on the treatment of women in general by their spouses? Was granting a divorce by a Muslim court, against the express wishes of the man, a one-off event? I do not suggest that the filmmakers could have answered these questions. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.
