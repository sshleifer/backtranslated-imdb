The unfortunate men-magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally kills his models. When the beautiful ladies start killing for the real, Adrien worries that he can be the killer. Author / Director William Byron Hillman tells the striking story at a steady pace, builds a fair amount of tension, delivers some horrendously effective moments of cruel misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it Placed over her headline rates as the definite everlasting insightful highlight) puts a refreshing emphasis on the beautifully drawn and engaging, true-to-life characters. Furthermore, everything is grounded in a probable everyday world and tackled with a nice female nudity. The fine that plays an excellent role helps many: Joanna Pettet as sunny, lovely love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's macho double-amputee brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as Adrien's worried psychiatrist Dr Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as gutsy murder detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a stubborn police chief, and Misty Rowe as sweet, bubbly model Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive use of breathtaking panoramic aerial photographs. Jack Goga's ominous rattling count also does the trick. In the bits, Robert Tessier is an abominable bartender, Sally Kirkland as an angry hooker, Kathy Shower as a fiery female wrestler B.J. joking in the ring and Francesbaai in one of her standard old women's roles. A solid and fun picture.
