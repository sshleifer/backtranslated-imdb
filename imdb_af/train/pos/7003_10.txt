The emotional impact of this movie makes words wrong. It's elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic. For two hours it has rolled. It is Will Smith as he matures in his acting ability, the full extent of it. What did you know? I saw and thought The Pursuit of Happiness, it should be a feast for the stupid, best actor, Smith. His performances in both movies show a very different dimension to Smith, a talent paint, the selectivity of the scripts, I don't know, but I see him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that you must fully enjoy, should you suspend your faith. Don't look at the plot, look at the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, reconciliation, love and sacrifice.
