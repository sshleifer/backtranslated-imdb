It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely due to Aids. The projected toll is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths can be expected. Apart from the horror statistics, personal stories are seldom heard about. Christophe Honore describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo, a film produced for French television as part of a series of issues for young people. Although it is fictitious, it is about a situation that is unfortunately too common - the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving, closed family. <br /> <br /> When one-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has Aids, the family is ruined. Out of concern for his youth, they decided to withhold the information of his youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he heard the conversation and began to deceive and act. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel along, but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick and Marcel is sad but accepted. When he brings Marcel to meet some former gay friends, the tension between them boils on the surface and sets the stage for a decisive conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in the bed that had physical contact between the brothers, I feel the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances by Lespert and Mignard more than the scales in his favor tip. Seeing events deployed from the young boy's perspective gives the film a authenticity that reminds me of the Quebecois movie Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Contrary to some American films dancing around AIDS, Close to Leo tells a hard truth, but it does so in a way that is soft and wonderful.
