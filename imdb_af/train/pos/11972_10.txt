I grew up watching Full House as a child. I've been watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started looking again. Now my kids are watching the show and they like to see it too. My kids can't believe DJ, on show, and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love the show because it's a show you can see with your family. It has good teachings with which to teach children. There is also no drug and violence on it. Even if the children on the show have a problem, they can always open their family for help. It's the message that children from a few days come off the TV, turn to your family for help, not drugs. Kids now have to watch more performances like Full House instead of half the mess on TV. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it's on earth. It is about real life problems and family issues. There is always a lesson that you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote the show a 10.
