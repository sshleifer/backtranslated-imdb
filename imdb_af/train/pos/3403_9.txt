Beautiful Techicolor production tells the unusual story of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who left his monastery, breaking his vows. The film opens at a monastery in Europe, where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in the black name of Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is advised by the Mother Superior to go to the desert and free herself and lose her sadness about her father who recently died. In the train car on the way to the Sahara, she sits opposite a very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. She will soon be at a hotel near a palm-tree oasis where she again sees our mysterious upset man as he bumps into what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl. Domini becomes friends with him but knows nothing of his past - romance will soon follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a little champion) - I find it very enjoyable and entertaining. The photography in this is very interesting - it is full of extreme facials and beautiful shades of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouetted figures at a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a nice, overall, handicapped performance here and looks great. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - is actually pretty good at this, I think the part fits him and he also looks very young and beautiful. Basil Rathbone is good here, except very little to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps make the drama roll. All in all, a very enjoyable movie.
