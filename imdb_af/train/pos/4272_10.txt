this is what I call a good movie. it lives by the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story. There are real characters that can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, as life is. The bus driver and his son gather people across the country (Yugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrade. The funny and cruel situations that happen on the road connect the people and the pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> watch it and you'll remember it for life ... it's filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> And another reason for his magic: it's hard to get !!
