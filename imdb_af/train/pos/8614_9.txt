The film has taken my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts because the plot was not over. I had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much egg night the previous night). The movie was very sad and touched too. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a good new talent (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott also does an excellent job with his part. The relationship of the mother and daughter might have been unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. It definitely hit the other programs on the TV New Year's Eve
