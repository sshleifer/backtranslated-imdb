Parker and Stone relocate their spicy, explicit-disturbed humor from their animated masterpiece to a live-feature-featured movie, with generous good results. Much of the movie is Trey and Matt runs amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys find out a new sport, a mix of ramp basketball with baseball scoring that becomes a national craze. Along the way they meet numerous sports movies and send them along, along with any other popular culture that comes into their attractions. It runs like an expansive South Park episode, with the usual machine gun dialogue, toilet humor and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this movie is poor, it is the association with the team we gave "Airplane" and the "Naked Gun" series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame siggats and the presence of a shiny and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a bit better to play the corporate game that has been overworking since its "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine, just as he can, but one has to admit that he is perfect for the role of the crazy team owner. /> <br /> For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone look more comfortable than rock star boobs as comics. It manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they offer a good choice here, including the mandatory cut of their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA. <br /> <br /> A special mention should be made to Dian Bachar, who deserves a award for the difficult task of playing Stan to Parker and Stone's premier Cartmans. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is an entertaining comedy that is held back to its full potential by too much confidence in the "Naked Gun / Airplane" formula. Parker and Stone can do something really brilliant (or absolutely horrible) if they get full control of a future movie. America, join these guys or put them in control.
