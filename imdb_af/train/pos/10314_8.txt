This one and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, something in this new series is missing. Perhaps they emphasize too much the lesson to be learned. It's a little more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can also be considered sentimental. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite. I remember not being surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later in "The Lake House. I think this is because I first saw this episode, so it destroyed the impact of the later movie.
