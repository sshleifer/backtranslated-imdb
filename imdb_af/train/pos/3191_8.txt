Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand in visual comedy, successfully leads this Hal Roach road show, which offers a fast and pleasant scenario and excellent casting, with a large number of Roach's reputable artists. Although the movie was originally portrayed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, sunny Jack Haley stars like Joe Jenkins, a young Chancellor who sells his car repair business and trips to Hollywood, where he tries to play a screen role for the girl he loves , to strangle Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as his set, does so here if Cecilia, always ready for audition, is being treated by an acting paramour, filmmaker Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), behind the screen action of of course a musical comedy, with Broadway leader Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer a variety of pleasurable interludes, including their well-known skit that includes a small harmony, and we look closely at Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. In balance, one has to hand over the bays to Mischa Auer, stealing the picture as an emotional movie star, a role he creates largely, and the director for his clever closing of Busby Berkeley's cinematic glasses.
