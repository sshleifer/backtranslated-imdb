As a collector of film memorabilia, I had to buy the movie poster for this movie, which is now the best, since I finally saw it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. However, there is nothing more terrible about inserting your video recorder than a half-hour image of the smoker. Initially I thought this movie was pure garbage, but then I realized that it had features that made me laugh. The character of dr. Ted Nelson must be the most beautiful person ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so thin, it's incredible! ("It's incredible! He looks stronger as he melts!) <br /> <br /> Please tell me how completely they know exactly how much time Steve has before he completely melts and exactly what they plan to do to him. If this film was meant to scare his audience, I think it missed his calling.
