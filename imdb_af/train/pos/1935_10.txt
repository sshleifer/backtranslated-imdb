Writing something truth and truth is challenging. Knowing how to shoot and merge it without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's movie is one where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by "The Great Bad Swim" and from now on I will promote it as far as possible. It's just a shame that I can't show my friends (you know, like a DVD ???) because talking is good ... but seeing something is better. Everyone can't go to festivals to discover pearls so this movie is really worth it to be! Thank you to the staff of this masterpiece, and I wait for it to be distributed.
