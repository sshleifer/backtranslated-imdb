Also like this movie. Seen this when it was first shown in Germany in a small independent theater in Frankfurt. It was very busy and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner was the producer and director. In his genre it was a very ambitious movie, especially if you think it was an independent movie. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of the movie, Mortitz Boerner came out of the theater and two or three short movies also worked more for television before becoming a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For those who want to see that movie again, you can find it on their homepage that is not so easy to find but it is possible.
