I didn't expect very high expectations for this movie, which pleasantly surprised me. The story is a bit odd sometimes, but overall I think it's an acceptable credibility. The action scenes are pretty nice and the accompanying music is used to cause a bit of patriotic feelings commonly found in American movies. This may not be the best movie ever, but it is unusual for Sweden and I hope to see more similar in the future.
