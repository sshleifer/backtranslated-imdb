This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and some funny pieces. I laugh at Millie, the little girl, who pretends to be a debutant, keep her happy while chatting and unnecessarily polishing her furniture while chatting. I just can't get past her French accent, because it's never a problem, because she's trying to surrender her as the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> See a teen Mel Torme and the very young Frank Sinatra song is such a treat. My mom saw Frank Sinatra at a theater, and the same movie came out. She said they couldn't clear the "bobby-soxers" between movies (in those days you didn't have to leave between shows). This movie shows you how attractive and attractive the young Frank was and also appreciates his early talent. And Victor Borge gets a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie with a sweet, simple story. Very pleasant.
