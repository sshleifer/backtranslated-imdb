I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say it was the best slasher movie I've seen for years. Unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being honest than being suicide. For those out there who have hated "Scream", there is no reference to the "horror rules" in this movie (although the old shooter rules apply here). <br /> <br /> It's the perfect mix of the horror of the 80's and 90's. You get the style, cinematography, and good 90's acting and the stalking slasher madness of an 80's movie. I think the year 2001 will finally give horror supporters the kind of movies they want. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards is here as a fun character. You can say she's holding her role, and it makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
