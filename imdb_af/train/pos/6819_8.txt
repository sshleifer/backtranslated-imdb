I found 'Time At the Top' which was an entertaining and stimulating experience. The acting, though not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a movie, obviously aimed at the younger demographic, it's definitely one of the better works in the genre (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children, and 'Time At The Top' makes no difference to this theory! I don't think that continuity and great acting for younger people is important. A good plot and an imaginative script are much more important to them. Both are abundant in this movie. The special effects are good, without detracting from the story, or ending the viewers' own imagination. It would have been very easy to spray an overload of SFX into this movie, but it would have completely destroyed its entire 'Raison D'etre'. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie, complementing the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. Overall, this movie is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes, or those who try like me! Now I have to read the original book as soon as possible.
