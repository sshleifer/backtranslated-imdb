"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humanity, which before the beginning of World War II appears from the eyes of seemingly ordinary and ordinary people from a God-leaving Serb province. I saw it in a small kiosk in Russia where the film had a very limited distribution and I never had it. It is a pity that this excellent movie is almost forgotten. I often searched for a VHS or DVD copy, and unfortunately - nobody could find it. I would be most grateful to most fans of this movie recording for suggesting ways to buy a copy.
