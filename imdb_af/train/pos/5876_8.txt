Now I liked a lot of this movie, it was so funny. But Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors. I think after the movie they have to do a lot more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by sharing three women at once, but the way he handles as one comes out of the door and the other one is just as funny to look at he was really good at his role and I hope he will make more comedy in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, plays his part very well and he is so underrated. I'm glad some of his wonderful work has been noticed, but he's a very good actor. . I just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. <br /> <br /> The museum is really good, I recommend this movie to everyone.
