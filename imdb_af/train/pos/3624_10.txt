The Rookie made me smile from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection. The boy playing his son was fantastic. He made it a father-boy movie to remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failure to chase is as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I believe this movie will be a classic.
