Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a bit generous, but for this movie, I think the directors did a good job that made them available. It's also a movie that is a filmed taste! <br /> <br /> My immediate thought was directly related to the classic cult film 'The Thing', that is, the parasitic strangers from outside space, polluting human hosts and then destroying where possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror / gore genre, but cleverly maintains its own originality. These things fight one another and then continue to eat than the rival! Just kill and pick one when it needs a new host! Then choose another battle with another infected host! And this movie even throws in a love story, but I won't say it anymore, it gives away too much. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But as I said about an acquired taste, don't be surprised if you didn't like the movie. It is a low budget and yes, it is bloodthirsty, with the creatures / strangers / things hitting their limbs in rough weapons, that is, sawing, drilling, blades and even the alien rifle for everyone, but exposing opponent. I curled myself over what I was shown, but at the same time glued to the screen and wondered what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like Gore, you love strangers, you love fighting and even maybe some love thrown somewhere, then I should recommend this movie as a must see. I just wish I had it earlier when I did it!
