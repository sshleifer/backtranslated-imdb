Bugs life is a good movie. But it doesn't really compare me to movies like Toy story and things. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but it wasn't as good as Toy story. The film has the visual, laughter and others that Toy story had. But the movie didn't really feel ... I don't know, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> Bugs live ... I don't want to say that is a movie I don't remember. I saw it years ago. Of course I haven't seen Toy story for years, but I still remember it. I didn't have to review this movie, but I am. I give it a thumb, but it's not exactly the best work Pixar did. <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life: *** / ****
