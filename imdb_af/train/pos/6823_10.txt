Last week I searched for movies by John Cassavetes - starting with a woman under the influence 'and ending with' opening night '. I was completely and completely blown away, especially by these two films. From the first minute to the last in 'opening night' I was completely and completely absorbed. I've experienced it a few times, but the feeling that this movie was perfect resulted in about two-thirds, up to the credits. All about this movie, the way it was shot, is the incredible performance of Gena Rowlands, the credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the depth of the pace, the softness, the originality, the characters, the deft. little moments .... for me, is really sublime. I couldn't agree with the previous comment on taking it to a desert island, because the sheer depth of this movie is something to see. If you unfortunately have enough home fire, I guarantee that instead of trying a last ditch to save that money under your bed, you will save your copy of this movie.
