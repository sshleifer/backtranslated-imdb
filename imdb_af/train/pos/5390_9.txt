Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie with some of the best of the era. It is in the maternity ward of a hospital, especially in the room where the women expected to have problems. There is an elderly woman, a tough, unwanted mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young) who used murder for 20 years. Her husband (Eric Linden) is at the hospital every second and hurts to know that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is excellent in her work. <br /> <br /> This film is very interesting and entertaining. It's not terribly shocking, but it's interesting to see such a neglected box on the silver screen. The acting is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is beautiful in her front. Eric Linden comes from nowhere and is sincere as it can be. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is big as always, a staple of front codes and for good reason.
