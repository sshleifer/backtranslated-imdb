A realistic depiction of young love for the college, but also appealing to an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and turns and turns and dropped me a tear or two. We rarely see black urban characters movies that can appeal to older, non-black audiences and show a more real-life portrayal of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are several friends acquaintances and situations that get them better or worse. Typical plot some may say, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself surviving the couple's relationship as I saw my own past in their story. Moments of deep thinking and revelation poured out of the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It's a bright movie that will support or ever fall in love with the youth of love and love. Great movie. I'm looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
