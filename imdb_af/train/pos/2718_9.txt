Last year we were treated to two films about Truman Capote, in which the book was made from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine a movie like this being made in 1967. A powerful, powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a movie classic by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Kat on a Hot Tin Roof, the professional Blackboard Jungle). Interestingly, Robert Blake, who had a star in this film, had so many late-night problems related to his portrayal of a killer in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching.
