I only rented this movie years ago and was completely surprised. Just recently I had a strange need to see some of the too few movies I enjoyed in my lifetime. I decided to give Erendira a different look. And I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that at least the glare of this movie at least didn't fade. <br /> <br /> The story of a teenage girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some ways she looks like Winona Ryder!) accidentally burns her grandmother's house, after which the grandmother , hipster, played by Irene Papas, forcing the girl into a prostitution life to pay the damage. <br /> <br /> The show is engaging and compelling at once. Although, despite the basic principle of prostitution, it is tastefully invalid for the satisfying, steaming sexual content. The story revolves around the interaction between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters they come into contact with their stay - which is incidentally in the rough and arid part of rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The movie is very atmospheric, constantly enigmatic with a definite dream quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not on the point of a David Lynch movie. It is also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical, read the comments of previous viewers below. <br /> <br /> Often in the background, you hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, and just add the right musical accent to highlight the Mexican environment. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is moving at a good pace, not too fast or too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it again just because it was you let's do it. For me, it's really that compelling. <br /> <br /> Hopefully you'll see the movie in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was fortunate enough to understand much of the dialogue. To the parents, "I didn't know how big it was." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - it's a small world.) <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the stumbling block on a dusty old bottle of vintage wine drinking very satisfying, but you have some grief with the realization that there are no more bottles like this one.
