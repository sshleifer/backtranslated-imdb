Another reason to watch this beautiful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon realized who Florence Rice was, a real beauty that has a wonderful performance. As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. From 1939 it was another time, but in it lay the charm. It transports you to another world. It starts out as a light comedy, but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice runs the spectrum from comedy to heroine. She is absolutely beautiful, at the same time strong, vulnerable, developing from a girl to a woman. Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made forty movies, and I'm going to pick the other nine and nine. Alan Marshal is from the Flynn / Gable and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer some excellent comic moments, but the right star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's / 40's movies, don't miss this one!
