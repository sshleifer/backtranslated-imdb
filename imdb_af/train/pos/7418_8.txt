"Shower" is a story of loyalty, about the unstoppable progress of the modern world, at the expense of rather traditional and more human ways of life. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his big city life, his wife and his delayed young brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we need to do. The modern China versus the ancient one. The public baths with its gatherings, its cricket battles against the malls and the skyscraper. Many old men and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills the others. <br /> <br /> Tender, moving, full of funny moments, and of bitter-sweet children. The sensitive one will cry and laugh one day. The actors are huge, especially the one who performs the role of the delayed boy; and Yang Zhang makes a good job, easy, simple, so that the story just flows by itself. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
