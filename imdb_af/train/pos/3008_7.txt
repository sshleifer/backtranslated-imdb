The inflammable William Powell. He is delighted to look at the screen because he is making his way through situations without caring in the world. He always looks on top of his game and shows little concern for anyone who doubts him. The murders are projects, scarce people. I noticed it's a staple of the whodunnit. Except as a deviant widow, the victims fulfill the function of why the film exists. Nothing more. There are plenty of turns and turns to keep things going, and Powell is a master here. There is a lot of political inaccuracy, especially if it relates to Asian artists. It's a little difficult to take. The role play is wonderful, and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
