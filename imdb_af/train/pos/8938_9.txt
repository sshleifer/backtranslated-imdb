A wonderful movie version of the best-selling book and breaking Broadway's play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African American sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of a century-old American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give good performances like Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Harth, the white New York Times reporter whose article on the sisters launched the book. Many of the flashback screens and even many of today's people are very powerful, if not totally inspiring. as in the book. This is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly portrayed, such as the inter-racial background of the sister's mother and why their father was so strict. But other than that, a very well done, excellent, powerful movie.
