After 'Beau travail' everyone is waiting for Claire Denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never arrived. Now it has. Denis makes a quantum leap in this film, an orgy of beautiful cinematography, elliptical editing and deliberately clear narrative events that feel weird and even stranger. There is a nominal plot (derived in part from the Jean-Luc Nancy book of the same name) about an adult man who needs a heart transplant and who is looking for a Tahitian boy he has left long ago; but mostly it is an exploration of the notion of intrusions, personal and cultural. It requires some views to fully understand, and has pacing problems close to the end, but it's even more advanced and gripping than anything else I've seen this year. Miss it at your danger.
