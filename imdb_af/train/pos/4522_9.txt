This one surprised me because in the past I was disappointed by Adrian Pasdar, but he caught the perfect balance in this show. It avoided both farce and pathos while delivering humor and true emotions. The always wonderful Julie Waters is great here, and anyone who has never performed her in 1983's educational Rita must rent it immediately (wonderful movie). The rest of the supporting characters are also well played, very extraordinarily eccentric without going over. This one is fun.
