If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I advise you to go out. It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, who apparently had a nice time shooting some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but fun to watch so you can learn it know as only people, and when the concert is shown to a talented musician, both playful and professional rock and look the screaming girls impress. If you watch him in concert, you'll never know it's a rock star, but a good time to play good songs with good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr that appear in some live performances. True, there are a few songs I liked, but there is nothing like an album. I just bought it in 2006, but if I knew it came out in 1972, I would definitely have bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars will never learn and die in a car accident!
