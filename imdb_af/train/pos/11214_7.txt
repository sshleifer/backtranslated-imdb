It was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think in a $ 2 kiosk next to Hollywood Blvd. So I didn't refer to the first installment made by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by the damaged system of McNairy County and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he was not going to let go and went out to do something about it. Encourage? I thought so - to the point where it made my spine rise. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a good story about American courage to stand up and do something about a system that only serves its own interest. I was nicely blown away and think it is still one of the best movies of the hero / anti-hero genre that one can laugh at, but also recent movies like "The Punisher" but even more because it " a true story. The recent remake that makes up the "Rock" just doesn't do the right fire in the story of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> A "classic" I'm sure will come up again in the future.
