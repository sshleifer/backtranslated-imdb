Skippy from Family Ties goes from shabby to metal kid in this pretty cute movie. The film seems to have been made in response to all the troubled parents who claim that metallic music is making their children angry or killing themselves - except in this one, a deadly satanic metal star tries to return from the grave (with Skippy helping). And while the plot is corn and cliche, the wheat (for example, an evil green manure that takes out a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack is what makes the film so hilarious (and great). And of course, there is nothing like Ozzy Osbourne who plays a preacher asking what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to have some friends over for a good laugh. And while you're on it, it makes a dual feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's a "black rocker" (as shown on the video box) drill murderer in black leather w / fringe. A must see for cute movie lovers.
