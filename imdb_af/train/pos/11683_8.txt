I really enjoyed this episode, which has given a big surprise because of the bad reputation it looks like. From a pure writing perspective, The 16mm Shrine, is an absolute surprise, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical of Sterling. I especially enjoyed the philosophical reception of the episode and tackling the themes of existence and reality while balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride and desire. "The sixteen millimeter sanctuary" is an episode on how these ideas are based on a reluctance to accept change, a person who may seem alienated from the rest of the ever-changing world. It is also a fantastic example of cerebral Twilight Zone; one who explores the mind rather than the world beyond. These elements all come together very well to create a thoughtful and incredibly interesting 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, the episode is not without its flaws, but lies mainly in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout, with just a few scenes that could count as memorable. This is, of course, an absolute disgrace, considering how well Sterling wrote her character. Furthermore, Leisen does not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, and sometimes they stand to do nothing - which probably explains why the poor performances of Lupino were accepted half the time. Luckily, Balm does a good job of covering at least some weak spots, at least delivering the view from an acting perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said before, if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, it shouldn't be as bad as it sometimes is. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the episode also contains fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the show looks good, almost fifty years later!) And decent enough set design. Overall "The sixteen millimeter sanctuary" is a major episode and most importantly, one that reminds you.
