This is a fan-made short film pretending to be a preview for a new movie that pairs Batman and Superman! This is the kind of movie that fans adore and watch in places like ComicCon and are made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As far as it goes, I can easily pick it apart. Certainly the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, it's made on a shocking budget and for a fan movie it's incredible. I was especially impressed by the very struggling Superman - he was not a wimpy little man! If it was just a preview for a real movie, their fans here have been to Omaha to see it. Good work.
