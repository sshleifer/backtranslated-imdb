Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad, Knightly, doesn't look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fantastic job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emma's father. I love the end scene (which is an addition to the novel - but well written) when the crop arrives and Knightly dines with its workers and friends of the high society. Emma must show that she accepts it now. She is a changed woman. It's too much too fast, but OK. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's ex-governess and confidant. She is wonderful. just as I had suggested her. I believe that when the UK does a Jane Austen, it's best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this one!
