Some people have stated that South Park started a tendency to leave their politically biting satire behind shallow spoofs from the 11th season. but it cannot be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode spoofs the Living Dead series, there's more. It is a satire of how people treat the homeless. Characters say things like, "They pretend to be just like us" or "They want to be human." This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who often just fall on their happiness. <br /> <br /> So yes, it's still a satire, and also a wonderful spoof. What else can you have?
