I really can't remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It's definitely a strange one, like a rubber fuck at a highway accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said the truth is strange to fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really can't understand how a fictional version of this documentary version will be released this year. How can you improve it? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin remove themselves from the New York Society and hide them in the Hampton's. In the process, they become reclosures and are best described as "crazy cat ladies." They would have remained hidden if the city did not condemn the property for the dirt and subsequent salvation of Jackie. This movie was done after that rescue. Already, you can't help but think, "how bad was that?" It is a glimpse of the high society of the dark side, and it is quite fascinating.
