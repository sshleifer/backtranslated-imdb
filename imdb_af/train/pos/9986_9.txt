As one of the few Canadians who did not read the high school book, I thought I would add my comment. To see the movie without knowing the story in advance did not detract from the film in any way. The characters have so many complexities, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions on the lives of the characters, rather than giving an opinion. You can love them or not, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I recommend it.
