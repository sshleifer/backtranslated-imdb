This movie is so misunderstood, it's not even funny. If you think to see this one for the shooting, stay clear. This one deals with the consequences and trauma that survivors have to endure. Even the detectives are looking for the answer we all do ... WHY? Fantastic of the two leading ladies, seeing how those we ignore are affected by the same things we are affected by. Yes, the language is sometimes difficult, but it fits the characters well. There are a few loose points left or unanswered, but all the movies have it. The main issues are addressed and this movie makes a big statement about how we all feel adults after such big incidents. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
