It takes patience to come through David Lynch's eccentric, but - for a change - Alvin Straight's life-affirming chronicle, but stick with it. While moving so slowly as Straight's John Deere, when he meets the strangers next to his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful regret and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth holds his career with the year's most sincere performance, sad and poetic, diligent and caring. And Sissy Spacek adapts to him as his "slow" daughter Rose, who suffers from her own private loss while caring for dad. Rarely did a modern film preach the family so positively.
