Yes, it's on top, yes, it's a little clicked and yes, Constance Marie is a total babe and is worth seeing again and again! The jokes and gags can get old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still nice to watch. Being a family program, the humor was burned down and the authors included family values ​​and ideas among the gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Don't take him seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he doesn't intend to be serious about his character or a fool of virtue. His outbursts and shouts of joy are hilarious ... <br /> <br /> I must say that the one big, dark, bitter spot is Benny. I hate the character ... so much so that every time she is over 30 seconds, I just push the TV so I don't have to hear her. There is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes. As a mother she must be the worst there and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, as the character, will be such a deplorable person for so long. <br /> <br /> Even though I am chosen to see Benny, I think to myself: see she is much better than watching the Bill Engvall Show. Now there's a bad sitting ...
