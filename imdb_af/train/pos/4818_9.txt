I always have a bit of distrust before I look at the British magazines, because I usually find ceaseless and boring screens (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl, for example), but with beautiful production design, European landscapes and the thick British accent that sets the movies to put artistic value they don't really have. Fortunately, the excellent movie The Young Victoria does not fall into that situation and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation due to its fascinating story, the excellent performances of Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and the costumes and places unexpectedly the movie pretty rich in view. And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually don't pay too much attention to those details. <br /> <br /> "Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, not just on the social aspect but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural ones.B I didn't know much about the origins of that era, and perhaps I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that made the landing of the modern era so great. I also liked the way Queen Victoria was portrayed as a young and intelligent monarch, whose decisions were not always good, but at least inspired by good intentions. I also found the portrayal of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellectuals as well as in the emotions it evokes. The only failure I found on this movie is that scriptwriter Julian Fellowes uses a few clicks from the romantic theater on the love story, something that looks a bit out of place on his screenplay. /> <br /> I loved the Young Victoria very much, and I was pleasantly surprised. I hope more magazines will follow the example of this movie: the costumes and landscapes should work as supporting an interesting story rather than replacing it.
