Kurt Russell IS Elvis, simple and simple. His dedication to this role has led to what I think, the best movie bio ever. If you are an Elvis fan, see it if you can. <br /> <br /> Two years after Elvis's death, the made television film was made. <br /> <br /> One board, there are two versions - one in 180 minutes and one in 117 minutes. The only one watching is the longer one. The shorter one worked out more than one hour of footage. It just doesn't work because the screens in it often depend on the screens being cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis's childhood through his rise as entertainment's greatest star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are excellent as Elvis's parents. And Pat Hingle delivers a very competent colleague Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the King!
