I'm surprised we even see a nasal sore criticizing this old movie. We don't usually get good opera movies, and here's a really great opera version. Understandably, the visuals are not great. It's dated. But as an opera, it cannot be denied; and I'm an opera buffalo. I can't sync one lip sync; If we didn't know what Tebaldi was in the sound, nothing would convince me it wasn't Sophia Loren. She does everything with flair! Her dark makeup is good; and she brought the role to the beautiful life! The rest of the role play is wonderful, just like the beautiful ballet group. Most of the actors are excellent; Loren is wonderful. Her competitor Amneris is also great. Everyone who doesn't care about this 1953 job has been shamed. Verdi would enjoy it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
