This movie was better than the average action movie and in that respect they succeeded. This movie features spectacular cinematography with spectacular mountain cuts and heights, a very fine Stallone, which also offers a good show, an exciting plot and a wonderful show of its greatest villain, because he will really shock you with his evil ways . The movie does not stand up for a long time due to the poor screenplay. The plot and story calls for this movie to make Stallone an extra special person, much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters. They have chosen to make Stallone's character in this one, but it is good, but the style of the plot is weakened. The excitement factor deteriorates. The dialogue was also exaggerated and indifferent. The writing had to be more. realistic and less talky. Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scene. The filmmakers had to be more careful about how they had hit the shooting hits and missed. They had to continue. the quality of the screens of the shooting sequence during the airplane flying early in the film. Instead, they decided to drain a lot of the shooting sequence (ala "A-Team" series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain top. This movie had a lot of potential. Crisis series, better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky style emotions / stallone determination would have taken this movie to a higher level. I know it wasn't Stallone's fault. feel the film's director wanted to show Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not as good as it was for his filmmaker. Create a good movie though ........
