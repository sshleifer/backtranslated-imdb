Just like Final Fantasy, CG brought a whole new level, it's a rebirth for movement. No movie or cartoon, this film looks like a tribute to Film Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoon artists. You see Paris as it can almost be, the characters look as real as you and me. They shine, travel, shake like real actors in a way never before reached. <br /> <br /> Don't see it with the hope of finding a mind-blower. You will probably work it out before coming halfway out of the movie. The scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to well-known thrillers, but it is certainly bliss for the eyes.
