I only saw this movie ten years ago and I thought it was very funny indeed. It wasn't as bad as some critics make it. The fact that it was written by the usually trusted John Hughes shows that you can expect at least some funny dialogue. (Incidentally, I think too. Weird Science is pretty good, also written by Hughes in lightning speed.) The film has a very colored look to use all the primary colors - red, yellow, etc. - which it looks like look unique. The throw is also very good. The prudish Bunny Packard and the devil-owned Delores Salk are an exception. <br /> <br /> The movie definitely has a bit dated but I personally prefer it to all the other 'Lampoon' series.
