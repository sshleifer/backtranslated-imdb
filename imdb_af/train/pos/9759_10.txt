I believe I got this movie when I was a young goat. I remember watching it as a child, but I never found the movie. I remember good uncle Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck. But one day when I was away from my home, I found it. We are reunited. I'm now 17 years old. I'm still watching it. All the time actually. It's one of the funniest and touching movies I've ever seen and enjoyed. And personally, I think they should make a successor. Mmm, yes a sequel indeed. Now I'm even considering getting the captain bird tattooed somewhere on my body!
