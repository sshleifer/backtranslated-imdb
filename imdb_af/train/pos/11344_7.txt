Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw it in the movie at age 4 and I love and live memories of it. If you see it as an adult, you can catch the references that have passed over the heads of the target audience, such as the little where Jimmy's gray witch wedge is cut off and Witch Hazel (Cass) cuts "I knew she had brown roots ! ". Of course, this is strongly influenced by the flowering culture of the time, and in some ways quite progressive. The Track Different, for example, sends a clear message to the young viewers about yourself, not running the pack, and cherishing what's different from yourself. It can be a national anthem for the gay community, it must be a good job. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all big like witches, and the Living Island throw gives it all its limitations on their character packs (include Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There are quite a few shows in this movie - there is nothing really subtle and when Jack Wild has to express his concern for the abducted residents of Living Island, it's very little to shout. It is drama and comedy spread with a trowel. As I think about it, I can never stand the whistle. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, especially the above, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild's touch if I could. In addition, it is now on CD of the tasteful people at El Records in London. See here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
