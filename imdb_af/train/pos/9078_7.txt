Overall, the plot was much better than I expected. The laugh track was sometimes a bit annoying and tended to get in the way; However, there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make it up. My biggest surprise was finding the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not offered in the best light in the earlier promotions, but its character is pretty good in the pilot. There is plenty of candy to please just about anyone and all the usual characters look like the task ahead. Now, if the writers can only live up to what they started.
