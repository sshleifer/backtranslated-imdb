With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do, you'll probably find much to appreciate. I know I did it. The story is interesting and about time traveling. A virus killed many people in 1997 and a man named Cole (Bruce Willis) was sent back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he was arrested and placed in a mental hospital. There he met Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who did not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappeared from the mental hospital while being dressed in a room and reappearing in 1996, Kathryn began to believe Cole's stories. br /> <br /> The movie is constantly playing with time. Cole makes a call and leaves a message in 1996, it is recorded in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, someone just seconds after the call appeared. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you need to pay attention. You can ask questions, but since you can't get an answer yourself, it's better to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkeys' work as sci-fi, with some good images and a dark atmosphere. , and it works as a thrill. You are never sure of what will happen next and it helps the movie. Perhaps there are some flaws in the story, but since it's about a fictional thing like the time you travel, you have to accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.
