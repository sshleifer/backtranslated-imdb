This is the ultimate one-man show in which Eddie Murphy is at its best. Just forget the Nutty Professor and the Distinguished Gentlemen, this is real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (as if gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it's also pretty fun to make fun of artists who were very popular at that time. My favorite act is the one he plays with his family at his annual BBQ and his drunk dad and aunt Bunny are playing down the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel! If you watch the sequel 'Raw', don't be disappointed. It's pretty good, but does not correspond to 'Delirious'.
