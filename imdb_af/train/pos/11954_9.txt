Big movie, enough laugh and action for any audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who posted on this movie has taken it upon themselves to encourage Woody Allen and not comment on the movie, here I am. /> <br /> The movie follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, as they gave a hint to them by the ghost of a recent late English reporter. Their search takes them to the murderer's home, and finally to a somewhat tragic end. But don't let the plot fool you, the movie is really hilarious and the play is great. <br /> <br /> The directors seem to reach a certain age, they really get things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to be the most imaginative of their respective careers. Also, if you watch the movie in a packing theater, you can only say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to make a real return. The second he heard on the screen relieved. There is just something about the man and he really appears in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
