When I first saw this movie, I thought it was the typical love of your neighbor. The more the movie goes on, the more I become involved. Acting is wonderful from both actors, direction was wonderful, the story is unusual. Shouting my eyes, first in my life for a movie. A real must in any serious videoteque. 11 out of 10
