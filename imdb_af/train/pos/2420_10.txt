If you enjoy the subtle (yes, I have subtle) actions and reactions of John Candy, you can't help this movie (pronounced "fillum" from Salvatore DiPasquale). The unconscious (and uninformed) viewer always saw Candy as a broad actor - a great buffoon. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when he had the opportunity, he could really be razor-sharp and fairly subtle. It's too bad, he threw so many roles that just showed his broad side, because we'll never see others again. Oh yes, the movie. One can watch "Go Berserk" over and over (I know I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack." It's just as well. The plot, though a little over, is actually pretty deep for some kind. It allows Candy and the always underrated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to reflect Candy ... and deny them HARD. Definitely a look for anyone who enjoyed SCTV or Candy's other work.
