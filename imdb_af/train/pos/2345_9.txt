I really enjoyed the first episode and look forward to more. A bit soft on the crime front (it's almost a memory and not terribly tense), but thought the romance corner was wonderfully charming. Will be sure again! <br /> <br /> I hope they will play a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses, and this is somewhat underutilized this time around. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched I think) is very sweet and bubbly and so beautiful and sweet instead of stupid and annoying. It is very nice. <br /> <br /> Look it up.
