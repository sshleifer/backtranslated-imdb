I have to hand it over to the creative team behind this "American Pie" movie. "Direct To DVD" is typically synonymous with cheap, unauthorized movies. Still, I was pleasantly surprised last year when I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to produce a racial, yet funny, small film. This year they offer the sequel, "Beta House". That's the truth, "Beta House" makes the first few "American Pie" movies like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> It's no grip, tasteless, laugh-out loud. Sure, the story is a little thin, but it's the beauty of the whole thing. Within the first 10 minutes we are introduced to all the main characters, the new supporting characters, a handful of gags, meet the villains and determine the general plot line. With everything out of the way, the movie becomes an unlimited ride. The gags are big and they have NOT held back in this one. I speak male semen, urine, dildos, chicks-with-dicks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays, and more. Not to mention the fact that there is no minute without boobs or a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Back from "The Naked Mile" is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role to the last few films). The whole casting works well. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great energy and screen presence. I predict good things to him. The film is also loaded with good movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the movie for me was "The Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel at home with 'Beta House'. It really pushes the limits of good taste, but in the end it's pretty damn funny.
