Although it's not as creepy as it is the cult classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I really like this one better. This is due to the faster pace, better settings and the cool 80's soundtrack. It's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci. The zombies don't look as nasty as in ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It is pretty well made, but it certainly has a part of chastity; For example, some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as ninjas. Some are brainedad while others say funny lines, but what does consistency expect when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How rad is that? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. It will probably also satisfy most action movie fans. See also Zombi 4.
