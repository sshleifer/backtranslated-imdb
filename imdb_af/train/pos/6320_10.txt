The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in one movie is unbelievable without actually seeing it. But this movie took me away. It wasn't what I was expecting. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember I couldn't stop laughing !!! And it wasn't just the role it did for me. The writing was incredibly written. Every time you expect something to happen, it didn't happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it fits the whole scene of the movie instead of coming out as predictive. The cinematography, along with the set, was also absolutely beautiful. I really can't say anything bad about this movie! Eventually, I'll have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!
