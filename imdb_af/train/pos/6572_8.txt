One of my favorite films for a number of years was "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now i can't carry a movie in which he had a hand in. <br /> <br /> The adventures of Jake Speed ​​actually play toys with some themes similar to those in Last ... Hero; So I was happy to find it on DVD, so I could see how these themes played so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot-inside-plot" that includes white slavery during an African civil war, it's not an action movie. The plot inside the "plot-in-a-plot" is actually a question that the film does not intend to solve. Is Jake Speed ​​a real person helping the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest that this is not all that is clearly defined in the movie, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are fully aware. The film is thus a representation of what audiences might want from such a fictional "adventure story" universe. This is actually a rich theme, the potential hardship is relieved by the film's friendly and campus sense of humor. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses for the movie - especially cinematography, which looks like a movie. Show. And the pacing sometimes softens. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live but stupid. And I just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually in a novel. <br /> <br /> Stop under various views - good show!
