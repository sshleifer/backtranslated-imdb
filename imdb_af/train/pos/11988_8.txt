I watched this show when I was a girl. When I think about it, I just remember it vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and theme song. In addition, everyone is ideally thrown. The writing was also very strong. The performances were also top grade. I hope some network will bring it back so I can see every episode. Before I upload it, I'd like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory, though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, finally, if some networks ever bring it back, I hope you'll catch it one day before it's going well.
