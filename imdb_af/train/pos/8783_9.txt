Mr. Jim, not really a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. But as it has been said, the boxers are a real eye-opener for the modern viewer. There are no 12 round points decisions here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title. Flynn is well-suited for the role of suave but unpredictable Corbett. His opponent, John Sullivan, is even better, but an effervescent of the old school played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the movie is a man pushing his big chance. Corbett leaves his everyday life and builds a new persona than Mr. Jim. Jim is a chancellor who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and selfish. Sullivan's heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute, but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of action and excitement and a wonderful ending with the required salvation for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
