I really enjoyed this movie of the relationships that sometimes developed between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them. Brando is contemptuous of the Japanese (who is of course considered WW2) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is okay (I'm not a big fan of his play) and the film is wonderful throughout. Red Knobs received an Oscar for his touch from another GI that falls in love with Japan (although Japanese women playing across the street have also done a remarkable job). <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil it. But the movie is a good one to watch with boxing tissues. <br /> <br /> This movie can say something and entertain at the same time. Mostly underestimated jewel.
