I literally prepared to hate this movie, so believe me if I say this movie is worth seeing. Overall, the story and gags were confronted, but the film had the charm and finesse to pull them off. That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to show his boss / future father-in-law and co-workers he's scratching himself is not terribly intelligent, but it made me hear the madness of the laugh . Very little of the film's gags are a high head, but they made me laugh. As I said, the movie has charm and charm a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are also nice. I must say I wish I saw more of James Brolin's character, seeing in the few scenes he was in. Plus, I admire a romantic comedy that doesn't bother to make the woman's character (who acts as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is almost unlikely, and there is never a scene where I thought to myself: "Why did he first want to marry her?" The end is Hollywood-ish, but it could have been much more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I didn't have a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's mainstream work. I loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I couldn't help but feel disappointed to see him in this dull role. And he never looks comfortable in these dull rolls. Even in this movie he does not seem quite comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and processes each scene effectively. But I still miss his work in independent movies. Julia Stiles proves why she loves so much. Of course she is a very nice girl with a radiant smile that makes me faint, but she also has a unique charm and apparently good personality. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out. I don't know the actress's name, but the woman playing the drunken grandmother is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small role, and she is always nice to watch, and I wish she got better roles. I loved her so much in 'Airplane' and 'Lost in America' that it's a shame she doesn't have the same opportunities to trade her skills. <br /> <br /> Don't be terrified by the terrible trailers and even more horrible checkout records. It's a funny, charming movie. Romantic comedies are becoming so predictable these days that it feels as if the genre itself is ready to be flushed in the toilet, so it's always a good one among all these bad apples. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
