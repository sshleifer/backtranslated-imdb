Standard rises to famous story that has some high points. Number one, Lonette McKee as Sister who delivers a beautiful star performance. The fact that she never became a big sensation after this is outside of me. Unfortunately, she is a supportive character and we must be forced to focus on Irena Carter's bare character, Sparkle, whose rise to fame is easy, dull and unconvincing. But when the girls go on stage and act, the movie comes back to life. The original music by Curis Mayfield should be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS band. The picture quality was pretty low as well as the production value I guess. All in all, it's worth it.
