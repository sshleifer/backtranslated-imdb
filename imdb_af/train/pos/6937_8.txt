This moving western twisted the story of the well-known rifle of the early west sought by everyone and everyone. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout, just to lose it in a robbery. The story describes Stewart's quest for the gun and a certain man through the movie. The gun changes hands from time to time, as if the owner is committed to losing it by force. The photo has a lot of action and tension as Stewart closes his quarry. A good film supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters is overlooked here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teens in later years, have short but good roles.
