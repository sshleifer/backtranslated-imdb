For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Overcoming racism, struggling through life and proving itself is not just an ordinary "cookie". Carl Brashear is a wonderful character to play, which Cuba places in his best light, the best performance in his life. The Niro, who is a living legend, gives something to the movie. He played his character in the film, but he does so much good work on this movie, good performance. And the look of beautiful Charlize was and is always a big plus for every movie. So if you haven't seen this movie, I'm highly recommended to those who love courage, greatness that inspires. You must watch this great drama. My vote 9/10.
