The secret of Kells is an independent, animated feature that gives us one of the fabulous stories around the book of Kells, an enlightened manuscript from the Middle Ages with the four New Testament Gospels. I didn't know this book actually exists, but to know it now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier. There are some stories and ideas that revolve around how the book came, who wrote it and how it survived over 1000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives in Kells Abbey in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (pronounced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach builds a massive wall to protect the abbey from the villagers and monks. Brendan doesn't love the wall, nor the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, something Abbot Cellach has no more time to do. He fears the "Northmen", those who plunder and leave villages empty and burned. <br /> <br /> One day, a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland. It's Brother Aidan, a very wise man who brings a special book that's not finished yet. Abbot Cellach gives him permission to stay and Brendan comes with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First, he needs ink for the book, but he needs specific berries. The only way to get there is to venture outside the walls and into the forest, an area beyond Brendan. As he is the only chance Aidan can continue his work, he decides to cut out and return the berries before his uncle sees his absence. <br /> <br /> In the bush, Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. She left Brendan to the berries and along the way touched his company. She warned him of the impending danger in the dark and didn't fall with it. There are things worse than Vikings out there. From there Brendan comes with more challenges with the book and the imminent security of the invasion. <br /> <br /> I love the story a lot more now that I know what it's all about. If you now know what the book of Kells is and what it contains, the animation makes perfect sense. I am sure you have seen hundreds of years ago photographs or copies of old texts, with free borders, colorful pictures and exorbitant patterns, creatures and writings decorating the pages. Much like the opening styles of Disney's The Sword in the Stone. The animation here contains many similar designs and patterns. It creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to overcome each other. <br /> <br /> I couldn't take my eyes off the incredible detail. This is one of the best 2D animations I've seen in years. It is lively, stimulating and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by designs, doodles and patterns in trees, on the walls, and floating around in the air. It raises the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think the end could be a bit more elaborate. With a maturity of just 75 minutes, I think there might have been something special in the final act. It does not provide much information, nor does it indicate the meaning of the book. We are reminded that it is important but never fully understood. We are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. It was really the only missing part of the movie. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting, although the animation was completely obsolete. <br /> <br /> I think it's good to some extent. So far, the animation can carry a movie before it becomes short. The story is missing some parts, but it is an interesting approach to a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend briefly exploring the Book of Kells just to get an idea of ​​what I and this movie is talking about. I think that will help your viewing experience much more. It is a very impressive and beautifully illustrated movie that should definitely not be missed.
