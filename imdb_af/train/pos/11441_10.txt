As a person seeking a 'professional' person with a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my common sense has always been kept up to scratch in the power of things more artistic. My post-graduation classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and art drawing that also included silk screen. <br /> <br /> I also keep healthy. with jogging, walking and recently, walking to remote destinations in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and walking get one close to earth with the time to stop and watch and listen and also to photograph or record sounds. <br /> <br /> Within that background, I was busy with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was also impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy, as well as the skills and smoothness of director / film Thomas Riedelsheimer. I couldn't really separate Goldsworthy's art with Riedelsheimer's camera path. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Great. Great.
