With all these things down at the moment with MJ, I started listening to his music, watching the strange documentary here and there, watching The Wiz and watching Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get some insight into this man I thought was really cool in the eighties, just to think whether he was guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, sharing feature movie I remember watching at the theater when it was originally released. Some of them have subtle messages about MJ's feelings towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs is bad mug. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, but of course it's about Michael Jackson unless you're remotely like MJ Anyway you're going to hate it and find it boring. Some may call MJ a spouse for permission to make this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans will say he made it to the fans. If it really is nice of him. <br /> <br /> The real feature film movie when it finally starts is just 20 minutes or more, with the exception of the Smooth Criminal series and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lover. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is outside me. Because MJ heard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character refused to want people to know it was he who provided drugs, etc., so I don't know, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> Lots of cool stuff in this, like MJ, turns into a car and a robot and the whole Speed ​​Demon sequence. Also, the director had to have the patience of a saint if it filmed the kiddy bath sequence, as the directors hate to work with one child, let alone a lot of them who perform a complex dance scene . <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this movie is for people who keep MJ at some level (which I think most people are). If not, then stay away. It tries and gives a healthy message and ironic. MJ's best friend in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I have given to this topic ... Well, I don't know, because people might be behind closed doors, I know this for a fact. He is either a very beautiful but stupid man or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.
