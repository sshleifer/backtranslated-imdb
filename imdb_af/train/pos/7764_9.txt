Another classic study of the effect of wealth on a southern family is portrayed masterfully in the writing on the wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, an airplane, calls it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always got him out of trouble. Mitch completed college, Kyle was thrown out. Mitch is not a rich house. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls most of everything in town. <br /> <br /> While in NJ, Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, played by Lauren Bacall. After a whirlwind romance he married her and brought her home. There she met her father-in-law who warned her how difficult Kyle could be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow. The Bacall character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp as it ever was, played to the best by Dorothy Malone, the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the loyal friend. </ br /> <br /> A year of dedicated happiness for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by the doctor that he cannot have children. This is when his wife reveals to him that she is indeed pregnant, Kyle, thinks Mitch's child is, a drunken madness and accidentally shot in an unforgettable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who always loved Mitch, tries, but is unsuccessful in blaming Mitch for Kyle's death. In an unforgettable courtroom scene, Malone has taken all the steps to finally acknowledge that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Her Oscar was well deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for best supporting actor and lost in an angry victory by Anthony Quinn, like Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. br /> Douglas Sirk was the master of soap opera films of the 1950s. Written on the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
