This show was absolutely fantastic and I always look forward to watching. All the characters were funny and fantastic in their own way, each episode was constantly laughing, and it was totally entertaining and different from many other programs. Everybody was just absolutely crazy and breathtakingly funny, that you can't help but love this show. There were some dead weight episodes, but that '70s Show has always managed to create a kind of nice atmosphere, where it just really did. It doesn't matter. It was one of the best shows ever broadcast, and I will watch this show every time I can, because it never gets old, never gets unfriendly and never gets uninteresting.
