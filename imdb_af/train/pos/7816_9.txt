Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the Oscar-winning 'Gandhi', back in '83. I didn't know of any other work from her until I recently came across 'Cry Freedom', which was released in 1987. Although it may not be as popular as its Gandhi, it is just as gripping, if not more, and released when South Africa has not yet managed to get rid of the apartheid bonds. While most movies come across social issues after the event, I think this one released over time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book based on the movie was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the end of the 1970s. It follows the origins of Woods' friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can't suggest a better choice for the role. Washington evokes a natural charm and screen presence, which requires Biko's character. <br /> <br /> While Woods was initially against what he felt, black racism was spread by Biko, after meeting the man, he couldn't help getting drawn in his struggle and ideas. The bond between them becomes stronger and Woods and his family realize and become more sensitive to the fate of the people who represent Biko. <br /> <br /> Finally, tragedy ceases and Woods must now concentrate on escape from South Africa. Africa, with his book, so he can publish it and let the outside world know what's going on. The second half of the movie is a gripping story of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and keeps you on tenterhooks. <br /> <br /> There are also fun humorous dialogues. The scene between Biko and the courtroom attorney is an example. <br /> <br /> Attorney: Do you advocate violence? Biko: I advocate a confrontation. Attorney: Well, isn't that the violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I now have a confrontation, but I see no violence. <br /> <br /> There are, however, moments that bring you back to the horrors that the land has penetrated before better sentence prevailed. The scene where the army makes a protest by schoolchildren is daunting and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a must see. I suggest that those who are not familiar with Attenborough's work do not think about it. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make lives. I would prefer the latter any day.
