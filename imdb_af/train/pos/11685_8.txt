I really found this movie funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back in the middle of the 50-year-old white male body. He does not realize that his actions should change and continue to act as he did before. He listens to rap music, sings together, and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The right humor in this movie was the problem that this behavior entered into with the black community.
