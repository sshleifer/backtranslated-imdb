There are many kinds of reunion shows. One species is where old actors from mothballs are taken and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years. It has mixed results. "Back to Mayberry", despite folly, was good; "Return to Green Acres" as excrable (Eddie Albert uses a word for the script I won't repeat here, but it and the movie stink); "Salvation from Gilligan's Island" completed an essential gap in the story of the castaways, although the show itself was even stupid of a Gilligan's Island point. In most cases the scripts are weak; Sometimes there is a folly in the scriptures that are to know is ?? And in comedy it's almost always fatal that the characters know they're funny. New characters are introduced that don't fit the mix. In the main, these reunion shows are pretty poor. A second kind of reunion show is the kind where the cast sets aside its past, but sits, tells stories, reminds, interspersed with flashbacks of the shows. Then there are movies based on shows, which are rarely good; and movies based on the history of the show (`The Brady Bunch ', both of them happen, with different results). <br /> <br /> "Back to the Batcave" uses almost all of the above, with a wonderfully twisted point of view, which shows the best of the reunion, and raised the bar for the other. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward and call for a performance of the original Batmobile. While they were there, the car was stolen. <br /> <br /> The Adam West of the movie is a man who has been denied. He called Jerry, his butler, 'Alfred'. He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to move to the parking garage. He is obsessed with being a crime fighter, while he is just an excited actor. When the Batmobile is stolen, he not only believes his duty as a crime fighter to recover, he enters Burt Ward as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The pursuit is largely loquacious, with West and Ward reminiscing over the old days. It is broken by "flashbacks" with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. The modern plays and the "flashbacks" both have the miserable lack of reality that maintained the performance. There are also gags that show West can entertain him. In Ward's book about his time at the show, he frankly said about West's libido and also he is a skirt (West makes Ward pay for everything in their quest, off tips and bus tickets). The clues they follow, the characters they meet (even in flashback) all fit with the age range of the old series, and there are several homages, including a fist fight with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is very funny and done with great panache. There are also cameos by Julie Newmar (who seems to have had one facelift too) and Frank Gorshin, who reminds us why he follows such a cult. Gorshin will be the mystery when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, has long been forgotten. The movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax. <br /> <br /> Is this a model for reunion programs? Unfortunately, there is little that fits the pattern. This show had actors playing their old characters; young actors playing a movie about making the show; actors West and Ward recall; and a contemporary film featuring the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West. It has everything. If you loved the old show, it's the stop on the bottle.
