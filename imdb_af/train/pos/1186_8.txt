There has been much talk of "psychological Western", but it is one of the few people who really are in that genre. It has big stars that perform very well, but it is the director who makes it such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype to play a finished retired buffalo hunter best-honored in the West. Robert Taylor plays the start (unlike the usual young start-up, Taylor's character is also middle-aged), who wants to kill buffalo, and Granger wants to attract him into business. They hire two other big names actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, as their skinners. Granger is being haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing he can blame if they die, know if they have died, the Native American lifestyle will suffer. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic gentleness, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern film created by nerds and dorks. He is uncertain and needs human company. Yet he won't stop at murder. The end juxtaposed the two, with a surprising conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well portrayed.
