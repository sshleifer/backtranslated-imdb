I only saw detention last night and I liked what I saw. It was a cool, fine movie. Dolph looked excellent on the Bike. He also watched well in this movie compared to his other recent movies. He is now in a good shape. The story was good and the other actors were also wise. I won't call this movie its best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But it also had its part in Probleme. The first one was the way bullets drove around and even when they were shot at an empty space, they missed the target. They had to escape the ppl in a better way. Another problem I had was the way the students swore. I don't know in which school the students can swear before their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in number. There must have been more bad guys. Last problem was definitely the set of stockings, but it was because of the small budget. Overall the movie was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I would recommend others to see it. P.S. Now you're a DEATH knocker. (Some one-liners were also cool) <br /> <br />
