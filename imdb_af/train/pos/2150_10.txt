If you are tired of movies that are trying too hard to be fairy tales (the "Pretty Woman" variety of love story), here is a beautiful movie in which a Japanese businessman is detached from his robot, careless life when he falls in love. With dance. Wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is very funny and moving at once.
