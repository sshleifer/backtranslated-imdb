For the start, it's a very funny movie with some crazy characters running around laughing (watching the two Russian insects). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney storyline, but it's one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo evolution to eventually rise to the locusts. And it also has some great voice remnants by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course) ... but actually the most wonderful thing about this movie is the animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the guys and girls at Pixar made it all look realistic. All in all, a very nice piece of work. This is the best animation by Disney since Aladdin.
