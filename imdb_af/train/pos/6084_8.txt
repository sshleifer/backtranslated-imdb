I was pleased with the role players of well-known players. The story is one of the remarks for a case, even if you're at personal risk. At a time when violence and pain are often in the movie, this movie focuses on the old-fashioned good policeman. Although similar plots have been repeatedly done, these guys pull it off well. Kick back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master to take over a movie.
