Finally, we have a category III movie for the summer season before us. Made from equal parts cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog not only benefits from a suitable title, but also flexible direction, excellent cinematography and respectful performances of the most involved. Of course, there must be a catch, which appears here in the form of various shiny contradictions, but said that DBD represents the adult spirit that we would like to see from the HK mainstream. <br /> <br /> It also reflects the recurring returns of Edison Chen, who has been absent since the initial D debacle of a year ago. Chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the movie, but would have had it rough without the opposite of Sam Lee, whose luck for the interaction between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) I saw from him since Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duo makes Dog Bite Dog, and hopefully Edison will now get an easy break: his touch-transformed princess D projects into the Infernal Business case, and still he " a rare appearance. <br /> <br /> Usually, DBD starts some fascinating images, plays beautiful tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack increases this atmospheric effect, adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys. Much of the resulting combination is probably related to author Matt Chow, who was previously involved in abominable Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains many features that are withdrawn from the horror project, namely the extract of urbanscapes and a penetrating air of something hidden around the corner. <br /> <br /> Rest assured, but it's not a horror movie. A road previously hit by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, even though it is a mile more perverse. Replacing Daniel Wu's reluctant mainland killer pattern, Edison, is playing an anonymous killing machine coming from Cambodia's underworld. The Hong Kong way of targeting a single target ensures that the almost silent assassin immediately arrives on business, a process depicted cold by the film's brilliant footage. <br /> <br /> Although childhood is weaned to become professional. killer, Edison's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail picked up by a CID team sent to investigate. This meeting has a nice cameo by mob-movie stalwart Lam Suet, and good support from TV star Wayne Lai. However, Sam Lee's apostate officer, Wai, leads the charge and reveals himself as a highly disturbed individual but excellent police spokesman. We are gradually learning Wai's inner conflict from his father's police corruption background, learning demons that are useful in the relentless pursuit that arises. <br /> <br /> A small body number is suggested, as Edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no no. . There is quite a lot of violence in the store, although gore itself is burned in places, and adult language is just a sign. Once again, no nudity, which leads to Cat III's distractions, is handed over a bit in a hurry. Yet DBD is a relatively mature theater release, and we welcome its arrival. <br /> <br /> In the battles, stabbing, hack and shooting, even a career killer needs a romance and, like Daniel Wu, Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, so indifferent. Chen gets a sweetheart, beautifully done by new coming Pei Pei. Her nameless character (much anonymity in this one) meets Edison's on a strange deserted landfill, abusing her father to the point of repulsive madness and longing for escape. When the killer HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they go along, love flowing on the way. While the movie does not hang on to love-killing things, our hearts go out to Pei Pei's tragic character and her endless suffering. She makes the crook but brave protagonist incredibly good and establishes that there are no good or bad guys here, invented by the highly disillusioned final. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes recent suspense thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers likely to surpass most accounts by Dog Bite Dog's sinister behavior. Cheang manages to make DBD flow continuously, and taking into account the many parts at stake here, critical standards are set up by people like Johnny To in its watershed, the century missionary station. A few glitches occur, because Edison miraculously kicks a shot at the chest, but it is highly forgiven. <br /> <br /> Mark triumphant returns for two young talented artists of the kind who need Hong Kong if we want to return the city's film stories, Dog Bite Dog doesn't stand for story. The forte lies in strong depictions and style, built on the strength of the muscle muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse. <br /> <br /> HK has a long, revered tradition of stories to do with the city's night alter-ego, something Dog Bite Dog lovingly maintains, which is a solid run unless it's an absolute masterpiece is not. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
