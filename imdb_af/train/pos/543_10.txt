This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none. I love how Stanley just dumps the women in the dam. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for years and he blew me away. It's a mix of horror, drama and romance, not so much comedy. His anger, but a beautiful view, got me there and there. It looks in his eyes, I'll never forget. There's something about him, I can't describe.
