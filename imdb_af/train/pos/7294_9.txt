After reading several comments, I felt I had to add two cents to me as well. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I've ever seen. I got the chance to see it at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short time. The story is focused on a young girl being victimized by her abusive father. She soon had the choice to "stop" him from a demon played by Eric Etebari of Witchblade. After watching the show, I was incredibly impressed with how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very convincing. The acting was absolutely beautiful. The girl was okay and the dad was decent. There is also death in those who walk around the girl until she can escape her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely blowing. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare that you can see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtakingly comparable to any large feature film. It is not to say that it is not without its faults. I thought it took a bit to go and the intro was a bit long. But in my mind it got stuck after watching it. There are many shorts with this level of quality.
