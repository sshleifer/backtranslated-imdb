The story of Baghdad's boyish (as it was earlier spelled) lured Raoul Walsh's filmmakers in 1924, who died first, quietly, of "Thief of Baghdad", to less intrusive, more recent attempts. However, the 1940 version remains the best, which for its time was a spectacular, magical panoply of top-quality special effects. These effects still work their charms. <br /> <br /> At least six directors are listed for the technicolor movie Sabu as the junior, Abu, John Justin, as well as the in love Monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and by the evil visor Jaffar pursued, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genius is much maintained by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad was treacherously deposited by Jaffar and when he was later arrested by the treacherous snake, he and the son, Abu, suffered clearly incompetent. Ahmad is blinded and Abu becomes a sweet mutt. Their adventures through the happily decorated Hollywood rugs are fun, but the special effects make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from a witchcraft to the giant genius that emerged from a bottle from a bottle. Tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard also had the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and sought-after technical wizard careers.) <br /> <br /> Duprez is exceptionally beautiful while little calls for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romance that is not moved by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he is very good. For a movie intended for both children and adults, there is a good amount of violence, but of the bloodless kind. Yet I don't think anyone under eight should see "Thief of Baghdad". <br /> <br /> This movie makes periodic appearances on TV, but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few young people present. It was wonderful that computer-visited children responded to a prosperous community with cheering and applause for special effects that should look primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Baghdad thief" is a pre-war Hollywood classic of a time when strong production values ​​often led to persistently attractive and important releases. It is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
