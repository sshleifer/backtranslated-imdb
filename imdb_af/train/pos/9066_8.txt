~ ~ I was able to watch this movie on an early watch pass this morning ~~ <br /> <br /> I'm a mother of 2 kids, ranging from 11 to 6. So I'm sure many parents can related to many "kids" movies. It was refreshing for me. I did not read this book, so I do not know whether it remained true or not. But it certainly took the factor of magnitude to a high level. This is the story of the "new" child in town and it just happens that there is a group of boys who have formed a club of all kinds and like to pick on children .... sounds familiar? Didn't we all suffer from this? He has the little brother he can't stand and parents he is ashamed of. What I had the most was to see how each character was completely different from the ones everyone else exhibited. The bully (why do they always make the bully a red head? My daughter has red hair! And she's not a bully!) Lol is a big bully, who finds himself shouted by his own big brother . It has twists and turns and you fall in love with everyone and find yourself straight for all the characters! Even the parents, good relationship between father and son. All around pleasant, sweet, funny, rough, etc ...... Take your kids !!! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
