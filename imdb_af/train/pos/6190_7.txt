Fay Grim is continuing a story that started ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I didn't see the previous movie, and I don't know if it's a good thing or not. I can only see the current film on its own merits. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's style of filmmaking is something you like or not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry ironic humor really reacts to me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of sharply written intelligent parody that laughed at myself and many in the Melbourne International Film Festival audience. For the first half of the film, it was relentless and rendered with a stalemate. It's a humorous style that unfortunately is lacking in theaters and a welcome relief for the inexorable teenage comedies that Hollywood is pumping out like pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, humor begins to be thin as the movie morphs in an international espionage / conspiracy player. Whether it was Hartley's intention or whether he had challenged ideas, is not clear, but I think a bit of editing or rewriting to cut fifteen minutes off the film would retain the original momentum of the movie. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all played good support roles. The film's footage was nice (in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film was well written and I enjoyed it very much. If you like Hartley's previous job, you'll probably like this.
