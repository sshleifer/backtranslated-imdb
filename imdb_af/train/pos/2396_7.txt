This is a very entertaining film following the rehearsal process of a NY production by Macbeth. Although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best if it doesn't take too much. Recognizable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury are doing great work, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where Banquo (John Elsen )'s "murder" is being rehearsed. Probably a more entertaining movie for those involved in the theater, but everyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
