This is an important film. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There is a lot to do here. The director would like to dismantle some of the more tired movie conventions. Unlike a very recent American cinema, this movie is interested in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD contains many bonus features, and there are two commentaries that the film explains to the viewers who are still shaking after an initial performance. When the film was screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry. It's a Sunday morning movie, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated viewer it is a treasure chest.
