This is a fantastic movie. probably the best movie I've ever seen. I look it over and over. I have to give it 10/10 stars, because, as I said, it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. This movie + Popcorn + Coke = Best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend it. First I saw it, I kept it that way, I bought it and now I own it and probably watch it every day. my boys like it and think it's the best movie ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I don't want to spoil all the movie so you can enjoy it after reading my text. Beautiful Movie Beautiful characters, beautiful story, and just good stuff. A must watch movie. hope you enjoyed my comment. <br /> <br /> Jim Make
