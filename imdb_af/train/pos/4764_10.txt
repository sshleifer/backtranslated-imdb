There are some remarks about this movie that say it's a bad and stupid and such an excellent actor, as Pierre Fresnay would not have accepted to do it. <br /> <br /> I think, just the opposite, that even if the movie is weird and poor, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it makes the movie something excellent. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very polemical scene about the dedication of wine in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who doesn't believe a priest? even a drowned one ?? can turn it into Christ's blood, the scene may be bizarre. But for someone educated in a Catholic framework, it is very emotional, even if it is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the younger priest is extremely shocking. But it performed very well. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder into something understandable into the temporary madness of his character, the tortured, depraved Morand who returns to his duty in this terrible way.
