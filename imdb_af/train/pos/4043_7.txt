Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I noticed a very disappointing movie geeks who loved Versus this debut movie or his third movie Azumi. I heard they were blood-soaked movies with swords and zombies and all kinds of goods. Frankly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I'm just right with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an end to the wall-to-wall action, Alive is not your choice. There is a lot of action, but it comes as pay for an hour-long character-based build. Personally, I think it's well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the plots are stupid as with many SCI-Fi action movies and I think the captions used by the term foreign object can be replaced with parasite for greater effect. This movie is brutal when it has to be so tired of heart, it doesn't have to apply. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget by mostly limiting all the action to one underground building (a sign of the cube) but the movie doesn't suffice. Another bonus for this movie is intense gothic imaginations that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream series. <br /> <br /> Rent it!
