Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie, and if you want an intense battle, turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sniper in the jungle that goes to rebels and drug bosses. Life is a bitch, so he gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to help on the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stuffed Anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Sure, it can be a bit long - who wants to walk through the jungle, but it's good, tense action when the time is right.
