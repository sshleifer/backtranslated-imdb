It is a story of Siberian townspeople from the early 20th century to the 60th. It's about passion and feelings, about the Russian soul and very romantic. This movie is NOT action packed, it flows slowly. In the second part one can find good songs - Russian romance. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example.
