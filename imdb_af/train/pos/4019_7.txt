To be this, I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, who made me even more anxious to watch this movie. I remember being an interview on Jay Leno, saying he has a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Yard" to be in this movie. So, of course, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove he was acting. I'm not going to persuade Snoop for his performance in "The Tenants." There are definitely better rappers / actors, like Mos Def, who could do more with his role. But the point is that Snoop did a "good" job. He doesn't seem to shake off his trademark movements and vocal ties, but it's even a problem Jack Nicholson has a problem. The point is that I find him convincing in the role, and captivating the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, although his subtle acting is likely to be overshadowed by Snoop's non-subtle acting. If I was a great reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help finding the characters and plot a bit fascinating. This aggravated me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work and help him criticize it. But you know what? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character was supposed to be flawed, like McDermott's, in his own way. My only slight criticism of the movie will be its end. For some reason it just rushed me too fast, though the resolution definitely made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than plot.
