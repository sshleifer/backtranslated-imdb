I always enjoyed seeing it when it appeared on television every year in the 60's. It's a typical Hollywood epic epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but so, it's an entertaining movie and a great movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who had the supporting role of Beluche in the '38 movie, is the director in his director's debut and swan song, as he never directed a movie before and would never want to. DeMille met a crew who recently worked on his 10 commandments to help Quinn exclude it, including co-producer Henry Wilcoxon, who was involved in the project during the year. Also from the 10 Commandments are writers, Jesse Lasky, film maker Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph. Lester received as a costume design team The Buccaneer's only Oscar nomination. A good team out here DeMille has set up Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future president-general Andrew Jackson. Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In just over two hours, it drags in some places, but finishes off with some great fighting scenes. I'll give it a 7.5 out of 10.
