I'm a writer working at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunch break companion - good, clean fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show. How innocent we were all (and how innocent is Diagnosis Murder). I especially enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like Joe Mannix. The bad guys are always caught, the good guys continue. The stars clearly enjoy themselves and have a ball without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> One beef: why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches? Amanda was too dizzy. It's hard to imagine her doing anything as horrible as an autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we haven't seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and family on our screens, especially. by lunchtime !!
