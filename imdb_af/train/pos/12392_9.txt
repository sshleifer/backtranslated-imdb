"The Second Beginning" as its title explains, we show the beginning of the end for humanity. Shortly before the matrix existed, this short anime written by the Wachowski shows us the world we could establish in the distant future, set at the beginning of the 21st century. The second renaissance is generally in common with human behavior. ; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second renaissance is no exception to this concept, but instead of a simple man versus machine layout, this story explains the struggle with which the machines are placed, the struggle for acceptance into a world controlled by humans. Where the matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second renaissance part 1 + 2 answers many questions raised by the original Matrix film, such as how the war broke out, how the sky became black, which led to the use of people as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01, which may apply to the upcoming Matrix Revolution movie. <br /> <br /> I won't give away too much of the story because I don't want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in the world of the matrix or just someone who interested in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
