I saw The Bourne Ultimatum with a friend last summer, and wow! I've seen the first two movies, and I liked it, but Ultimatum, I loved it. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia running with the CIA agent, trying to discover who he is. <br /> <br /> As I have already said, I loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything was just right and it fits well with other movies, but in every sense it was much better. <br /> <br /> Best stunts, motor hunters, actors and effects I've seen in an action movie all summer (surprising because of Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I wasn't "Not just action In this movie, Jason not only kills and runs. He has a soul and the audience feels like him, so drama is included. But that doesn't delay it. <br /> <br /> Of all the triangles that came out last summer, it was the best.
