Probably one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see it, I suggest you see "South Park" one of the funniest cartoons. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. Pure strips of genius. If you don't think it's funny then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
