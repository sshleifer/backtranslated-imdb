I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not even sure about that, but I think it was great and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and did come along well enough to spend the time they spent in the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were so different and yet clever story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship issues in good time. It requires 10 lines, but I just can't think of saying so, so I'll just rattle until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What I can say even more is long since I last saw it. I'm looking forward to seeing again, but it's not available.
