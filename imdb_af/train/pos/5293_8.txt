It's a very light comedy about a wonderful family who has a son named Pecker because he uses Peck at his food. Pecker likes taking all sorts of photos of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, MD, Te and manages the attention of a group of photo-art enthusiasts from New York. Pecker has a cute sister who just goes sugar over sugar and is actually an ADDICT, which takes spoons of sugar out of a bag. There are scenes men showing the lumps in their jocks with grinding movements and gals that do pretty much the same. It's pretty hard to keep up with this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie to give you a laugh at a simple picture made in 1998.
