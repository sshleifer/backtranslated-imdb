Poor start, solid waist, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this movie. I love Simon Pegg in the two movies I saw him in --- Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead. However, his role here has taken a very different turn. Showing his series as an actor, yet I really didn't have the same character as he was portrayed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor I call 'frustration comedy'. The so-called "jokes" and whites are actually nothing more than painful and uncomfortable moments. Like the Bean character, Rowan plays Atkinmson. There are a number of other comic actors who also portray similar characters. I don't mean bashing them here, but it won't. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you are like me and you don't like smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg shows such qualities for the first third of this movie. However, it gets better. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere based on a true story. Hmmm. Can be. The story of the film apparently became annoying, and in third place became a triumph of the "little guy". I don't need all the movies to be sugar and light --- but coincidentally, as this film has improved, it has become more and more a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, playing such a big role. I love "Iron Man", but was saddened by the fact that Bridges's character was a villain. Pure personal taste, of course, as his real thing was good. Nevertheless, he was a miracle here as the Vision of the Greater than Life, the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role I could really enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed it! I just wish I had arrived within 40 minutes and missed the start.
