WHEN FRIENDSHIP, it is, in my opinion, a very pleasant and kind heartbreaking drama about the effects of anorexia or bulimia. Any time when Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to raise myself. It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should be more cooperative about things. However, I enjoyed seeing them doing things together and being offered by their parents. Before I upload it, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, when the FRIEND KILLS shows you how to be anorexic or bulimic, it can affect one's body." Finally, I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for tears and a good time, so next time it's on TV, kick back with a friend and watch it.
