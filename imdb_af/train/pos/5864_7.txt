I didn't enjoy the pretentious and overstated Apocalypse now. Probably my favorite Vietnam War movie is The Deer Hunter. The Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the lives before the war. This movie is mainly Deer Hunter 2. The writing is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The story has never been developed to the point that the audience can really understand and feel the characters the Deerhunter did. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or engaging as those in the Deerhunter. That's why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the play was outstanding. DeNiro and Harris are truly wonderful actors. They immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anxiety of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in battle. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the blame he has in Bobby, loses his life to save his life. <br /> <br /> I also like the supporting role. Everyone in town is part of the movie. Of course, the town can't do well with Vietnam veterinarians. Like many small towns, it's all about being quiet, humble, and thinking about your business. However, Harris's character cannot be of these things. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some people recover quickly, while others never really recover.
