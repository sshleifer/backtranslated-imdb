I saw this movie today and I have to say it was much better than I expected it to take a few hours before I saw it. Personally, I had some prejudice because of the language, but it totally changed my idea. The movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the performances of the great actor and actress. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to achieve it. It really touched me and if a movie based on a true story, it convinced me. A new school, a psycho-schoolmaster and a young boy who becomes familiar with a new teacher, a little different from the others, and to fight for things, even if they don't seem to work out. It showed how little things can make big changes in many things, and how different situations can sometimes cause. I also think the actor choices went perfectly well. It really felt like you were someone watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened. Before I praise this movie with praise, I have to admit that there were a few things and situations that didn't look and feel realistic. Just like the principal of Frits aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He was really beaten, but the only thing that caused him was a little blood coming out of the nose when compared to the first beat at the start, when Frits had a few stitches. Well, I think every movie has its own flaws ... to say that someday if I get this DVD from the store somewhere, I'm sure I take it with me.
