I noticed that a new hope and the EMPIRE STRIPES are back in the TOP 10, but this one is not even in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation due to Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - The salvation of Han Solo by Jabba: This officer breaks the Han Solo into the debt subplot, which first marks the character in A NEW HOOP. <br /> <br /> The emperor was finally revealed: Well, it may not work, now that the prequels are out, but it was the first time we saw the emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - The Scout Bike Chase: Alright, so it was a special effect moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! <br /> <br /> The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts his Father The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Star (Lando's Moment) <br /> <br /> -The Final Feast With Our Heroes: As I said, this movie gets very crazy because of the Ewoks but I think it's so cool that the whole galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, we heroes have their own private party in the forest with each other. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a wonderful final chapter for our heroes and an appropriate end to the STAR WARS story.
