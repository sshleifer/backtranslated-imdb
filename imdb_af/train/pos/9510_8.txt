In the winter of 1931, presumably 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (like Michael Sullivan Jr.), wonders what his mobster father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) is doing for a life. Young Hoechlin follows Mr Hanks to work one night and sees that he is blowing away some competing gangsters. This leads - in a very roundabout way - to the "Godfather" type Paul Newman (like John Rooney) who hired independent hit Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to find Hoechlin and Hanks who cool their heels in Chicago. Hanks thinks they'll be safe with a family member, which is mysterious if you consider the characters' line of work. <br /> <br /> Looking for unusual things like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a tremendous job for director Sam Mendes; and with the film, he made him the happiest young actor of 2002. But the most striking thing about "Road to Perdition" is the beautiful cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who earned a career receiving an Oscar award for the lets photographer. Mr. Hall's work is truly superlative. It helps to make the overall impression of a measured, faced stagger for both narrative and visuals. The deviant end is suddenly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess). <br /> <br /> ******** Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
