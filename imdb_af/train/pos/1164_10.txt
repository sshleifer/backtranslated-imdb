I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official choice for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best photo. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is warm like the psychotic but complex Amanda. It's not your usual psycho-movie. Very interesting and original slides on the genre. Kind of a deadly appeal to the younger set with some good blues music mixed with Amanda's love, is married to an emerging blues singer who has less time for her husband, as her career is declining. <br /> <br />
