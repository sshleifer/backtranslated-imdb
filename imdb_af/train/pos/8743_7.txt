A good movie with strong performances (especially the two leads). The movie is about two American girls caught with 6 kilos of heroin at an airport in Thailand. They were both jailed and one of them signed a confession. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer trying to stand out. All they have to do is find a Nick Parks that puts the drugs in the pocket of one of the two girls. So far for the story that is not original (it has many similarities to the better return to paradise). <br /> <br /> The play and Newton Thomas Sigel's beautiful photography make this movie worth watching. A 7 out of 10.
