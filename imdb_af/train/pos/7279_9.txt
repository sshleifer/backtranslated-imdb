My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 (I've always loved scary movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is wonderful and the story is original and entertaining. I especially love the screens where the RV is attacking in the desert. The rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget movie. The acting is above average for these kinds of movies and the music is ominous. It is definitely a valued gem. I recommend it to someone who from the late seventies, early eighties like Alice, Sweet Alice, Poor Pretty Eddie, Nightmare, Hospital Massacre and the return of the Aliens, the deadly calf ". Definitely a classic !!
