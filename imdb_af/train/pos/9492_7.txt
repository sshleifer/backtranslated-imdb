This movie was nice, but for the wrong reasons. The co-ordination of the action sequences is laughing and makes the movie a few funny hopping moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson put together an unforgettable scene near the end, where Williamson tells Ginty, "You will be sure to make friends!" I just enjoyed this movie for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the storyline that had to be written in four lines on the back of a napkin, and the rest ad-libbed probably. A movie with over 30 parts just has a credit list for 10 or so. It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the movie, maybe they had some insight into how the final product would look. The one thing this movie is about is that it is very violent, so the tripling of Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty to a movie is worth seeing.
