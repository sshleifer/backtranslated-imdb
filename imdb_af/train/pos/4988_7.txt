Man's castle is located in one of the Jerry buildings on vacant land, and parks called 'Hoovervilles' during these times are named after our unfortunate 31st president trapped by the Great Depression in his administration. The suggestion of this movie is that a man's house is still his castle, even if it is just a hut in a Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a cage and the truth is told this man, even in good times, it wouldn't work that much. But in a part that is very characteristic of Tracy before being thrown as a priest in San Francisco, starting a lot of classic roles, he plays a tough, good, natural cup that Loretta Young possesses. <br /> <br /> One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effect of depression on both women and men. Women had some additional stress on them. If men struggle to find work, women have it twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed and some just joined a square meal to prostitution. Spence takes Loretta Young in who is experiencing that kind of trouble and doesn't demand her in his castle. Pretty soon, though in love, Tracy is not the kind to settle. <br /> <br /> The love shows had a little extra for them because Tracy and Young had a cruel issue during the shooting of the human castle. And both were Catholic and married and in those days it was an unbeatable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith very seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the film is Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who was all the pitfalls. to make her clear and Arthur Hohl, a very horrible creep that also has his eye on Young. Hohl brings the plot of man's castle to its climax through its twilight. <br /> <br /> Man's Castle is grim, watching the Great Depression, not the usual movie-escapist prize for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.
