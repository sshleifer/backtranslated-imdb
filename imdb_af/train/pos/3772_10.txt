Bill and Ted's fake trip is probably the best movie I've ever watched. Although the acting and scenery are poor, however, they care. The story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they emerge are excellent, the ideas are good too. I recommend that someone see this classic. Of course, the best part is when they are dead, I broke for ten minutes and missed the next part of the movie. It's so much better than the first one, which was also good. Possibly the funniest movie of all time !!!!! However, I think the best parts of the movie are when Bill and Ted shout well and play the guitar solo, it was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, release a 3rd movie!
