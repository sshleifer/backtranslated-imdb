I saw this movie when I was little - it was "Glacier Fox". I was totally traumatized by it! It follows a cute little fox family. The start was wonderful and I remember attaching a lot to the little foxes. I also remember my mother wearing me out of the theater while I was in hysteria. I won't tell you what happened, but let's just say it doesn't end well for all the foxes. I was accustomed to Disney kind of movies where the animals didn't really die. Oh man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really little and the truth is being told. Already, I remember, happy for the foxes and then one of them saw death. Rent it if you can, but don't show your kids!
