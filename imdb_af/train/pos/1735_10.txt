Miss. DeCarlo's premier debut has everything the writers can come up with - from the France-Prussian war to the American Civil War, the great American west, San Francisco in its high-ranking, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stage coach and Chinese rubble. Just when you thought the plot could not find any screwdriver, it means. It's a beautiful tongue in the cheek. DeCarlo's character (here called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, it's the role she's dancing) is loosely based on the professional-oriented Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the Pope King and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels . . She escaped to the American West. There is a town in Arizona called Salome, where she danced, based on the historical fact that Lola Montez played the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under her charm are not historically accurate, and I assume the Chinese wise man is with the Scottish accent - but this is one of my favorite all-time camp classrooms and DeCarlo is always beautiful beautiful.
