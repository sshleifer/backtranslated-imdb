Saying a movie is depressed is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch an oppressive film if there is a point and this one definitely has one. This is the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family, as they have been experiencing many years of trouble and much. BUT, I have to warn you that it might just be the most depressing movie to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because farmers' lives in China were difficult to say the least. Be prepared to watch famine, death and disease segments. <br /> <br /> Over the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery, it is the leading role of Paul Muni. Being a very talented man, it's just a real shame that Hollywood is always throwing people of European descent to play Asian leaders during this era. If you pay attention, it's pretty clear that Muni is wrong for the part.
