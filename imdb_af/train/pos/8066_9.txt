One of John Ford's best films 'The Informer' does not contain any grand scenery of the American West. Instead, the intense drama Ford was known for playing on the no less rugged terrain of British character player Victor McLaglen's face. The former prize fighter, who once met with Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an Oscar-winning portrayal of the unlucky IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: in 1922 Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was thrown out of the IRA for not killing an informant in cold blood, becomes an informant himself. For Â£ 20 he betrays a friend to the "Tans" and for the rest of the night he drinks his blood money in rapidly changing spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity and desperate desire for the effects of his actions. <br /> <br /> It's the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo, which is the most impressive performance of the movie. In most movies, a bit of Gypo's kind will be cast as heavy, he will have two or three lines at its best and quickly removed so that the hero and the villain can have their suspension. In 'The Informer' Gypo himself is both hero and villain, while the performance is in his inner turmoil. Each part is explicitly shared with the audience. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel was previously filmed in 1929, RKO Ford provided a very modest budget. The director and his co-workers, especially the film Joseph Joseph Augustus, have this in their favor in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man who was at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar 'The Informer', John Ford also won his first win for best script and best score.
