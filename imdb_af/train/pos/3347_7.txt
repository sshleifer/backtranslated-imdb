Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional town voter - as in when a town needs someone to save itself; He is the one who is brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig comes through as an accident: walking in the village after his early fling, he bumps into a town played by a local western gangster like a puppet. But many townspeople start the day they rented Tollinger, as his way of cleaning the town becomes a lot of tax. (Suddenly High Plains Drifter is less original). <br /> <br /> Man With The Gun starts as an average Western tough old movie but starts to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. Which starts as forgetful and loop-of-the-mill ends dark and character centered. The whole movie is very well shot and the movie is very enjoyable. Mitchum is his usual excellent self, here in Man With The Gun. Not one of his best performances, but Mitchum still has his classic and effective hard-man screen in high gear and he beat the action-packed, meaningful and shocking scenes of the movie right out of the park. Man With The Gun is a beautiful Mitchum western and is easily worth it.
