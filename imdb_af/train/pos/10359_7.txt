Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she has been made fun for many roles with accents, but she nails the emphasis every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as depicted here, was not very nice, and not so smart. But it only makes Streep's work more remarkable. I think she's worth 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the movie, well, there were some interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious story among the general public played a big part in the story. I largely missed it when I first saw the movie a few years ago, but it got loud and clear yesterday. And it looks as if the Australian press is just as perfect with misery-intensive pursuit and survival as their American counterparts. A pretty good movie. A little different. Degree: B
