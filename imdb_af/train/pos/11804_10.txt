Rent the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went and got a used copy and bought it for myself. Now that all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. That must be said though there is a rule made that made the movie so much better. No talk is allowed while the movie is on unless the words Sasquatch are repeated in a chorus. I also loved the credit at the end of the movie. "Thank you for the Jeep, Tom!" Who is Tom, I say thank you, because without your jeep the movie can't be made. In short, a good movie if you're looking to laugh. If you want a good movie, you might be looking for something else, but if you don't laugh at the cost of a man in a monkey, pack yourself a copy.
