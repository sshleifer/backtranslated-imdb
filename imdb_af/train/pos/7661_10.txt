Scanners II: The New Order is as good as David Cronenberg's classic Scanners, Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, so they are an eleven year gap between the two movies. The movie captures the scanners' style, which is a good thing, it won't be scanners without a head explosion, so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that's just gruesome than the first. Scanners II: The New Order has some other imaginative history that is well done. The Scanner II Plot: The New Order is a new approach to the series as it uses the Scanners as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named David Kellum discovers that he is using and decide to get revenge. <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The New Order is a great successor to David Cronenberg's sci-fi classic Scanners and should be seen. See below. 10/10
