It is actually a brand new small movie, made on absolutely no observable budget with the shot at video crisis. It takes a while to warm up. The acting is so bad that it quickly gets a zenzy charm. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or repetitive sounds of some deliveries. The characters all develop a strange charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the man I want to hire to play a surprising psychopath. He wants to enjoy it so much! Communion with the screens of mad-shooter-gore and zombie infections are some truly visually effective shots of the title character, "The Midnight Skater", which buzz around the campus in a black hoodie, and looks for the whole world like a cross between the Grim Reaper and say the silver surfer. These shots make the sometimes ridiculous things the characters of the Skater say seem almost ominous. The soundtrack has some very fun Garage-Punk songs, and the grumpy, sobriety of it goes well with the movie's mood. Thumbs up, I say.
