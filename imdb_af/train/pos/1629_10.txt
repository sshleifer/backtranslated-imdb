This movie is so cheap, it's engaging !!! Featuring Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) who offers the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history. I own 2 copies of this movie on video ... on one, Ralph Macchio was actually caught in the background by Major Vaugn while he was ranting on "Hash". Obviously, they forgot to make this mistake out of the movie, but it will show how funny the movie is, if the actors themselves can't keep their face straight!
