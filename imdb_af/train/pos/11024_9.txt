This movie is just fantastic. It is entertained from start to finish, always on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. According to me, this film is much underestimated by the critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of well-trained mountain rescuer Gabe Walker. Along with him, Michael Rooker makes a good appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen of him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie is at a mountain with a lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
