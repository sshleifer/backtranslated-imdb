"Chuck: The Night Stalker" is a very entertaining television series in which a pushy, sarcastic, forty-something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal battles with supernatural (and sometimes alien) forces. Based on a very popular TV movie with the Kolchak character, this series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it still retains a strong cult today. But will the average contemporary viewer be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the dead? <br /> <br /> It is actually a difficult question to answer fairly. Violations of this series tend to argue that it is formal and hopelessly dated. On the other hand, supporters argue that it is cleverly written, benevolent and sometimes actually clumsy. And I? I have a foot in both camps. I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak recently on DVD, although I can clearly see that the series has major flaws. <br /> <br /> I will only address the issue of Kolchak as "formula" fiction. Now I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas - for example, every single episode of Columbo unfolds in the same pattern. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; In fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy, and actively look, repetitive entertainment. The problem with Kolchak, however, is that the formula is simply too stiff - it is too repetitive, even according to the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder and determines that it was dedicated to some form of monster. He tries to publish a story about the monster, but his editor, Vincenzo, blocks him, always because Kolchak does not have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. And unfortunately Kolchak is also being hampered by the police. So, in the end, Kolchak does some independent research on the monster, figure out how to kill it ... and then kill. Without ceremony, or rewarding, or writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this equally rigorous formulation can get tired, right? I am especially thought of by Vincenzo - if Kolchak is always raving about monsters, and Vincenzo never believes it. Well, why did Vincenzo not fire Kolchak or commit him? That's what any normal boss will do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their screens are largely unbelievable. Although they are also very funny. <br /> <br /> The very best episodes of Kolchak deal with the limitations of this formula, but usually because they contain some kind of unexpected turn. These selection episodes are good enough that I think they are largely immune to typical criticism of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights - an episode that is remarkable to be funny, resourceful, and socially aware. Kolchak's dialogue has an extraordinarily sharp and cynical edge. While carefully following the Kolchak formula, the writing (written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster) is remarkably literate, and it is deep in the monster's background. The devil's platform - a possible inspiration for the Omen films, this episode is ahead of me because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - Kolchak disregarded a satanic contract full of delicacies (and it reveals a lot about the reporter <br /> <br /> Fire trap - this episode seems to have a bad reputation among fans, but I enjoyed it because it has a big red herring and a very creepy, almost unstoppable apparent monster. <br /> <br /> Although I 'chose these three episodes for praise, I want to say that most of the stories are entertaining at least. For my money there are only two complete turkeys in the 20 episode: Primal Scream, running across the monkeys in Chicago, and the Sentry, which contains the stupid-kiss-creature in the history of filmed entertainment (and this assessment come from a lifelong Doctor Who and Godzilla fan!) <br /> <br /> In balance, it's a good series. A little repetitive, a little cheese maybe, but it has elements of greatness. Even during the worse episodes, Darren McGavin's wonderful performance as the biting, world-weary, endless, funny Kolchak really shines. He carried the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, didn't run Sarah Michelle Gellar on Buffy. McGavin was a great character actor, and this series is worth watching for him alone.
