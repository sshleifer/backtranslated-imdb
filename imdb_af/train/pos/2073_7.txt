In 1958, Clarksberg was a well-known speed trap town. Many revenue was generated by the Sheriff's Department of Speed. Those who tried to pass the Sheriff? Well, it gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the Clarksberg curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, in the beginning of the movie, a few servicemen are on leave trying to get back in time, killed after their death, if I remember correctly. Then a stranger drove into town one day. Maybe the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord gaskets. Possibly the ultimate hot rod. A black flamed '34 Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. He is deliberately picked up for speed by the Sheriff. He looked out at the leak of the land. He is the brother of one of the Sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all in favor of the Sheriff. There is only one way to serve justice for the death of his brother and to make things so good, "it will never happen to anyone again": recreate the chase and make the game hot-rod style to death. He goes out to the curve and practices. The Sheriff knows McCord knows. The race starts ... This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who has ever tried to maneuver on a certain road.
