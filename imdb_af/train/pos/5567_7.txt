And I will tell you why: whoever decided to change this movie to make it suitable for television, was very badly advised. Everything related to drugs is cut out and covered !!! How do they do that, you might ask? Well, it doesn't do that well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the dagga that Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke smoke stoning others along their path with no explanation whatsoever!
