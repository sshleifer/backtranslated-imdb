The first time I saw it, I didn't laugh too much. At the time I was only about fifteen years old and thought some of the deeper humor might be too mature for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I saw it a second time a few months ago, and this time it was because Felix's suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened a little. This scene has some of the things Oscar had said, and later Felix seemed unnecessarily cruel later in the movie, and their personality dots were not as amusing as they could have been. If I didn't already know the story, I would worry that some of Oscar's crimes to Felix could push him over the edge. As it was, it didn't make me laugh or smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, a pretty good movie and it has created one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.
