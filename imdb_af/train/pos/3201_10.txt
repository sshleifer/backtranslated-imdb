This is an early movie "Pilot" for the hit Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. It was played on some networks by executives before Showcase decided to sign them for a TV show. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy movies. The movie is that these two little time criminals revolve around wiping out pets for money. If you have a dog next door that barks all night, it's the guys you go! But they are in trouble when they come across a job too big to handle and end up in a shooting. Watch this movie if you want to understand the start of the TV series. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Valued R for curse, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's not too offensive (they don't actually show animals being killed)
