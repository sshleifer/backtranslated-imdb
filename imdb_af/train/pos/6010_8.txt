"Zabriskie Point" (1970): This was especially interesting for me at a personal level, as it happens under identical circumstances with identical peers, in my own life ?? the late 60's / early 70's tea culture movement, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, which are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and dining rooms of his campus, and the other a young woman traveling to Phoenix to see her father and employer and " an "establishment" works. The film is COMPLETE of our Italian directors (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notations of America, and the confused, psychedelic races of that era's self-righteous, "we know it all, we'll change everything for the better" youth. Just who IS the "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Clothes you like and march to sing? Do you fly under the radar, but give advance notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself and discuss the issues of change without the need for group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period piece" - full of snake, uniforms, somewhat surrealistic film moments (it's a movie of the man who gave us the wonderful "Blow Up" of 1966) and the era's artefacts, but it's more. It offers cultural revolution options, and goes through Antonioni (who supports it). The youth is too involved to see what is needed for radical success. As a result, it becomes a powerful, frightening movie that applies to anyone at any time, anywhere.
