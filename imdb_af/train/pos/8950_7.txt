For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jimmy Stewart, it is one of his "smaller" films of later in his career. And while it's not a good movie compared to many of its other pictures, it's not bad and it's a decent time - but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for an inexplicable reason she decides to make a game about poor Jimmy to fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and freestanding lady begins. Novak also fell in love with Stewart - and apparently in the witch's rule book it's a definite NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensitivity to the witches. They are neither the baby sacrifice nor the almighty variety. Most of their magic is fairly limited and useless (like Jack Lemmon with his power to switch off street lights). And, very strange, the witches all seem to be bohemians hanging in hips, where you can see people wearing bears and listening to crappy jazz. In light of what I think of jazz, it really should stink to be a witch in the world of film! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty romantic and slightly comical, but not something I will run out to watch. The play is pretty good, but the script doesn't pay enough to make it an exceptional movie. I almost recorded the movie a 6. It was very close.
