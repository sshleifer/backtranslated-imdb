"The sweet is never so sweet without the acid." This quote was essentially the theme of the movie. Tom Cruise plays a young man who is handed over everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes to full swing in this great movie with a beautiful twist. This movie keeps you in the plot and can't interrupt it to take a bathroom break. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really walks you back and looks at your life and how you live it. You can't really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you've experienced the bad. The theme will really "open" you. <br /> <br /> Only complaints are that the movie is very distorted on points and it is difficult to really understand. I think the end is perfect. I recommend you look at it and see for yourself.
