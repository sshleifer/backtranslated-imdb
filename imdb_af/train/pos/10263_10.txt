"House of Games" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few movies I saw has surprised me on the screen in how clever and unexpected it ends. I only saw it back a few years after reading Roger Ebert's review. It was the best film of 1987. I have my doubts, especially as it is not quite as well known as other films of that year. Boy, was I in a surprise. It was one of the smartest, most well-written movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is quite a piece of work, not just in terms of the plot (which turns and turns and pulls the back out beneath you only when you think you've figured it all out) but also in terms of character development. On my second show, I began to realize that Mamet's script not only succeeds as a clever stress process, but that every plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivation. The climax of the film is especially effective because it is absolutely inevitable. Of course, it comes from what we know about the characters, so it's much more than just an arbitrary twist. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add a lot to the film. I can't play another actor except Mantegna who plays the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal disposition. Their work, plus Mamet's extraordinary script, combines to create one of the best films of the 1980s. It's really a must-see.
