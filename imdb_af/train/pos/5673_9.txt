I think 'Blackadder the Third' is the best of the series. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the episodes are funny, personally I really like the episode with the 'French invasion', but one with superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH' is also very funny, as Rowan continues to play with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: 'Call it again, always call it Scottish play; Blackadder: Oh, So, do you want me to say the Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I did most of his work, but I think he did the Blackadder series very well. /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him because he's already working on a Bean 2 Movie, which will be this year, I can't wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this 3rd Blackadder a 9 out of 10 rating.
