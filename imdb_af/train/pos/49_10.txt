If you get it, it's great. <br /> <br /> If you don't, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean that you are away through a school shooting. There is so much more to this movie that the school sometimes shoots insignificantly. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a film about acceptance, both superficial - of a traumatic event, but also of people who are different for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie about unspeakable pain, and how different people endure it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's anger and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such tangible anxiety that we wonder halfway through the film how the director can draw a happy ending to his hat. Fortunately, the audience is credited for being human; our intelligence is not insulted by a juicy, unrelenting moralist end. Beyond that, I'm trying to keep a clear head over movies that are fiction and everything. Yet I have to admit that I cried like a lost little baby during this movie. There were certain things that were very close to home and opened some old wounds that never cured completely. But it is not necessarily a bad thing.
