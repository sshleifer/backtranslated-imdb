Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St Ives, the film tells the story of a young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during Napoleonic wars. Caught in battle, he is sent to a prison of war camp in the Scottish Highlands, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). In short, he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), makes a friendship with the master, and discovers that his long-lost grandfather, who fled France from the revolution, remains on the road! Spirited performances by all the cast and some unforgettable lines make it an above-average offer.
