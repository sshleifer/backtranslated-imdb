I saw in the movie list guide for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this movie was in the show. In fact, there is an election for the new president of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society that comes so you can imagine how much violence it will take. The battle is between "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for controlling the oldest and most powerful Triad parts of society. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good realistic corruption themes and moments, just about enough action, apart from perhaps when police are involved but followed a successor, so it's a particular crime drama thriller. Very good!
