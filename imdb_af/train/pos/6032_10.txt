Antonioni really showed some "cojones" when he made this movie. He worked for America under a contract of the most cute studio (MGM) and made the most damning portrait of the American society I have ever seen. Having seen LA's first hand, it is the most accurate portrayal of the crowded and impersonal city. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent funeral by the studio is understandable, after such a huge investment and dishonest return. It's sad that people don't see this movie anymore, as Antonioni is proven right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in America's politics. Everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space in the inhospitable (but beautiful) desert and beyond. How I would like to see interest in this movie and get an exuberant DVD edition again. <br /> <br /> I beg people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet. We forgot it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
