I have seen many Disney movies in my lifetime, though none of them correspond in any way to Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally did not cross live action with animation, it was an improvement to dress people as animation characters. The film puts three evacuators from World War II being sent to stay with a quiet and socially uncomfortable woman in the country. I should say that the foundry was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a big desperate lover of love confidence. Endings always surprised me and it was no exception. It wasn't happy or sad, though I didn't know if it was intentional. The dialogue wasn't good, but it was designed to be a kid's movie, that's good. Overall, I'll give the show nine out of ten, the dialogue out of ten, the decisive nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten.
