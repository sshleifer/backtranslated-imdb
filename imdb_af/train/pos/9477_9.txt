It is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. <br /> <br /> Eventually they are spoken, but there is a chance to change anything about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai in 1948 and free of propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is still some weight over history that surrounds the family. History usually weighs in Chinese literature and serious film. <br /> <br /> A young married couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife, Yuwen, live in a one-time family relationship that has been partially destroyed. <br /> <br /> A sharp contrast is Liyan's young sister, who can't really remember the past of the family, but accepts everything in a natural way. Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world, an unexpected visitor comes ... <br /> <br /> I finally felt sad - but definitely a better movie.
