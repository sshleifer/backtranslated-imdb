"Opening Night" released in 1977 tries to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of the theater actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone who will love us in real life. She is self-absorbed, often unpleasant, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Mirtle is also a woman at the brink of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are really or imagined, even though we are secretly admitted early. Of course, Rowlands is well-endowed with love by her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a role in the film. This movie is not without flaws - it's too long and the last part of the movie where Myrtle goes on stage while it looks very drunk is almost cruel. The "improvisation" in some of the dialogue - at least on stage - goes too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, who plays Myrtle's messy producer. Joan Blondell's character has never been fully developed, and I could never find out why she was in the movie, except Myrtle. See this movie alone for Rowlands - she's totally fascinating - and it's hard to take her eyes off her, though sometimes you want.
