As a 40-year-old explorer / photography and longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that has not really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration Carl's character undertook during the series . He always managed to leave himself in one great abandonment, sewer or tunnel to another. Armed with just his trusty headlight (okay, so he has torches in the primary monkey episode tunnel) and his camera he never wore any other gear to protect himself or make exploration easier. <br /> <br /> As much here, I recently purchased the DVD set of the two pilot movies and subsequent TV episodes, and kept all the programs running slowly. And although I remember looking back in the early 70's when they first sent out, it's been over for over 30 years ... so many of them look all over again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining. They just don't do these things like this. Now she is totally devastated with predictable characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter sat down to see the episodes with me and developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). It gives me hope and faith the series will continue to make new generations of fans for the coming year.
