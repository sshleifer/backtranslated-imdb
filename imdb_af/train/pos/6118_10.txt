Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean .... It's funny. Its Violent. and very pleasant. Most people say it's B, but it can't be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good operation. The only strange thing, of course, is the killer snowman. I think this movie was actually one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most movies these days do not have the criteria of a Clive Barker Masterpiece. That is, be original and give the viewer what they don't expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Grade: A +. Ed also recommends the movie Uncle Sam to Jack Frost's fans.
