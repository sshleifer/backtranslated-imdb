I really love this movie. I remember once when I was in 2nd grade, my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film roll. However, this movie may be a bit scary for 2nd-graders like the scene where Bill sees murder of Nancy and Fagin's face on the screen for the first time. One of my family is sick to see this movie because she studied it in music class. If I were a teacher and could upgrade the people who produced this wonderful movie, I would give them an A +.
