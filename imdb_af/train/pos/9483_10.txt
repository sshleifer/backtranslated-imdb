It's a must see for everyone who likes the thriller's special political excitement. One play that stands out is Milgram's experiment. It's shot very perfectly. We rarely get a movie shot and write the way this movie is presented. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a Kennedy like murder and a three-member team has been compiled to investigate the murder. However, one of the members does not agree with the final findings of the committee. As per the terms, the member will investigate a sole proprietorship after the assassination. This investigation is concerned with deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled.
