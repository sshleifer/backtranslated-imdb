The movie "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones drives the viewer to a rescue ride as the main character controls the control of the wheel and puts his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower and actualize what matters most. These truths are clear to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and look out for the credits with them. The simple but attractive settings costumes keep you guessing what you will see next. You can't help but smile and laugh at the denials that take place in this movie. I can't wait for his sophomore effort. It's just a matter of time before Jones hits again. Bravo!
