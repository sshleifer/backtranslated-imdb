Gosha's last major film of the 1960s. A great stylist with a big sense for his films, Gosha, collaborated with Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi fame) to produce this fearless indictment of careless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (the heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists shout to the emperor while killing enemies or "traitors". Katsu plays his character 'simple sensible loyalty to a manipulative politician in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who asks the politician is called a traitor and becomes a murder target. <br /> <br /> One of the best photographed movies ever, many shots are incredible compositions of shape, color and light. The fighting scenes are frequent and very bloody and cruel. The blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosha uses for his images. Beautiful and disturbing. While the personal story is simple to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in Japan would be very helpful, you can easily struggle through the movie. The few drawbacks in the movie are the music track, the length and Katsu's occasional cold cold. He has a drunk scene that is over for a movie, but actually a very accurate portrayal of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Downbeat is just one of the great chambara movies.
