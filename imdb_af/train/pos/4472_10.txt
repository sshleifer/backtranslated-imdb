From the beginning you see that "Ankers Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and very nice. Dean Stockwell is the cutest children's actor I've never seen before. If you like piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did great in an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies.
