A child with ideals that are trying to change things. A boy forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the rights of existence. A boy inspired by Martin Luther King stands up and tells the truth. A family falling apart and fighting through it. A movie you can't hide. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, that until the day you die, you hope, never really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can do nothing, and a boy with regret, balls, a boy who will not accept anything, will not do anything to him, a child with power and a child who acting as a pro, as he has never done anything else, he gives the film to the end, and everyone who wants to see how abuse came back in the 60s.
