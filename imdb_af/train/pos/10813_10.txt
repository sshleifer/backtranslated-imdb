I turned it on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I read now. I would admit that my jaw dropped when the pigs and watermelon references started rolling, but people can't watch this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece. It is actually a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was fairly divorced and the stereotypes for the people concerned were the jokes of their time, exaggerated trends of humor. We see that modern black movies do the same thing, but with the new trends (stereotypes), "ho's" and "hood" and so on. I think if you look back in eighty years, you'll find today's movies will look just as racist. What viewers should appreciate on this movie is the talent of Waters and Sammy Davis Jr. who grew up. He drew his contemporary Shirley temple and looks remarkably similar to what he did as an adult. Everyone involved in this movie had a lot of fun making it. Why doesn't it enjoy what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?
