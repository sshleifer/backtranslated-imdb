Yes, this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dance are wonderful. I understand Frank took Kelly lessons; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time being. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars. I saw it again on A&E TV and also in my old videotapes. Never get tired of this old musical. What happened to Hollywood?
