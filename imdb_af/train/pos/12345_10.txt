Kurosawa weaves a story that has a role-playing characters as diverse as any Shakespeare drama, and the play is true to the story. Each star plays their part as part of the larger story. It touches, funny and intriguing in all parts. Character development is almost perfect, cinematography is vibrant and engaging, and the story captures you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "Samurai freaks" and those obsessed with the late 18th and 19th century dynastic stories of Japan may not sniff this film as Kurosawa's best work. Maybe not its best, but even at its worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is so based on raising the everyday lives of ordinary people at a time of great change, that it is timeless, despite the fact that it is happening in the distant past. <br /> <br /> I would heartily recommend it to any movie buff, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the movie is based.
