A powerful wonderful movie. You are being held in a manslaughter as soon as you involve yourself with the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), has been torn in a life crisis to balance his career with his family. He watches his former college roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attack on America, is no longer in contact with reality. He chooses to engage his thoughts with his favorite music from past and video games. The former housemates restore their friendship and strengthen their former band. Johnson has his friend, Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to bring Charlie out of his grief ... but it is Alan who reaches out to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Author and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also in the film: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Model and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack such as Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but i found him excellent in this role. In some of the scenes I thought out loud ... why was he never approached to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic scene.
