This movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts to ever record with credible answers to some of the questions raised in the New Testament on the "Passion" (suffering and death of Christ) in the recent study. (What motivated Judas if money was not the problem? What can the Sanhedrin bring on a high holy day? Why did Pilate marry?) This is a movie for the serious Christians who think: "The Passion of Christ "will undoubtedly be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and bow characterization. As far as I am concerned, I find the portrait portrayed here - from the willingness of ordinary people to give so much common decency when their own interests are at stake - much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The uninteresting, "just doing my job" looks at the face of the man who drives the first nail in Christ's wrist, is as cold as any moment in the film.) The film does not claim "authenticity", but The institutions and costumes always feel more "right" than many more highly-acclaimed efforts. It is a slow movie, but if you accept its self-imposed boundaries (it is "death" - not life - "of Christ"), ultimately a very rewarding one.
