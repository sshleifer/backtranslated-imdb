This movie shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people who are humiliating and cruel to other people. It shows people's inability to communicate or talk to others. <br /> <br /> In the screening I attended people leaving the middle because they couldn't watch the movie anymore. And rightly so. Because the movie is not easy to watch. It has a very depressing message and there is no moment of grace in the film. It's a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste. You can't speak of terms of enjoyment from this movie. It grabs you in your throat and never lets go and eventually you just feel breathless due to its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie or "don't recommend". You have to make your own thoughts based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that this is not a regular movie and it is not for everyone's taste.
