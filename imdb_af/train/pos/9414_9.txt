Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work, except Star Wars, Alec Guinness has made a wonderful piece of work - especially in the 1940s and 1950s - ranging from dramas to strange comedies. I especially love his comedies because they are so well done and look so natural and real on the screen - far from the usual Hollywood fare. <br /> <br /> It is said, that was the movie that has made my interest in these movies. The plot is so strange and cute that it is very unlikely that the film would be made everywhere - except for Ealing Studios - which had a special love for "small" movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a small scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic substance that is indestructible, though he does not work for the company as a researcher, but for business work! So, he tends to sneak into laboratories (or during the day when no one suspects or at night) and tries to figure out his hand. He is repeatedly caught (as after blowing the lab) and given the boot to one day, he actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of discovery, he sets off a completely unexpected chain of events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful satire that plays pleasure with industry, trade unions, government and people in general.
