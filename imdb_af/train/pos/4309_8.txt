Many of the comments made by people hit me as (sorry) the point is missing. Kasdan wants to offer life, just ordinary life. The conventional structured story, where characters have insights that change their lives, and then fade, record music and the film is over, is absorbed in this much larger canvas. Several characters in this movie have just such relief, and then they continue. Sometimes they can keep their insights, sometimes they can't, and that's the way life really is. In other words, is Kasdan jettison's conventional dramatic structure in favor of exploring the ongoing life? there is no happy ending, just an ultimate end; and everything before it is still going on, still at stake? And if you absolutely insist on a theme, explore the role of the miraculous in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for a start. Add all the random incidents and cross-links that are a life or a number of interconnected lives and you have miracles by the emperor. Kasdan lightly emphasizes this theme, rather than insists, and reinforces it in various ways, most memorably at the device, in the middle of the film, that Mac and his wife lie in bed, each dreaming their own dreams, but also later, in the film, how the dreams have the power to form reality. It's not a movie with an easy or clear message. You should spell it just before you, and put it in your mind for a few days, a month, a few years, and see what it has done there. It is without doubt Kasdan's best film, his most mature, his most human. A great meditation on the life of one of our most gifted writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he cannot work for a number of years, mainly because of studio restrictions around "Dreamcatcher." Hopefully we didn't hear the last of Larry Kasdan. A great movie from a great artist. Keep in mind that art must not completely rationalize to succeed.
