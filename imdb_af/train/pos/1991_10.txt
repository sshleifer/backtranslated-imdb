Yes, so incredible, in 1968 a musician won the Oscar for the best picture - and it was the third musical to win the five-year award. The first was My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! But it's Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two movies are unceasingly wet noodles compared to the remarkably strong Oliver! The acting is wonderful; the songs are great; The story is wonderful and the dance is wonderful. This movie is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the remaining New York gangs, Oliver! presents a depiction of poverty in the 19th century, London, England calling for sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a good actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wales, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters calling for sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
