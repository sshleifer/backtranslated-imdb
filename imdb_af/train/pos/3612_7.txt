Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school senior who discovers that she has a powerful kick and started amateur training at a Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is an attractive young man, barely older than she, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago was instructed to save it for his next match. <br /> <br /> Both are participants in a "gender-blind" athletics program that makes no distinction between men and women, a wrong attempt to ease the athletic field. <br /> <br /> A conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I won't stop it - "Let's see, the president is black." I'm here to make an equal perspective: "Men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases out of 100, it doesn't have to make a difference in physical performance. But in the top one percent - trained athletes whose skills have been honed - men generally have the advantage. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have larger muscle mass and upper torso strength. These differences in bodybuilding make it possible for women to give birth and to cover children and men to catch and kill food for them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection. Without it, there can be no people at all. And that, boys and girls, is why they have men's and women's events at the Olympic Games. I'm talking to you as your anthropologist. It will be ten cents, PayPal preferred. <br /> <br /> That's why I call this sex-blind program wrong. As talented, a boxer like Rodrigues, if she's the game's highlight, will eventually lose to a man. <br /> <br /> This is where the complication in this movie arises. Rodrigues is finally in agreement with her boy, Douglas. Also, no one wants to let go of the other, not to mention the rights of the home, but the pride of both is at stake and pride is both personal and gender-related. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is insulted by what she sees as his protesting attitude. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from the movie. I thought it would be a deterrent to Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" until I discovered it was released earlier. And I've never heard of the director or any of the artists. This kind of darkness usually shoots sick-watched television viewers and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was amazed at how neat it was. The total absence of bados opened to me. So the minimal use of boxing cliches - the torn ropes, the blood, the pruning of the swollen eye, the swollen after-faces, the thick and sweaty spectator, "Shoot him!" the spray of sweat from the milled head, the heroic music that shows the long-awaited apotheosis of the victor. Not one of them - well, almost nothing. The whole plot can be considered formative. Hard child finds exhaust in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling that you're left is that it's probably pretty much what these amateur games are. Unlike what we see on television and in ordinary movies. No bells call, for example, a dancing and acting referee calls "Stop!" A "Box!" Participants wear head tools. The gym is not populated by a crowd of cheering spectators, but only by a handful of people who have a particular interest in the passage. It's a clean movie, despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamics. Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty, glowing under her pockets with her muscular bulk and her eyes, but as soon as you get used to the idea that it is a girl who can hit you on a pulp when she wants, and once you get the female contours of her super segmentals, she is not bad. (A scene in which she stomped her father on the floor, endured it.) It was a bit difficult to understand Douglas's self-control as Rodriguez crawled into bed over him. Director, Karyn Kusama, carefully selected her talent. <br /> <br /> Show what you can do with talent, imagination and some kind of money. There should be more movies like this. Take one of those multi-billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity around a little.
