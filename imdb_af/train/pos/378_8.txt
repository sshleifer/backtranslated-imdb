Nowadays, Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning silver. What is even more worrying is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserve more praise than they were awarded. <br /> <br /> The story is about the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African American woman who was initially dominated by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans a few years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It is told from a definite female perspective, but you don't have to worry about it being a chick. <br /> <br /> The story is an interesting one that sometimes lives with humor, though the central character's struggle is most important. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the end of the movie, but I don't mind, although similar content in a smaller movie will probably make me roll. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were definitely deserved and Danny Glover was inexplicably choked. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a best director nomination for his efforts. Such a failure thinks faith, as Spielberg's direction is up here. I'm not particularly fond of Quincy Jones's score, but it's not below average. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-versed by a master filmmaker working on Pulitzer. Prize winners. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I can about how it can be treated so badly on Oscar night.
