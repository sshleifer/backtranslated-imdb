It could be a 10 if it wasn't for the predictable and hollywood-ish scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not ask the leading one) and the rest of the film is on a very high level. I was personally impressed with Hugh O 'Connor who played Christy Brown as a child. The very first scene I watched was very strong. Wow.
