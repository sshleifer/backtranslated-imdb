This movie has always entertained me. When comparing it to the serial mother, Waters returned to its grottier side. It's not nearly as smooth. <br /> <br /> There's a dark side here. A message on how success and fame changes a person - but more importantly how it changes people around you. <br /> <br /> There isn't a fake moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are somewhat cartoonish ... but I want to believe this is what Mr. Waters are trying to reach. <br /> <br /> Seeing Mr. Waters developed ... This is truly his best job.
