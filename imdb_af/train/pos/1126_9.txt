My interest has been raised as I penetrate and have seen the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought OK, show what it is. I'm so glad I stayed on the canal. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sad, some on top of the scene, but a great time to be. I watch it and it makes me sad for all the fools who are filming the film industry and these beautiful jewels are over. Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did. I even got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It starts slowly but builds the drama and you will be drawn into the story. When I watched this beautiful movie, I wanted to be in more Greek tragedy and pathos.
