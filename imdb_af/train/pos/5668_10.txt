I accidentally stumbled upon this series. After half an episode I was addicted. American Gothic was a dark, strange series with Gary Cole as the mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed with Gary Cole's sinister sheriff and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb could stand up against Sheriff Buck, one of the scary characters ever created for a TV show. I rarely saw a child actor with as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you weren't happy to see Lucas in the American Gothic, see him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and puzzles never explained in the short term.
