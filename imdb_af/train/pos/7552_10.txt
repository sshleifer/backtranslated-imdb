CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the Best Short Film Award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Award" at Japan's Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When kitty Nyaako's soul is stolen by death, she and her brother Nyatta started a bizarre journey to get it back. In the surreal dream image of the other side, they meet many fantastic characters and remarkable, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, beautifully beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and greedy. So it is more an anime for adults and children (they may not understand!). A great trip for those who have the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. A must-see!
