Two weeks ago, I bought the Dark Angel seasons 1 and 2 after getting a few episodes on Channel 5 for a few seasons. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I have enjoyed nothing so much since Firefly (and wonderful show). I will admit that Season 2 is not yet as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec is wonderful. I heard about the plans for season 3, and I must say I can't believe it was canceled - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have been! I also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although it looks very unlikely at the moment). As evidence of my obsession, Max's bar code is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I had, I watched three episodes away from both seasons. It's just too good.
