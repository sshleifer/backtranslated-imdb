The movie was shot at Movie Flats, just off route 395, near Lone Pine, California, north of the road to Whitney Portals. There are still splashes of cement and iron beams plastered over the rocks, where the sets are built. And you will recognize the area of ​​any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I won't save the plot because I'm sure it's covered elsewhere. The film is three athletes - Fairbanks fils, who learned a lot from his father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth, and a professional boxer from South Africa. Their physical skills are all on display. <br /> <br /> Not a moment of this movie should be taken seriously. It's about Thugees, a sect in India, from which our English word "crook".

Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaughlin are in the kicks. <br /> <br /> Sorry to walk around evolution, m when i am an anthropologist and this is an occupational disease. Did I ever tell you about the horse in Vaitongi, Samoa, who slipped on the cement and fell with me in the bath? You have to look at the hooves. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is nice, really. I first got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was so many films. I live in Saratoga, California, where her sister, Olivia DeHavilland, grew up and went to a monastery school. Nice place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this adventurous live, winding chronicle of British Empahh, you should never forgive.
