This show will probably not appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she didn't ask for permission and she apologized. It's a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of purse-steal male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, confused distortion. If you can't appreciate the unfair humor it offers, the performance is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. This brings the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also shows the best talents of the emerging online community, channel101.com. (If you're in this exhibition, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1 this March, it will draw from the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Watch Sarah Silverman's performance. These kinds of things are the future of entertainment.
