This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and the laughs of audience members support me. Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) the laugh is so spontaneous and intense. Easily complicated as last year's mr. A wife. Smith (2005) in the use of parody (espionage in Mr. And Mrs. Smith and sex in my super ex-girlfriend). Director's Ivan Reitman balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and straight ludicrous, is great. The shock and dramatic gravity never break the rule of comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy loses its gripping emotional elements, even if the end is broadcast in advance. In some ways it is so clear that it is good to see how it plays. Just as in real life, sometimes the truth is so clear that one cannot really see it. Easily eight out of the ten star rankings up there with Tootsie (1982). Possibly a nine (depends on how it appears on a second view).
