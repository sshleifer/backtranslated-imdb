Similar to a very primitive episode of the "General Hospital" that was filed in a birthday (and one for difficult cases), this fast moving programmer has a satisfactory emotional impact. Mainly because Eric Linden, as the apostate young man in the main plot, is so tangible a wreck, and with such good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, was sentenced at the beginning of a 20-year jail sentence to make a leader likely to come to him; Miss. Young, as always, does nothing to avoid obedient sympathy, and she is a little too good to be true, but sympathetic and fun to watch naturally. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls in the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome - not quite happy - feels right. Aline MacMahon, one of the cinema's few perfect actresses, "in the appropriate words of film historian David Thomson, generates warmth and authority as chief nurse and Glenda Farrell, as a non-willing new twin of twins, gets crowned" Frankie and Johnny "as a drunk lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets more scope than Warners usually allowed him. It's slim and tailored, and Linden's expectant father panic stays with you for days - this kind of part is often played for the laugh, but he is a terrible young child in trouble and very convincing.
