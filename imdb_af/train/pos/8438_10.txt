HLOTS was an excellent series, that's what NYPD Blue will never be, at HLOTS the plots are really, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie. All the evil points were fixed. It was good to have all the gang back together, even a few deceased. (Don't say how). The storyline was fast, emotional and full of spirit The series had week and week. Murder, Life on the streets, Network drama at its BEST !! 5 stars !!!! Thumb up and everything. Thank you NBC for giving us the last we didn't get!
