Outrage is pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good at the movie and was perfect for the part! It's hard to believe it's a real story, but what can you do? When I looked at it, I thought why they should do all those things. It's not right, but they learned their lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anyway, if you ever see this movie on TV, watch it because it's a good one!
