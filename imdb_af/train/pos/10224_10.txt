... and I mean it. If not literally (I haven't seen every movie ever created!), At least, of course, under one, the many I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The thumb rule with IMDb is this: sometimes movies are highly rated (for example, the piece of Kannes Competition-Crown-Korean Crab called "Oldboy") can really be bad. But rarely is a movie worth watching, actually appreciated under 6. This movie, which is worth watching, is. A shame. <br /> <br /> True, I give it a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. His true rating should be an 8 or a 9. It has some acting errors (especially Belafonte), the writing sometimes wander around. But what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, Czech Jan Kadar, who directs two of the best actors of all time, the beloved, bigger-than-life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska a play / poetic / moral tour the power. A couple made in heaven! It is true that this movie, small mistakes, does not break average audiences, but those who are interested in an excellent (while, again, no more than critical) film by the incomparable director who gave us the store on the main street , look, (the best film ever about the Holocaust) shouldn't miss it, just because a foolish IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> That's not.
