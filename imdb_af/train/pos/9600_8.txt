This movie is a touch on an adventure taken by 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, an irreparable disease that had the age of nineteen his brother's life and is the number one killer of babies in the United States. He and some good friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the aim of adapting his wheelchair to MTV's Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang head west for a journey that all its participants will never forget. For the first time, Darius is getting a boat in a boat, riding a hot air balloon, swimming in the sea and visiting the sights he always wanted to see like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material. They make no money from selling the $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 goes to the disease investigation and $ 3 goes to more copies. The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote from Variety, 'Certain to stir hearts'.
