I thought the movie "I Do They Don't Do" was fantastic. In the past I looked at Rob Estes for "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett at "Melrose Place" and loved them again to see them again in "I don't do them". They have great chemistry together (I think they are married in real life, help it!). In the movie, they are both widows with children and careers, and they fall in love and try to mix both of them busy chaotic families without dropping the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they keep it together, it's what works and raising a family is about. So many people talked about this movie - all good! - And the movie fell in love with us. That would make a good series - up to many ages! - It would be so nice to see a real life on earth, a family program like this that depicts the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "Reality TV" that all the stations overwhelmed us with these days. Someone tells the people of ABC Family they've started a new series here!
