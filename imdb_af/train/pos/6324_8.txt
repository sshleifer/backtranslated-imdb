These guys are all but the usual suspects! They are a lot of similar oddballs you want to see to get away with, but they are so uncomfortable that there is little chance. No one is better than William H Macy to portray the man with a big heart, but on his luck. It's probably his best performance since Fargo. Sam Rockwell played the meat boxer perfectly, and the rest of the gang was also good. Luis Guzman delivered a great comic relief as Cosimo and George Clooney stole every scene. its cameo role. The hoist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The direction was also on the Russo brothers. There were definitely a Coen brothers who feel the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers. They have a long way to go to fit the Coen's, but it's a great start and I'm looking forward to their next celluloid outing. ....... "Yo Mutha is a whore"!
