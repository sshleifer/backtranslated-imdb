Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has an unlawful motive to meet those behind their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while talking on his cellphone and the film followed his attempt to reconcile for his honest unforgivable crime. <br /> <br /> The story line is as subtle as a brick by a green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the end of Titanic was more surprising compared to seven pounds. There is absolutely no doubt, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is going on. <br /> <br /> Usually, I just like Will Smith when it's in full Bad Boys mode. The man is at his best when exercising a gun, driving a Ford GT and "Aw Hell Nah" if he tries to act seriously, it just comes as a pathetic attempt to try an Oscar , what he is so clear is desperate. for. This is probably the main reason why I am not looking forward to the movie, although it is much underestimated here. There are flashes of comedy, but it's subtle. It was the most disadvantaged Will Smith show I've ever seen and that's why he was fantastic and ironic enough for a great award. <br /> <br /> The supporting role play was also great. Rosario Dawson almost killed the movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine as were all the other bitter players. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a whip - but it doesn't throw all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violets to give you no choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. You will be hard pressed to find none of the situations that do not relate to your own life, which actually seem to be. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 8/10. The Will Smith show moves on drama without all the despair of The Pursuit of Happiness and comes from everything better for it.
