Wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one, beyond the uniformly positive reviews I've read. It seems that I could never have imagined this movie, as it is very close to "The Bride with White Hair" for operations and to deal with the fantastic. It runs a fine line between a farce, a comedy, and just a good old-fashion ghost storytelling. There's nothing scary about it, it's not the theme, it's basically a love story about a clumsy man who meets a beautiful ghost who is in trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the man who tries to save the ghost. It also takes place in ancient China, with wild foreign Kung Fu exhibits, and a journey to hell (more or less). Some of the stop action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are the best course. I could watch the whole movie of Chinese movies throughout, because they are highly entertaining, fantastic visuals, and much in the cheek. And I'm looking forward to also watching the first follow up of this movie. Highly recommended.
