I didn't see Insomniac's nightmare for the first time, and I have to say, I really found it good. If you're a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you'll love it. The hole film takes place in his mind. Or do this? The action of everyone else is a bit rushed and shaky and some of the scenes can be cut down, but it eventually ends. The extras on the DVD are just as big as the movie, if not bigger for the Dom fans. It has many overt moments of the set, outings and a good interview with the director. Anyone who has made an independent film will love watching Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else on the very small, separate personal set, trying to blow this little trippy creepy movie. It was quite nice and I'm happy to have it in my collection.
