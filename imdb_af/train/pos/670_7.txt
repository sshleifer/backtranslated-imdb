THE LAST WAVE WILL NEVER HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE MAIN STREAM. It's a slow but fascinating movie for those who are willing to go with it. An Australian property lawyer is being asked to take over the case of five aborigines accused of killing one of them. All forms of portents and omens soon appear, as the man's death involves a stumbling block that is not intended for the white man's court, and the lawyer quickly has problems distinguishing the reality of fantasy. It looks like the end of the world may be at hand, and he and the natives may know it, but no one else does it. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is here at its peak. David Guptil, a well-known face of several other Australian movie and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines that are facing. The last wave is simply not for everyone, except MAGNOLIA (both have strange things falling from the sky). Going out on a slow Saturday night.
