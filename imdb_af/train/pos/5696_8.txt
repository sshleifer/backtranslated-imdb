What do you do with a 14-inch-screened pornstar involved in drugs and murder and then died of Aids? Of course you make a movie. The likely reason it wasn't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of his production. So it is no coincidence that the movie was made just after Nash was sent to jail. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the fast pace. There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it be? There is too much good material here to use dull beads. The throw is good. Kilmer was mediocre in a string of movies, so here was a very good role for him. Bosworth is cute, so it's irrelevant how she behaves (she is solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise very annoying, is pretty good because he carries so many facial hairs that I didn't recognize at first. (I wish they did it in every movie so I didn't have to see his dumb face.) I didn't quite recognize Christina Applegate, and would not have known she was in it, if I didn't see her name the final credits . Kudrow is charming as ever, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (VAT, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only decisive choice that was doubtful was an early near-como by Carrie Fischer and the completely absurd inclusion of 90-year-old Jane Jane Garofalo. You thought I'd also include Paris Hilton, didn't you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a stupid whore. Because the film is about decades, among other things? and about a porn actor ?? She fits in perfectly.
