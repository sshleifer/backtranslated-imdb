From these Pokémon movies (which are the best for me the least): Pokémon The First Movie, Pokémon 4Ever, Pokémon Heroes, Pokémon 200 and Pokémon: Entei and the Unknown, these are probably the ones most relevant to the environment. the most beautiful and the quietest one. Whether it's good points or not, "Pokemon 4Ever," still has a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Besides the three points above, this pokemon film includes good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The time the theme of the film is put in a good way, and Team Rocket (the comic strips / rubbish bats) end up with very good gags and become more main characters than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> The bugs are, as always, the unnecessary violence and action and the bad ones are pretty uninteresting, even more than a few Pokémon movie bad things. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is found by a pokemon hunter in a forest. A young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a big forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious ? Watch the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokémon fans and "American" anime movie lovers, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
