The Indian Summer is a hot, multi-character movie, which will make a fine afternoon movie (with some editing). <br /> <br /> In the past, the film started with a group of kids who set a moose, which perfectly tones the tone before being cut into the present, when a group of "golden age" adults of camp again invited to spend a few weeks vacationing by Lou's camp. The film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in bringing it about its characters in this beautiful environment, and gives them space to develop without worrying about plot developments. To see these people remind, and their relationships with each other, is what the movie is about and why it works so well. It never goes over the top and melodramatic, and always keeps its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie where nostalgia was so well captured, and I found myself in spite of never being one of these camps myself as a child. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic character movie, I recommend.
