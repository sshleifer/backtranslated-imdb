Aardman does it again. In addition to Pixar, Aardman Animation proves time and again how to do animation properly. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it translated well for American audiences. My only problem is that most of the audiences won't get the subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> After being a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew what I was for. when I sat down to see it. The animators did a good job matching matched voices with a perfect contestant. Look at the first episode with the goat, which sounds stoned, and the dogs on the street calling each other immediately. <br /> <br /> Is it for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see the show for a full season. But as I said before, it won't be audible.
