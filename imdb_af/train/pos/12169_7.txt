On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) in the bar, they drink a lot and the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law calls on him to tell his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) arrives in his apartment and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Earlier he found that she had crabs, and later, in preparation for his wedding dinner, he realized that Becky was Karen's cousin. This is the start of a very funny comedy, with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this movie is definitely the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent actresses and very beautiful, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly funny, have good performances. I laughed a lot at the story, but there are a few scenes that are many hilaries. For example, when Paul gets Becky in his bed; when he finds her paint; his imagination in many situations; in the drugstore, trying to buy and get statements about the medicine; Most of the screens of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the departments; or when the police find a suspect to attack Paul. I could call many other scenes, but better off renting the reader or buying this movie and having fun. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
