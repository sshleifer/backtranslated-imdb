What I loved about the screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it remained so true to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, I find the worst thing about film adaptations, that the book is translated in some way or another into translation. You can tell the Stone Angel team, be careful not to let this movie happen. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was an excellent deciding choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar. However, I think Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chosen by Hagar in her younger years has also done an incredible job deserving much praise. I haven't seen Horne's previous work yet, but I'll definitely look for the view of her Stone Angel show. <br /> <br /> I heard the Canadian theater release from The Stone Angel is going to be in spring or summer. 2008. I can't wait to see it again on the big screen!
