This movie is a classic. It's not perfect, definitely. The pacing, while perfect for the stage, is slow in film form as a tortoise with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg was sent wrong to be sweet and too soft. She shows enough acting, skill and craftsmanship to convincingly play the smart, passionate and confident Joan, but unfortunately the director missed the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other play is his dialogue more sharp, or the lines more musical. However, processing this movie requires that you consider it a lawyer. This movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge. This is how this picture should be enjoyed. 10/07.
