For such films as 'Anchors Aweigh', little has been received with so many Academy Award awards in a warm-up for happy hours. Either 1945 was a beloved year for good film, or they still had a shock by Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" that they started something with A on the ballot for the best picture to keep the still picture faithful public . As Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in Singin in the Rain, something had to be wrong with the MGM behind the screen system. Of course, the studio is at its best during this much-believed tour of the great studios and Hollywood itself, useful for those who are on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> But a math package with music The brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra are definitely a pleasant farce, despite the fact that more people are throwing at the previews for the musical, so today's audience will not be slapped with an unnecessary maturity. There were much longer pieces before and since, but in this case all the charms of Kathryn Grayson's scenes could be eliminated. Up to the viewing of `Kiss Me Kate 'it may be necessary for non-opera enthusiasts to watch any of her remotely controlled movies. <br /> <br /> If there was a need to buy women for 1949's 'On the Town', maybe the coast left happy sailors not needing an audition with Jose Iturbi and the piano for a whole heart `Susie 'interpretation. Little is fortunate to get a screen test at the MGM Gold Studios. Then there is less happier to attend. There is no regrets about the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but it does hope the continued non-opera enthusiast hopes that the ultimate pink slip will be handed out to both. <br /> <br /> But for all, the star talents are good form and an above average score that is thrown in with a slight but fun big naval tale reconciled with young ambitious naval boys is good for bursting wars Morality, Anchors "at least does not hold out the wrong MGM movie. The direction holds if the role-play carries the story in beautiful color kinematics. When someone bursts into music or song, the film makes a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> <br /> The natural highlight of the movie is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasy land, climbing into a brilliant dance with Jerry's mouse, a well-deserved masterpiece of Kelly's career and it's great to know that he was thinking of that before Fred Astaire started dancing on walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly a triple taste, rainbow sprinkler, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana-split Sundays, but it is a square solid sugary bottle that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the blame, it is still a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
