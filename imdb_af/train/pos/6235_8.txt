This is one of the best Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorites. Most of the A-R movies have fantastic dance, but juicy novels. It still has the court, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This movie not only has great dance, but nice characters and lots of good songs. The music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a scratch solo by Rogers. She was not only a super dancer, but a very beautiful woman and one with a great figure. She also plays with Fred of course, and they are always a fun couple to watch the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 1950s and watching Ozzie & Harriet on television, it was a real kick the first time I saw it seeing such a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise if Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she had hairstyle that short early 30's, I immediately recognized her voice. Also in this movie is the rapid appearance of Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I still have Ball. I can't find her, but I know she's here. <br /> <br /> Except for a little chewing gum in the first third of the movie, Astaire was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - is also nice. <br /> <br /> It's just a nice, good movie and good one if you want the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
