First, I give my rating for the range overall; ******* 7 out of 10 stars. I took three for the downhill slide that this series suffered after John Amos left. Don't get me wrong, there were difficult episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for a season and returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a very large sit-com (with dramatic overtones) took precedence over CBS. It was a TV first, a show about an African American family who lived in the Chicago projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a devolution of Maude, he again struck the right chord with viewers. <br /> <br /> Not since this show, I saw a situation comedy talking directly about the struggle of inner families. (Well, there was Fox's "South Central" in '94, but was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted like any father had to. his family and his children go down the wrong paths. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful non-sensible mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to parenting. . <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael is a young but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. His character's name is the same as the show's founder Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson on "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and has to deal with the dangers of a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young wise, creaking young man who doesn't take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, with the exception of the Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson story lines. <br /> <br /> After the death of the James Evans character, the performance lost its stability and viewers left. Esther Rolle left for a whole year and didn't want to play a second violin for JJ's clever aleck dino mite! <br /> <br /> She returned the following season after a guarantee was guaranteed that the writer would even get things done. Florida's neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who eventually adopted an abused girl, Penny Gordon (played by a 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's battered mother is played by Totie Fields, Kim Fields' Mother. <br /> <br /> In August 1979 the show came to an end, with everyone leaving the projects for a better life. JJ the artist sold an idea to a comic book company. Michael went to college at campus. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma & soccer-man Keith + Florida have all moved to the same building in uptown Chicago. Not the most realistic ending, but by then it didn't matter.
