That's why I love this site! I saw this movie on British television in the 1980s. Over the years it's been one I wished I knew more, since it stayed with me as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. With barely a few keywords to remember, I found the movie here and lots of information, including being an out-of-the-way Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike the previous commentator, I can't remember this movie being sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between the mother and the daughter is in the mind as a testimony of great power, honor and dignity. You can think of economics, taking into account the concerns of their lives. Maybe it's because I live in Britain, where faded grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money, where villain is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit, deep and profound humor, whose highly fragile and delicately balanced substance gave it dedication and respect. Somehow, I was sorry to see it being discussed as a "cult." Over the years, as it fades into my mind, it shone brightest, above all others as a one-off brilliant and excellent television experience. It was such a deep private expose, it seems odd to think that being a New York musical is so public. But maybe somewhere the girl will be amused by such an outcome. It is she who will have the last laugh. (They made a musical out of her before your Jackie O)
