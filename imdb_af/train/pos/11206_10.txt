I didn't see this movie! At least not at all. I saw some ghostly cuts that left me to see it all. One order remains in my memory to this day. A (very convincing) spacecraft runs around the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash device to photograph the hidden surface beneath it. The moon flashes in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds there it is. Parallel lines, squares, can be. Then the light fades and the short smile of ... which ... gone and it's time the spacecraft returns to Earth. Great. I also saw other tracks, but would like to get the full movie.
