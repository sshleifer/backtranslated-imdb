If you see this movie, note that it is not a normal movie. It has no real story just characters, a bunch of gangster characters that come together in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lie and listen. The movie stands out that's why it's hard to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why the user's comments on this movie are so mixed. <br /> <br /> I like one movie and recommend it to anyone who loves one-liners and things that are different from "normal". You can't really put the finger that is so wonderful. It's just a comic world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie you can see more than once.
