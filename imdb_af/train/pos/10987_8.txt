Trawling through the Sci Fi weekly section of the local Video Rentals store has lost hope of getting good movies I haven't seen before. The rent of Cypher was like a point on a potentially lame one. My son was so attacked with the current B science fiction that he had not bothered yet. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I saw nothing of Cypher when it was released in Australia. It should have been very quiet, or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, that was a very pleasant surprise! It's also not a B-movie. It's not a "hobby" of the epic variety and doesn't try to be - more a silent movie that has to be seen several times because its plot is fully utilized. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerfully presented when used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle of course CGI at first glance, but they get it right at the 2nd appearance, and everything is different, too. In any case, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I'll give nothing about the plot. The plot structure has a Russian pop aspect a bit reminiscent of Basic Instinct (though with a very different content). <br /> <br /> Only I would say that choosing Jeremy Northam was a masterpiece. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this film strikes the ear as a kind of extremely forced New England dialect. This is a typing key. See the final turn of the plot and you'll see why it's such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is just right with her, "she'll kiss me, she'll shoot me." <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies within days - that's one of them.
