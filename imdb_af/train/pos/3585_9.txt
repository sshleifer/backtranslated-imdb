Excellent story about teens, leaders, high school football "stars". How far are you going to protect your friends? Do you kill? How much can you lose if you go to an innocent girl? Can Love Cancel That Chance? Can you defeat narrow-minded small town people? When your friend taps and loses you, will you do everything in your power to pay her or will you be a man and respect her right to choose? Will you rap her and show it if your victory over a "problem" girl? Can you stand by the one who has the only sin is to have your own opinion, to make her own decisions, to choose for yourself? It made me think twice before giving my judgment on who was right and what was wrong, but one is certain - very disturbing film and theme in general. Thumbs up!
