Didn't know about the movie before I looked and I think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure later and more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The environment was interesting, strange but interesting. The storyline has gaps / jumps that I think the audience threw a little. There is no good soundtrack in the background that creates the "romantic" atmosphere. BUT they didn't matter. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was just beautiful. There were some inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with it and here I am, write this review. The subtle love depiction by the two actors was wonderful, and I believe it is at the heart of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; On the contrary, we will not appreciate it. I had to sit for a while and then slowly begin to understand the little things I didn't even catch. I cannot guarantee that everyone likes it, but I hope you will.
