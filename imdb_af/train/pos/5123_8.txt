An unmarried, twenty-something hockey (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in a Texas base tonk. At face value, this is a modern love story ... Texas style. There are gobs of cowboy hats, bakkies, neon beer signs, and references to large belt muscles and rodeos. The music, if not Texas native, is adapted to Texas, courtesy of Mickey Gilley's talents, Johnny Lee, and the Charlie Daniels Band. And that Texas twang ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of Texas five-alarm chili made with Jalapeno peppers. It's enough to let civilized viewers abandon the film in favor of a striking classic, after which Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman may have the lead. "Hamlet" it's not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is generally good. The dialogue, the production design and the costumes are all realistic; the editing is skillful. And both decisive and acting are laudable, if not worthy of Oscar. I wouldn't play Travolta in the role he plays, but he does a good job ... Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson are also good at their support roles. But cinematography was poor. The movie I watched was gritty, and sometimes suffered from a reddish / orange hue, a visual feature I saw in other movies of the same time. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the movie doesn't seem to be a social or political message. But I would argue that when "Urban Cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it has rather prophetic implications. In 1980, the US had all sorts of problems, not the least American hostages held by Iran. In the minds of many people, the US is turned around, pooled. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of his time, presented something that Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. .. toughness. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical movie. The characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth. But they are tough! <br /> <br /> Everything about "Urban Cowboy" is anti-intellectual. As a tool for cultural expression, this 1980 film was one of several that sparked a new difficult era for the US. This began in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that era continues to this day, with a president who probably won't remember his mind, but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression, characteristics that Americans want to relieve as Texans as to five-alarm chili.
