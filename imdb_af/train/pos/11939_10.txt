I've always had this great baseball movie! It has a great role, including two awesome actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and acts from all the film's actors! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits the movie well! Some of the actors who reminded me of the actual baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell character reminded me, Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders commentator, in my opinion, looked like Al Hrabosky's looks today. This is a fantastic movie for non- and baseball fans and I recommend this movie!
