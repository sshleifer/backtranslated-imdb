I really enjoyed this movie. It made a pretty dark story - that of Shakespeare's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a strange, often funny and attractive modern yarn. <br /> <br /> The way the movie maker combines the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth's Scotland under one roof. The opposing worlds come out <br /> <br /> really the plot and comedy of the play, and you must love Harold Perrineau as the choir, a part not in the play, but help jazz up. The end comes out between the little indies I saw for the closure and originality.
