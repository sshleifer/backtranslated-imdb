I had to see this jewel twice to really appreciate it. When a widow's father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, they are torn to believe him and not. As the terrible events unfold of this story, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons and about their fate. With shocking twists and turns, this movie never makes a silence in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most striking performances are that of his older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. It's one of the best games I've seen for a while, and you'll want to see it a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. I give this movie a 9/10.
