"Birth of the Beatles", because it is an American television film released in the fall of 1979, has so far been the best film that tells the story of the four Liverpool boys who revolutionize the music industry and the world. As told by the view of former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the whole movie is excellent, but especially the performance by Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. Who made another TV movie a year earlier in 1978, starring the test of time with Kurt Rusell starring over another musical legend; "ELVIS". The film was directed by an unknown director called "John Carpenter", featuring other successful films such as "Halloween", "Escape From New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said for the director of the "Birth of the Beatles", Mr. Richard Marquand. He also ordered other theater flashes such as Star Wars Return of the Jedi, Eye of the Needle, and Jagged Edge under many. The only other film that tells of the Fab Four I know is Back Beat, which had a scene release in 1994. However, the critics did not care, nor did they have the public because it did not last long. theater life. The birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simplistic film that will give you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggle and hardship they have endured and ending in the point of success when they arrive in NYC and in the Ed Sullivan -show appeared in 1964. I recommend this movie.
