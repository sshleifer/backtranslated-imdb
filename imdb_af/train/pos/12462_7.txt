Noni Hazlehurst's tournament achievement (which earned her an AFI award) is at least equal to her attempt at FRAN at least three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's child, and Michael Caton (best known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting, Hazlehurst is currently hosting lifestyle program BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS, and Caton is the host of property-type programs, including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.). This film confirms the generally convinced belief that Noni is likely to be Australia's top female actor during the early to mid-1980s. Rating: 79/100.
