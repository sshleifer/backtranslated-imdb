When I first watched this movie, it was a copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still own the band, and I confess I watched it more than once from start to finish! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unconsciously amusing! I got some of my friends to see it and we had some good laughs about the terrible writing. The movie is about a few (remember it's like the early 70's, so they're just too hip man!) Who is going on a week-end camping trip in what I believe was supposed to be upstate NY. They have a hilarious dialogue after they have caught and eaten a fish and the girl spends the death of the fish and ate it! The man comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was part of them and he went; "And it's beautiful man!" Heavy man, very heavy! LOL! Anyway, a few Vietnam veterinarians, one of whom is playing the flute, I believe. (Anyway, they are musical fellows!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple become unfriendly, they are terrorized at night. The man ends up in a chicken coop, and watches his girlfriend torn by the two guys. Actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty in it, and when the morning comes, the guys go away and the girl and guy are free to go. Presumably the man has learned a lesson on how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! It never fails me to entertain me! If I could find it on DVD and replaced my old copy, I would actually buy it again, it's classic camp! You must love these things!
