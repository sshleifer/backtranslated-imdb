Successful homemade married businessman Harry Mitchell (a beautiful solid performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulterer with the sweet-hearted Cini (the beautiful Kelly Preston) flake. Harry's extortion of a trio of delicious delicacies - the smart porn theater manager Raimy (a beautifully savvy John Glover), a legendary co-owner Leo (played well by Robert Trebor) and a crazy Bobby Shy ( a terribly intense Clarence Williams III) who tackled his relationship with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the bonnets kill Cini and Harry seems to have done so. This in turn provokes a dangerous battle of white and wills between Harry and the robes. Director John Frankenheimer, adopting a tough script based on Elmore Leonard's brand-new crime-thriller novel, has a steady funny tempo, delivers exciting tension and effectively creates a compelling bad atmosphere. The leaders are all uniformly excellent, with the striking twists of Ann-Margret as Harry's bitterly neglected wife, Barbara, Vanity as a clashing prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. The 'tight'wisty plot keeps the viewers on their toes throughout. The malignant profane dialogue, Jost Vacano's shining cinematography, Gary Chang's moving count, the harsh amoral tone and the exciting conclusion are all just as much on the money. As an added bonus, both Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A very strong and satisfying little number worth checking out.
