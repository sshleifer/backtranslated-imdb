Betty Page was an icon of the oppressed 1950s, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a beautiful job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a good body. Her acting career has gone nowhere, but her body has brought her to the top in a well-known field. Photographer in black and white with color interludes when she comes from the world of exploitation in New York, this made-for-TV movie (HBO) has good production values ​​and a very credible supporting role. The problem is, it's emotionally pretty flat. It is difficult to form an attachment to the character, as Bettie is portrayed as one who is very level and naive. His self-controlled government inquiries give a lot of screen time, which slows down the film to the end. But it is definitely worth looking at the history of time, and seeing the heavy-handed government suppression that was a feature of the fifties. 10/07
