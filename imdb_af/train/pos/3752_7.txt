This film is unusual and bizarre, and it is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I give this card a 7 just because it is so unique and out-of-the-wall, but much of the time it seems to be bizarre, just to be bizarre. If the film managed to integrate its more bizarre moments into a plot of a plot, then it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is that the creators seem to have just gathered some of the shit over the spatulas, then throw a whole lot more shit that sounds like it would come out of the mouth of a spatula. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth checking out, but it's not the best course by any stretch of the creators wild imagination.
