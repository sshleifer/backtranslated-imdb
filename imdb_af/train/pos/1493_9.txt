I thought Mukhsin was wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages I think Yasmin is trying to overcome. And yes, it can be confusing for some of you (especially if you didn't watch 76 and Sepet and / or Gubra). <br /> <br /> I bet you noticed how their characters from the two movies use right? It's really ironic how the characters relate. Like the neighbor, that is Gubra's prostitute. And the chick at the snooker block seems to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I'm absolutely the voice surplus. The rough, but awake, fresh. As they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin sign, there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice saying "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim". (The scene when he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> It captures Malaysia's attitude (and softly, sniffing at how pathetic it is) depicted in character. For example, even the kids can be really sharp tongue (complete with the shrill annoying voice) and just bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how can you be such a busy body and talk about ppl if your own life is not sorted out. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this movie has reached my expectation completely if it is not exceeded. <br /> <br /> It glued me to the screen, I couldn't even take my eyes off it. Not even out in the theater. Ha ha.
