Why didn't the producers give a chance? From all the rubbish on TV, why didn't producers give six degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I'd love to see how it ends. Put one season on video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for his return. I put my recorder around all the shows. Thank God for this. I just found out that the show was canceled and I was broken. I wish I knew it was going to be canceled, why didn't they tell us? I thought the show just developed depth in the characters. The writing was also pretty good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite all the time. I'm so sorry to see it go!
