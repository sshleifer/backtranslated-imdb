It is a very funny movie, easy to watch, which almost entertaines you all the time. The director's work is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. The movie is a typical police winners history like deadly weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of Argentine kind. The twist is that one of them is a psychologist who played Peretti, and with detective Diaz (played by Luque) he must go on his orders while he is also helping him (Diaz is upset because his wife cheated on him). Some of the dialogues are hilarious worldwide: understandable and ridiculous everywhere. It is very good overall, it would earn an 8, but I rated 7 because it gets a bit down the end. On a personal note I must add that it is a "bravo" for Argentine Filmmakers, as the little thing has come recently.
