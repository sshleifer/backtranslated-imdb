Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the film doesn't have to tell a story, it's enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. <br /> <br /> Immediately, the idea within the framework of a most non-linear film is the older man living on the French-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dogs, who is still a lover, but whose heart status is still threatening his life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets him, but when he discovers he needs a heart transplant, he prefers to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and a lost one. repair relationship. With a boy, he formed a Tahitian woman years ago. What Denis does with this outline of a story is to use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, man's interaction with humans vs animals, and so on. Much of the time, the 'movie' doesn't make sense, but it's because we are trying too hard to connect all the spots depicted before us in beautiful pictures. Life is like this: we look, see, observe, integrate, process and make what we want. <br /> <br /> Using this form of movie (much like she did in a strange way 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer finds that the final product is rewarding has a lot to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually engaging movie, but many viewers will find it over a very long discourse on very little. Maybe look again, it will change. Grady Harp
