This film revolves around the Japanese culture as it does the lives of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is created for those over 7 (especially in public), so everything that bends instead of hugging even when you are close friends. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and also in public! Never less Ballroom dance is (quite) very popular. People doing Ballroom dance in Japan are seen a bit like nudists in the west. Many more want to do, but are inhibited by the culture. A lovely family movie, which will enjoy any amateur dancer alone for the dance series. I understand that it is more popular than Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are just like the rest of us - they also like to be cut.
