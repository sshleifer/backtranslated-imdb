A very close and sharp description of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of an 18-year-old specialist, making his first experiences in his gay love to another boy during a holiday with part of his family. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because of its very clear and silent storytelling, with all these "sound-close-ups" and quiet moments full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
