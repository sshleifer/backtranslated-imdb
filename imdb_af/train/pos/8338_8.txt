This movie is so good. The setback in probably the 40's and Meg Ryan's character struggles to be known as 'smart'. Plus, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And everything about it has a magical feeling about it. Every time I see it, I feel happy. It's definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love the music. The violin is wonderful. but besides, I think it's a cute story and everyone should see it.
