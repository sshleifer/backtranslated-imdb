This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was nice, funny and I love what goes on during the holiday season. It was totally in the mood for Christmas shopping and listening to holiday music. When this movie comes to DVD, it will be Christmas holiday in my collection. It will be a movie to watch Thanksgiving every year for the best time of the year. I heard Ben's character was a little crazy, but I think it just adds to the movie and why is so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a love spin. I enjoyed it. No, it is not Titanic and it will not let your heart down with anticipation, but it will bring on a laugh or two. So laugh and enjoy a good time :)
