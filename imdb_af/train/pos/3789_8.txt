Bravo to Czech, they appear once-off powerful film industry from post-communist slumber. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern "hollywood" production minus the garbage that the genre has shown over the past few years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague cityscape, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> The story actually consists of several sub-stories that are often confused and overlapping, an essence is a collage of destinations, fortunes, desires ... It follows a group of urban youth to mid-thirty people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and relaxation to careers and obsessions. And it is hillarious. There is actually a point in the movie where the entire theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience it with modern Hollywood productions? Although the most important cast is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonian star, Labina Mitevska, in the role of an immigrant experiencing the familiar familiarities), Jiri Machacek must portray for his utterly credible portrayal of Jakub, a constantly stoned Bohemian who His brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes, landing him in a variety of funny situations. Conclusion: Don't miss this one! It has a lot to offer.
