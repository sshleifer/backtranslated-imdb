According to John Ford's lyries shot, Abraham Lincoln's fiction biopies, his biggest flaws could be an obsession with the woman and an ability to dance the worst way. Ford's camera has only view of Mr. Reveal Lincoln's early life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities, it becomes in beauty and depth of vision. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film, which could have been a series of beautiful stationary frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. The film sings the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously slick Lincoln to a tea, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film is about two young men, brothers, in trial for a murder that both claimed. In a classic angry mob style, the town decides to get right into their own hands and hit the few of them, to come to honest Abe steps in the dress. He charms them with his humor and tells them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they have pasted him as well as the boy advocate. What follows, appears to be the overview of all court killings, as Abe's witnesses questioned the joy and humor of the judge, jury and town before stumbling upon the missing links. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like many John Ford movies: a tablespoon of Americana, a thin moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm, that you're not sure if you have the recipe, or if Ford did it himself. In spite of the open-minded Hollywood feel of the movie, and excessive patriotic villain referring to Lincoln's future presidency, the movie is totally enjoyable and well-crafted, if you can grab your drama with salt.
