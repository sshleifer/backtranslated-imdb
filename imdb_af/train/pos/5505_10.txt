It's something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup and a few Irish documentaries are right inside. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president that she may use to bring literacy to his people and encourage them to read the constitution is publicly disclosed by the private media as dictator, spiritually unstable, new hitler, and so on. . without the consequences of the government side (such as pushing them through bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they still claim to be suppressed. <br /> <br /> Watch the media watch their own role in the coup on TV after they have overthrown generals (how much more can you get?) by means of rouge. <br /> <br /> See how the people of Venezuela move to the palace, hold the constitution in their hands and reinstall their elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it really happened, against the express wishes of the US. The documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of action, acute and totally embarrassing to the leading supporters of the coup. The good, democratic, freedom-friendly, benevolent US (which can still send large amounts of money to Chavez's political opponents). <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and exciting too. 10 points.
