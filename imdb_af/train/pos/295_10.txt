Bogdonovich's (mostly) onheralded classic is a movie, other than just about any other. A movie that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid foundation in fact because of the use of authentic Manhattan places and 'true' geography, perhaps the best place filming in NYC I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant and the whole ensemble is a group that you want it to really exist so you can spend time with them . One of the few romantic comedies of the past 20 years, which is not a deterrent to anything else, is the highest point of Bogdanovich's fertile post-success career when his best work was actually done ("saint jack", "finally. .. "sounds".
