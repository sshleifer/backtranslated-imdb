This movie was fantastic! It was an excellent version of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat strange, but nothing new to Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was another level of work for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a little boxing, but it was more than the beauty and laziness of the scenery. The music was largely instrumental, but it was perfect for the movie. It was definitely not a movie that the characters needed to brush in a song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
