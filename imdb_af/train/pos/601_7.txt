I was amazed at the low rating this movie of viewers received. I saw it on TV a late night and it hit the spot. Actually, I think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting atmosphere on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks pretty seedy for his role, which pretty much summarizes the unfinished early promise of his career, and everyone plays it straight. I'm definitely recommending it as a rental, although some of the themes that might seem a bit good in 1989 are now a pity, it's a pity, as contemporary edginess is often used as an essential marketing tool. kind of like clamoring just to be noticed.
