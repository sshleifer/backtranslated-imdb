I saw this photo for $ .11 in 1940 and I would like to make a DVD in 2006. The movie was the greatest adventure of the time and, like all epics, is still an entertainment painting (B&W and everything). You get a sense of true bonded friendship in chemistry between the actors and the performances of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli are outstanding. It couldn't be done. I especially liked the end where the colonel tells the end of Kipling's poem about the body of Gunga Din and tells the "You are a better man than I am Gunga Din." They don't make movies of this character today. The only player still living today is Joan Fontaine
