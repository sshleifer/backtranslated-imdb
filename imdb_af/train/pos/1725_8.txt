Play as a kind of precursor to The Great Escape 13 years later, this little British British film plays straight with no excitement and dares to do it well. The first part of the movie is the drafting and subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while they are underway as they try to reach Sweden. The film relies on pure characters with a simple, effective and yes credible dialogue to put it through, and it achieves its goals properly. Not so little tension keeps the film tapping, and as an adventure story, it works perfectly for the timeframe it meets, such a big thumb on the movie that is the first of its kind. <br /> 7/10
