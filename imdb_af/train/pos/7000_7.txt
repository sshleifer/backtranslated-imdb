When I first saw the title, I had already taken away the theme of the film - it was clearly not a reference to British currency, so it had to be Shakespeare and about pound flesh - take them or give them. Will Smith's sense of well-being, so serial killers were out. It can only be about a man they give, so should somehow be debt. I spoiled the whole thing for myself by locating it and knowing the story before I looked, because the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character's backdrop are dropped to relieve the audience slowly about who he is and why he does what he does. <br /> <br /> Debt is a very difficult subject to do simply because it is very uncomfortable and sad. This is not an encouraging point when hoping for a roller coaster ride - you know it will be unpleasant. I won't say the movie glorifies suicide; It also shares the utmost form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It's also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a fiery story of fire that is cleverly kept in mind and in multiple meanings and a deeply reflective nature. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he not only gave his heart to the girl he loved emotionally and metaphorically, but physically gave it to him as the greatest gift he could. Determine to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - which is a second act complication. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very slow, but I am unpredictable if it would be better in a smaller time frame. I do not have the stress and his terrible inner turmoil as much as I could have, but maybe it was just me who had destroyed it beforehand. To put it all, it's a deeply moving and original movie that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards that will inevitably earn it.
