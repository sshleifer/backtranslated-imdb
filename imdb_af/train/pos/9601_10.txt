Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teen (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends taking him on a long journey to see if "Pimp My Ride" will pick his wheelchair. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. It played twice in the course of the festival. This movie is a wonderful story about the human spirit and the spirit of Weem's friends. I don't often say about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel moved to do something about it. Every festival that this film participated won this movie. It's in the Tribeca Film Festival, and it goes to London and Athens, Greece. I won't be surprised if this movie goes all the way to the Academy Awards. It's snowballing out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, go wherever you go, play! Take as many people as possible and go! It's heading to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I expect the Atlanta Exhibition tickets to be sold out quickly, if not already. Please, check out this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
