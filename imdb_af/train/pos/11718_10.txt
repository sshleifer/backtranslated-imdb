Those who love Elivra as I did in her late night movie lady duties will love this movie. She's just really cool. Her car is wonderful and she is a Transylvanian Dolly Parton, she is so innocent and naive. and sexy all the time - plus more than a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are also well done, and the cartoon is great, with Edie McClurg at her usual best - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is hilarious. Any time I have to hug, I think how Elvira crunches the potato chips - <br /> <br /> This movie is one that is watched again and again - just for the pleasure of it. Now I need to find its successor, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it lives on this one ----
