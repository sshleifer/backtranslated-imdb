One must have a lot of laughter not to be in this jewel of a movie (and I also saw hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). The actors, beautiful settings, places and surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the lovely songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was just nice. The human (imperfect) element is also interwoven, to make drama and manage the plot, as well as to allow a sincere resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost stole the performance of the young stars. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves true novels - those that go beyond superficial beauty to true love - as one of the best movies out there, Hindi or otherwise!
