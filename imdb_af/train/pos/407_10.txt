Oh my gosh ... Just give me a moment to breathe. This movie takes you on an incredible ride and does not let you end until the last last battle in your face. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and so on. Legend of Zu is beautifully created, although I do not like a few things, they used many views. I wanted to see the right person, but, oh ... a few little lodges, and I didn't really like that much until I looked at it again. If you understand it more, it kicks A ** completely! I encourage someone who ever wanted to see a real Asian movie to see this movie. I give this movie one of my top ratings. Go see it when it comes from America !!!
