I really enjoyed this movie, but four things really look like: Sam Raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp-handy (?) Man, Alan Arkin's wonderful characterization of the camp owner, and best of all, cinematography. The beautiful golden sounds of the outdoor scene draw me into the movie, like a sunset on the beach, pulling me into my own summer memories. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and mood feel very natural and credible. Some reviewers criticize the lack of a more "in-depth" writing. For me this is exactly the lack of this film. The characters and their problems really look and so I care for what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right.
