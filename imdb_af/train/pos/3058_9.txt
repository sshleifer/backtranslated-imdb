I bought it a year or more for $ 2 (yep, $ 2), left it on the shelf, and now watch DVDs as it gets cold. <br /> <br /> It's a ghost movie. Brilliant performances by everyone involved, especially the 6yo boy (about the only smile you get in this movie). Plot may remind me of my favorite movie ever, Grosse Pointe White, but of course it's gentle. is melancholy. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, a clinical and forensic psychologist, for a while my spine emerged as the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary stuff! Brilliant work everywhere. <br /> <br /> Pete
