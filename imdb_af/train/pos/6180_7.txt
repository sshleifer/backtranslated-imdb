During the opening night of the Vanties, a woman is found dead on the wharf above the stage. As the performance continues, the police are trying to work together on who and why before the final curtain was killed. <br /> <br /> I've always heard it was a great classic comedy riddle, so I was excited to find myself a copy. Unfortunately, no one has told me about the music numbers going on. While the numbers are definitely the kind that Hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they kill the movie, despite attempts to weave action around them. It wouldn't be as bad as the music was half way decent, but it wasn't. There is only one good song. Worse as if the studio knew they had one song, Cocktails for Two, and we had to endure four versions of it: a duet, a great production number, the Vanity final and background as additional music. I don't think Spike Jones and his City Slickers have ever played so much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen who spends great time with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny, his scene as an actor in love with the wardrobe lover. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it if you think you can get through the musical numbers, or you want to scan through them. It's a fun movie of the kind they no longer make.
