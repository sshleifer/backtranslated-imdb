Otto Preminger, who completed a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, reunited his "Laura" lines for this keen, eager detective drama. Dana Andrews once again depicts a policeman, but this time he is hardened, cynical and accused of police brutality by his superior command. "You don't hate hats, you like to defeat them!" Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals as his own father was a scam. He didn't want to be Sandy Dixon's child, so he became a policeman, but his methods are hard and hated. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly hit a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard it killed him. A shaken Dixon does his best to cover it, with the intention of framing a hated villain, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, it blames Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, divisional model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is disgruntled by her husband, but still drawn in his gambling schemes. Paine beat his wife and angered her father, who appeared on his son-in-law's flat, but did not leave Dixon with the body. With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Moving with debt, Mark falls to Morgan and offers money for a lawyer. He decides to accept Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter to the department in case of his death and confesses everything. In the end, he can't live with the knowledge he did, and he read the letter to his superior and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan emphasizes her love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after so many years of television being uncertain. Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, gives the comment and does a good job, but I find his claim that audiences would not have trapped the meaning of the two leaders' casting, since "Laura" made six years earlier is. In this respect, he was wrong because he appeared in The Iron Curtain two years before WTSE and the movie was a box office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney were great together, and Rut Donnelly is a tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner Martha, who burns the flames between the detective and the lady. <br /> <br /> The night city memory gives the movie an air of threat. Gary Merrill is wonderful as the low-life Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("Your dad loved me," he remarked Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are also great. And Tom Tully just gets funny as Morgan's unfair accused pop. <br /> <br /> A viewable movie noir with a fantastic role.
