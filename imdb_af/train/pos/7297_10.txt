I really enjoyed this movie. The play was great like the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for. The only part of this movie I would change was the end. The death of the creature was far too horrible for the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Of course, Jeff Combs played a Messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. There were some particularly frightening scenes that felt that 'end of the world'. I just noticed it after my third show of this classic creature feature. I know many people will not get the references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you will get it.
