Maybe some people might consider it a slow movie. However, it is precisely this "slow combustion" that allows it to influence the viewer deeply. Like that wonderful first scene: first we can hear the voices; then we may see the characters; Eventually, the camera slowly goes back and to the side and we see a different character, a young man just sitting there, apparently not even listening to the conversation or at least not really caring. The fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the film's strategy: so that the character develops and is determined by the environment around him, but without mentioning the points more than is necessary. People come and go, flow in and out of his life. Although most of the movie follows him (and most of the supporting characters are only seen when he is close to him, maintained by his relationship), we are argued to be objective, so subtle is that. director's touch.
