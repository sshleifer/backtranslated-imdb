I didn't hear some good things about this movie and probably saw the low score here at IMDb and so I avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out I would have had a hard time finding something better. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touch movie, actually one of the best I've seen for a while. I was amazed at how I was touched to look at it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or any media. I recommend everyone to watch this movie. Whatever you heard about it.
