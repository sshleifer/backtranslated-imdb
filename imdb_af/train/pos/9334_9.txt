The Sensual Nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy that once killed the Bond girl, Ursula Andress. The man was warm in this movie. She was stacked and built like a * @ #% brick house. Ursula was hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse's outfit completed earlier. <br /> <br /> Me. Andress stars as a nurse hired to care for a rich elderly man. Even one in the house seems to be beating the boots. One night, the nurse decided to take the grandson's temperature and some needed T.L.C. to give. to her old client. The old man goes to his nurse and it hurts the rest of the family. What kind of work did the family hire her to do? Will the giver fall for her caretaker? How can she deal with the octogenic crone and the rest of the family? To find out, you need to get a copy of the NONDS! Italian but poorly baptized in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
