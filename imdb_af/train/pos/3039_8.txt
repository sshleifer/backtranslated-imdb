Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar Production Winner, Patton, follows it with great tribute to another American's General General, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egoism. With MacArthur you never knew where one started and the other went down and too many times they mixed up. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour movie or a TV mini series. It will cover him from his days at border posts with his family until his time at West Point, where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. This will be spoken about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. It will also have to tell of him who was shot at the First World War veterans' Bonus makers in 1932, probably had the final kabosh over any chances that President Herbert Hoover had to be re-elected. In MacArthur's last years, he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. It had to be a topic they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and is being told in flashback. The film begins with MacArthur, who addressed the student body in 1962. Speaking of the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's thoughts go back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months, culminating in his mission from President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a movie won't work at all if it wasn't for the portraits of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. This is the part of the movie that I liked best, MacArthur and his relationships with both of these men. <br /> <br /> FDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic eternal and extremely boring man who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who got his points with unusual subtlety and smartness. Sometimes he likes to plan a little too much, but he was the master politician of the last century. Notice how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential competitor at the same time. <br /> <br /> Truman by Flanders is as people remember him, a bluntly spoken man of the people who did not like MacArthur's haughtiness of the gitgo. . Of course, in the history books, Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was undeniable, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> However, I could write a whole thesis on the Truman-MacArthur relationships. Along the way, it never has to be a crisis. I have always felt that FDR would handle the whole thing in a much better way if he were president at the time. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also largely eloquent and Gregory Peck catches the eloquence in some of the orations that made him so much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Look at the news rules and see if you disagree.
