This movie is great for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. There is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and scenic sets. A photography that looks very expensive (and probably not) completes the look. I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits / loners who come together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s, but this one doesn't. This group of actors portrays truly flawed but extremely sweet characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the bus and the movie theme, I can't help but remember my favorite movie of last year, Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and sometimes got a little annoyed by Til Schweiger's performance. The scene, all the scenes where they ruin their tricks, is very funny. There is a mixture of humor and emotion throughout the film. I love the end. And of course it's about the theme of the wizard. A good wizard makes the audience look where he wants to create an illusion. What exactly happens to a movie director and therefore they call it movie magic.
