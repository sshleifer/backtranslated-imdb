Sly's best out and out action movie. It's a wonderful movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins' direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely interesting in his action films and he certainly sees the role in action scenes. It was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable of the 90s, a definite genre of classics. As a Stallone fan, it's one I look back with good memories. Very nice action and Sly in a prime action man. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all the features that make a good akiton film. The movie looks good and there is good support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
