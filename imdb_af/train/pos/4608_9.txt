Jackie Chan is regarded by many film and martial arts fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to win the silver screen and the police story. His reputation is the likely successor to the late, big Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon broke the so-called benchmark of Lee's greatness in the 70's, then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80's. <br /> <br /> Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of its American efforts - the one film that really characterizes Chan's excellence, and not talking, begins its status as a high kicking, bottling king -f talisman, as well as his film career, was this, Police Story, the first in a series of successful police films set in mainland Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of his efforts. Just like the American Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, the medal and the Tuxedo to name - and frankly many of them turned out to be insignificant compared to the police story. In those movies we saw a less dumbed version of Jackie, whose opportunity was not to make the most of his fighting abilities. Not to mention the battle order was not as good as those in such attempts as Drunken Master, Police Story to mention. <br /> <br /> The stunts in this movie are exceptional and are the best in any action movie. The mall scene is literally one of a kind and should be seen to be believed: the flying screens of glass, Chan, hanging just off his cane outside the bus while a man is wandering through the streets of the town, and Chan successfully uses all kinds of lifeless objects and props as weapons to fight the bad guys. <br /> <br /> As he is known to injure and break every leg in his body and place himself in the shade, Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman by not being on one Don't trust, a proof of his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially because he has the bruises to show for it. He thus proved that he is not a trick spy when it comes to setting up and avoiding various and cleverly searching movements. <br /> <br /> Nothing much to discuss, but what it lacks narrative, it makes its end-to-end action and battle order. Regarding the dialogue, well, it's not a very big aspect of the movie. Therefore, most of Jackie's fans and martial arts films are more in action, unlike the story. <br /> <br /> Contrary to says The Matrix, there are no threads or CGIs, or any kind of computer maker involved. What you see is what you get. And what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic, full of action and pulsating stunts. It's miles better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all its other US efforts. /> <br /> Police story is an excellent movie and one that I definitely recommend to anyone who is a beginner Jackie Chan fan, but who is uncertain which one they should first watch.
