Don't mistake "War Inc". for a sharp-knit satire or a good comedy full of inside jokes for news buffers. It's not. <br /> <br /> It's an old-fashioned screw-ball comedy, with ridiculous accidental plot moves, stock characters (giving depth in fun shows by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a straightforward approach to political content . <br /> <br /> You see, the filmmakers' political points are things that are almost the whole country known to be true. Yes, we understand that the corporations that benefit from the war are corrupt, indifferent pigs, the political leaders in charge of them are even more unclear buffalo, and American imperialism has never looked and touched more than it does now - But none of that is the point. <br /> <br /> Here's all the noise the setting their lampoon - sometimes in brilliant ways - as the backdrop to a stupid skirt, like John Cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) is trying to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him (Tomei) and the young Middle Eastern star who wants to break down her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonistic enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley wasted me in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's all, and it works. It's simple fun, but if you can't see reality, you think the war is going well and everyone involved is doing a good job and there is no corruption and people in the Middle East wish our Western culture will replace them. you may not find it so funny. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it was a light comedy with a political edge.
