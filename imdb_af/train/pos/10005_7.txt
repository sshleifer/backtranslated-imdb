Yes, it's an art ... to successfully make a speedy vibration. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even see it. <br /> <br /> Fine performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the movie may seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the movie. However, the core plot is very encouraging. The movie doesn't hurry up on you and doesn't hold you enough to wonder. The direction is good. Using lights to achieve the desired effects of stress and unexpected is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice to see if you are looking to go back and hear an exciting short story!
