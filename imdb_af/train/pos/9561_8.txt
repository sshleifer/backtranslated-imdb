'Ranma Â½' is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, it's not just a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is busy with Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are good friends and have been trained for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most violent. Sister of the Tendo's: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the means and likes to win money, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane are fighting all the time, especially since both are very bad. mood, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when he splashes with cold water, and his father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations begin. They also discovered the reason for the transformation: while Ranma and his father fought, they fell into a cursed river. But not only did they have this kind of fate. <br /> If you watched "" Ranma 1/2 "and would like, I would give you" Inuyasha "and" Maison Ikkoku ", two recommend other good creations of Rumiko's hands.
