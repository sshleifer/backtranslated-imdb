Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world, to get a fallen star within a few times, to find the star, alive, young and beautiful. Many stars, many imaginative and cinematic fairy tales. . A kingdom that the king is about to die said King is releasing a competition in his various sons to see who can get a ruby ​​first to be king, while a trio of witches wants have to cut and use the star to keep them young. These three plot wires coincide throughout the picture with good acting, brilliant special effects, and a solid sentiment and humor. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun performances by Claire Danes as the star (I could see her for some time) after Michelle Pfeiffer (I could see her even more magical powers) and the horrible witch playing Robert Deniro to play a Nancy-Son airpirate to perfection. Tristan chairman Charlie Cox is good and credible and we are getting a lot of good work from a group of guys who stand out for the boys who are constantly and consistently trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett play their roles well in both life and death (also loved this whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer dad and watches for the funny man, Ricky Gervais, who left me in his short movie just over anything in his short five minutes. But the real power of the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the writing is from his creative and fruitful thoughts. Stardust creates his own mythology and his own world and it works.
