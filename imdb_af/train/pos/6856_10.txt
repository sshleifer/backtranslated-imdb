This is an exciting, exciting masterpiece by Brian De Palma with incredible performances everywhere! It's extremely tense, and often scary, and the score is fantastic, and all the characters were great. Yes, it makes a lot of psycho, but it is still a brilliant horror / thriller, with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable final! This is undoubtedly one of the best horror / thrillers I've ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever, plus Michael Caine is simply incredible! The end is excellent, and the hospital scene near the end is absolutely scary, plus the end turns shocked hell out of me! It never crept me in, and the stem order is absolutely brilliant, plus Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon have great chemistry together! It's an exciting, exciting masterpiece by Brian De Palma, with incredible performances everywhere! The direction is incredible! Brian De Palma does an amazing job here, with amazing camera work, incredible angles, fantastic use of colors, wonderful zoom in's and zoom out's great POV shots and keeps the movie at a very fast pace! There is some blood. We get bloody stabbings, knifing's, bloody gunshot wounds and 2 bloody gaps. The act is wonderful! Michael Caine is AMAZING here, he is wonderful in acting department, creepy, is very nice, was mysterious and really just did a great job. I loved him! (Caine Rules!). Angie Dickinson gives an unforgettable performance here, and was pretty pretty, and had good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is fantastic, and is fantastic here, she is very much like the hooker, has excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon, and made a great show! Keith Gordon is very good like the kid, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen, and was very nice! Dennis Franz is good as the detective. Overall, it is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made, and I say drop you out and see it right away! ***** out of 5
