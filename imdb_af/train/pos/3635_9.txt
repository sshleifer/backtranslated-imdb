This is a great Disney movie. This is the story of an outdated high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who once headed for the big leagues as a pitcher, but ended a career. But through a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) gets a look at a big league team and even makes the grid. It's a good family movie. It's inspiring, but it doesn't waste too much. It's fun and entertaining. as well as kids.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure the filmmakers have the freedom to tell the story. Quality is sensational as the title character, very convincing. If you can search the whole family for a movie, look no further.9 / 10
