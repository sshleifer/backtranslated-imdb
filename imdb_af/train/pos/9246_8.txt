One of the great mysteries of life, which has suffered daily, is why good girls are so often more interested in thorns and heels than in the guys. <br /> <br /> Worse when old guys even want to get married These girls, the girls still prefer the jerks and heels, even after the jerks and heels showed their disdain, they showed that they were only interested in the girls. use. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is the good guy who stays nice after lying and cheating and even after she's completely lost the girl. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is the push, and he is perfect in the role, rather a sad note to his fans. </ <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow comes across as a slimmer Mae West, which even sounds like La West in some of her cynical throw away lines. <br /> <br /> Something mysterious is that so many of the other characters, meant to be bad guys. I mean, they're locked up, so they have to be. These are so nice people, of course. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many nice people here, people who, to a lesser extent, film or story, will be quicker and backward, but go out here to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So, maybe the story is clicked, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be happy to watch. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors don't get credit. Again we can say a fiery "Thank You" to IMDb.com.
