Pleasant story of the community of Pimlico in London, which explodes into an unexploded WW2 bomb, finds a Royal Charter stating that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy many of us have about making our own rules and doesn't have to listen to them. There are some very nice moments in the movie, such as when people from stock and other London people walked on the other. side of the barricade starts giving food and other things to them. <br /> <br /> Although you always knew that Pimlico would once again become part of the United Kingdom, the people of PImlico and consequently the viewer will not mind. When that happens, it is a happy feeling. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to think that these low budget films from a small studio in London are still so popular over fifty years later. The producers must get something right.
