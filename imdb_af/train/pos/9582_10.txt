Having grown up in the streets of Detroit, MI, and having friends who traveled to New York balls, I became a member of the household member. I joined the House of Theieves. We changed the same rules as most homes, but we were professional crooks who would promote credit card fraud and commit to the fabulous jewelery and clothing we wanted. I even learned how to make checks and driver licenses and pay them in more than seventeen states until a jealous queen called the Secret Service to me and went to federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I recommend you see it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the homes here in Detroit and the criminal activity we listened to. My book, Identity Schemes is available at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, it's much better than Paris burning because it's a 2005 make.
