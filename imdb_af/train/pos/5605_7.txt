This peculiarity of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his worries lie when he made it. Polanski himself plays a rogue man renting a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He is obsessed by discovering what led her through to the point that he falls asleep and re-invents events as they may have unfolded. The film is disturbing at one point and it has the atmosphere of the terrible fear that Polanski excel, but it comes off too much as a rehash of Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion. Two other better Polanski movies dealing with the ominous songs but in the cheerful flats. <br /> <br /> But if that is for the worry .... unless I read too much into the movie, I believe that it was Polanksi's response to the feelings of persecution he felt at being a called sexual pervert and disregarded from America. Not making a sentence about him or herself, but it's hard to deny the evidence in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
