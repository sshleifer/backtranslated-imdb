Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel (I read the book first and decide to watch the movie). First, the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and I love the movie. Judd Crandall (playing Fred Gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also some corny lines thrown in there (Idk if they were meant to be), but they will really relieve the mood and give a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect place to film this movie, making it the whole movie. Not only will you like it, but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan !!
