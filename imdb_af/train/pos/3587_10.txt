I really like this movie ... when I started watching it, I thought I was going to be bored soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a good movie and had seen it a few times. The characters are credible and I have to say I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (Beverly Hills 90210 is the first time). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of her, but I agree with another comment made earlier that the end is so disappointing. I would have loved to turn out a little differently! Remember, good gripping story.
