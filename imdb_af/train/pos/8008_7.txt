As far as I know, this show is never repeated after British television after its original run in the late 60's / early 70's, and most episodes are now unfortunately "supposedly missing". <br /> <br /> However, Series 6 of 1971 still exists as a whole, and I recently got the chance to see it all, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After I left school, Freewheelers were essential to me and many. from my contemporaries back in the halcyon days of the spotted pants, Slade and Chicory Tip. And look at it again and bring a nostalgic lump to the throat. <br /> <br /> Remember the bad / hammy acting, the ceaselessly amusing battle scenes, plotting holes wide enough to drive a big ocean boat and the "terrible, terrible" RADA accent of the main players. <br /> <br /> No - forget everything. Because Freewheelers are returning to a passing (daring to tell the "golden" age of children's TV drama, when the performances were just about rip-roaring fun and they didn't take them so seriously. Before they become obsessive with all the anxious "hoax" that today's writers are raging their young protagonists, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STIs, etc. <br /> <br /> No doubt this "for a modern audience" in these days of all-encompassing political correctness, the boss figure would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other would a white boy be confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all-action go-getter with an IQ of the scales, who will forever be the scrap boys and make them look foolish - in other words' one million miles removed from Wendy Padbury's deferential, single-spray top. <br /> <br /> This is a show that is much of a time. But is this a bad thing? I think this for one.
