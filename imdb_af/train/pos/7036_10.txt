One of the best political satires I've seen so far, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well placed and a very good unexpected turn at the end. The action scenes are well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a big inch. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East and as such it can get bad reviews from people who do not have the same political views or those who are just politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drunk humor. Indeed, in those places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic.
