This is my first comment! It's a fantastic movie! I was lucky enough, one night on TV. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but after that I understood what a wonderful product. <br /> <br /> I suggested to some friends to watch the movie, just to say it was a bad thing B movie. How wrong. Superficial criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a genius product! The well-known director has done an excellent job here and it is a pity to say he's been out of the game all the time.
