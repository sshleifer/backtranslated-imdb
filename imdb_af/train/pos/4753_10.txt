In a series of brilliant episodes, this one is considered my favorite. This is not the most profound episode, there is no great meaning or message. But it's great fun, and there are some good performances. <br /> <br /> But what really stands out for me is that it ends the * single * Twilight Zone episode with a * double * snapper. The Zone is rightly known to offer a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time you get a surprise and think it is, but it seems that * another surprise awaits. I like so much that it's probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is a deeper, more message-oriented one).
