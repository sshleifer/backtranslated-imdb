This movie contains personalities that play so well their parts, I like the finale, when nobody knows what to do about their lives, but it is quite good if you see and realize that the priest is right, for two, So what are the other people doing there? The movie embraces you to a new life, to experiences, to dream with the other person and to reach those dreams. Also show life itself, hard as it is. But give you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. The movie that did it worked well for me. I bought the movie on the road;) Be careful.
