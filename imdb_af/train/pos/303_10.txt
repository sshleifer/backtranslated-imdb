Since the day I saw this movie when it came out in 1981, it was one of my top 3 favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below and I'm just excited that it finally comes out on DVD on 17/17/06 - the movie's 25th anniversary. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this movie explains his appeal - "Thanks to the people of Manhattan on whose island it was filmed." A lovely and witty romantic comedy, it's a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a resident) who can identify every place (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy , Chez Brigitte, and city borders that were a country & western club). One gets the impression that the whole ensemble throw has clicked as well on the screen as it does, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than KATS. Not just an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last distinctive appearance (she had a comedy to this movie) and her inner beauty soap off the screen. Buy it, make a big bowl of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love.
