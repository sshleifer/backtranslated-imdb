This movie is great. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by Gackt and Hyde's performance after I grew up in the American world of actors who can't sing and singers who can't perform. <br /> <br /> In this movie comes a young Sho (Gackt) about a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers from how he is forced to live others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie but not juicy. The plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire movie. The storyline was thick with twists and turns and very staggering. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I would say the movie was, despite the lack of a happy - albeit peaceful end - would be more languages. I had the unsubscribed version (I was fortunate to understand all of this, save some of the Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with captions. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was just fantastic.
