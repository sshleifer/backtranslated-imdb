Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western ear as the Real McCoy, exciting, entertaining, spectacular; in no way obsolete. <br /> <br /> As a true fan of TV's DEADWOOD, I'll tell you that Gary Cooper's actions as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are much more targeted. /> <br /> We no longer have a giant in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of decades of classic 1936-1945 decades that saw ten years of continuous commercial life: released, reissued, reissued. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox. None of today's movies will be searched in 7 months and not yet 70 years.
