As a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not big, but it's something else. The film involves a battle with a mystical (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the world and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in everyday life, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can move between "dimensions" and do so to find a companion guarding a fortress. However, the guard is blinded. His eyes are devastated wells. So the wizard strikes his hands over the others' eyes, and hey, presto! His eyes were restored! This kind of healing seems to work only with eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" create some animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one wins. <br /> <br /> However, the picture is not bad at all, though much like a cartoon. Dr. Mordred's more "human adventures are good, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen much worse.
