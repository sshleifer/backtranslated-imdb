The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a Cuban citizen for the past five years, disappears from the Earth, announcing that Fidel Castro is likely to be dead. Cuba to move to Bolivia to preserve a supposed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara undertakes to overthrow the corrupt bourgeois government there. Again Steven Soderberg picks up where 'Che: Part One' leaves (only better this time). The pacing is more on target, the work of acting is ever so good (including a turn by a sickly Benecio Del Toro, as well as Che Guevara). Possibly to say this, it's probably best if you see both movies, to get the true story of Guevara and what kind of a man he was (I have the rare open window to see both movies on one screen - --- Talk about a long distance!). As with 'Che-Part 1: The Argentine', this movie has no MPAA rating but contains enough salty language and violence to make it an 'R' easy.
