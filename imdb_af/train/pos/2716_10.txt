Everything I remembered was excellent ... Good role with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before he became known to American audiences) ... Excellent scripts like just the English can do. - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type of mysteries, but with a Jules Verne twist. Similar to MacGyver, it would have been in England 80 years ago ... right at the start of the 20th-century scientific / technological revolution. <br /> <br /> I often wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver only broadcast 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I have another episode on a very backward band.
