This movie was very funny, I couldn't stop smiling when I saw it and watched it twice in two days! The film is uniquely unique in humor and visual arts, both great and in the same way as Natali's other (more serious) movie jewels Cube and Cypher. I have become a great Vincenzo Natali fan since he watched Cypher and everything he made is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very nice about this movie is the music and 'loser' characters Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), actors I both love. Also cool are the X-Box Dead or Alive battles (you even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good, good movie about friendship. You have to see it!
