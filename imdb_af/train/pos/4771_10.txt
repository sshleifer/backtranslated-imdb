The highlight of two brilliant professions. David Lynch, better known for less accessible materials, crafted a delicate and beautiful story about the most unlikely prospect. A man travels to see his estranged brother. With no other way of transport, she travels on a lawnmower in six weeks. Richard Farnsworth, in his last film, delivers an amazingly layered and nuanced performance. Already beautiful in his surprise of little things, Straight Story is a classic theater experience that should not be missed. Sissy Spacek is striking as Farnsworth's daughter, a disabled middle-aged woman who lives with the loss of her children.
