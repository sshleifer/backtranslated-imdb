I picked it a ten, just because I find it so impressive that a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera. It's not epic, but it is very encouraging and I was never bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad movies that are thrown out, then this director gives the same amount of money and sees what happens. I know I'll be at the local theater for her first major release. Damn good work, and worth the money. What a script! It may be a low budget, but it beats hell out of half the big photos I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Serious kudos for her, can't wait to see more.
