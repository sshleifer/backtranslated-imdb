There are so many Hollywood movies made that are not just torture to watch, but also do not affect anyone's life. Admittedly, movies don't always have to have deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers out there who care about telling stories. I won't give this brilliant movie the point of departure, but the script is surely one of the more complex and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm also a 32-year-old movie recorder! Bug is top ten on my favorites list, which includes: At the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard, and Black Narcissus, to name but a few. This "moving" movie should also become one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
