It is a wonderfully written and well-activated psychological drama. It's not really a horror movie, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Wrestle will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this movie was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the attempt to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble of New Age revisionism. Rather than running an agenda, the filmmakers just told the story, told it well and made the viewer think about it. The sparse dream bushes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and incredibly effective. <br /> <br /> A good example of how to make a good movie on a small budget, without big studios, star actors, big name directors (it was much better than many of Hitchcock's movies ), special effects or "smart" plot twists.
