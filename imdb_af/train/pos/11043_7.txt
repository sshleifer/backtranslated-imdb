Malefique has pretty much the viewer from start to finish with his edgy atmosphere. Almost the whole movie is in a prison cell that revolves around 4 characters, of which the transvestite is Marcus and his little delayed boy from the strangest. Soon, the prisoners find a diary of a previous resident behind a brick dealing with his obsession with occult and black magical themes leading to his escape from the cell. From here on, everything is about the dissolution of the secret of the book and its game of fleeing from prison. This leads to accidents on the way out of the cell in the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think the story is pretty poor and the final twist is nice, but for me the points are completely detached. Anyway, I was excited to the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast. Death is raw and ominous ... it does not take your backbone, and the occult themes are also well done and remind me of the hellema in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint. Sometimes you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger ... when the delayed boy loses his fingers and sleeps on Marcus' breasts, does it look normal, how strange can the gates of freedom glow? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cold viewer in a completely different way to most of the genre shockers. I just wish the story resulted in a more consistent final. Various elements such as the visitor with the camera, the other prisoners obsessed with books and the toy doll showing vague to the end do not fit into the story. Anyway, I will keep my eyes open to other films by director Valette, although it is a turn off to see that he is doing a Hollywood remake of a missed call "that has been worn in the Miike version and useless was.
