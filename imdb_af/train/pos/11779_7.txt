After reading Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but it's all informative. To read the other comments, it is reassuring to know that the "cultural warriors" are hard at work, as "attacks" on "Western civilization" take place under each garment. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little preachy? Sure. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase "guns, germs and steel" at every opportunity during the series. We'll get it, after about the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series)? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is especially amusing and condense a very long, complicated history to 'smallpox, swords and horses', which packed the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - though these things have contributed to the reasons for the Spaniard's success against established cultures (but not completely defined). <br /> <br /> Is he in any way preaching against * Western civilization? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that happiness has played a big role in determining which cultures have progressed faster, * not that happiness is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your money's own sense of superiority, then this series isn't for you. But if you are interested in all the factors other than influencing how societies succeed or fail, this series offers a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
