"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that goes to great lengths to recreate the classic H. G. Wells classic book. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. And those who watched my movie appreciate the fact that it's not the standard, predictable Hollywood prize that comes out every year, eg. the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise who had just the slightest resemblance to the book. Of course, everyone is looking for different things in a movie. Those who consider themselves "critics" just look to criticize everything they can. Others give a movie on more important bases, such as being entertained. That's why most people never agree with the critics. We made the effort of Mr. Hines to be faithful to H.G. Wells' classic novel, and we found it very entertaining. It made it easy to ignore what critics regard as its shortcomings.
