This movie is a lot better than the asylum version mainly its war of the world. The tripods look pretty cool, but they walk and death could have been better. The action scenes were really cool. Walk ... walk ... walk ... walk !!! Oh, my God, stop running, or I'll kill myself. The thunderous children's scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship had hit a set of boots. Good movie I recommend it to people who have read the book. The music is wonderful and the directors cut looks pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Good soundtrack 99% to the book Cool violence States and handling machines are cool to look at <br /> <br /> disadvantages. some bad acting cheesy looking for London
