<br /> <br /> I am having a problem with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a MYSTERY film, not a supernatural! It's not the only movie to have a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but seems to be a lot of laziness. <br /> <br /> Other films appearing are Edgar Wallace's "Before Dawn" and the (more famous) "Mark of the Vampire". <br /> <br /> The movie does a wonderful job of creating a very "ghostly atmosphere", similar to DRACULA, when Renfield meets the spade on the stairs of his castle, or in the Market of the Vampire, when the two people look through the windows of the castle ruins and see a "body" playing an organ, while Luna descends with wings! Very surreal! <br /> <br /> If you keep this (often silence) atmospheric touch, this movie is a MUST! <br /> <br /> Norm Bird
