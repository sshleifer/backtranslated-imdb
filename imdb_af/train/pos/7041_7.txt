WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergei Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Vote: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> A Hit-and-miss-21st Century "STRONGLY" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? Who wrote the writing with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser? stars as an unlucky hit, called Brand Hauser, which was burnt out, but decided to follow on one final mission through a Middle Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not THAT Omar Sharif, but you get the tone of this misfire for the sake of a laugh), appointed by former Vice President of the United States (Aykroyd, Cusack's old Grosse Pointe White cohort, who does a common Dick Cheney maneuver here), in which Brand become the act under the guise of a Trade Show producer in Mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the American private corporation Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> As he is informed, Brand becomes a moment of clarity as he comes across fearless journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tamerlane sponsors the unlikely union of Eastern European teenage sensation Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent duff who creates her own familiar personality with tongue-through-cheek) and the idiot boy of the country's leader . <br /> <br /> What follows is a brave attempt to make a black comedy of the 21st century a "DR. STRANGELOVE", but for all intense and purposes, unfortunately there is more to miss than hits in this broad attempt to laugh between political message (an unfair war While Cusack riffs are being released on his Martin Blanket of the aforementioned "Pointe", he adds some nice touches of his man in black (he shakes Tabasco -sous to take the edge off), catch up with the rest of the players (except sister Joan who is a riot as the high-end aide-de-camp for Hauser and has one of the movie's funniest laughing lines: "My mass communication skills have finally been paid off") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, Cusack visited the Iraq war in the 180 degree different "Grace Is Gone" and here he left his political views on his Although the film's pace and rhythms are generally over, it is not much due to the honor The filmmaker Joshua Seftel made his legal debut here, except perhaps the well-choreographic battle Hauser is involved with Babyyeah's idiot fiancÃ©. /> <br /> A good attempt yet another wrong failure; maybe next time Cusack won't try so hard and let the fool of war speak for himself instead of the heavy upliftment by himself.
