One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies I liked. This was the stage when Govinda was strong with Dhawan. The songs were wonderful and quite like we call it 'masti' type. An evergreen entertainer with the multiple Anupam Kher rope. The story line has many hilarious twists and turns as is known for David Dhawan's pot boilers. With a timely appearance by Mrs. Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a total riot at the end. It was wonderful to see Amit with such power and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I will see it every day. I give it an easy 8 out of 10 just because it is pure Bollywood.
