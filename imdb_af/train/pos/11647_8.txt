I can give you four reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers in the current Mexican theater. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories related to a big scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good role. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comical mood over the authority that extortion practices against regular people and still expects be appreciated by his efforts. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece with a story of Italian neo-realism with a "Peter and the Wolf" -like anecdotes. <br /> <br /> In the third story, one that even looks independent of this series, even in the context, tells Carlos Carrera the story that a man is in the wrong place in the wrong moment. But after the recent line battle at Tlahuac and the tradition in this terrible state of Mexico, this story can no longer be updated. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor in the "grand finale" in which he compiles most of the characters from the previous rows into one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed . Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme again on the scene of one of his previous films "Todo el poder". And by the way, we give the scene the movie steals with Anna Ciochetti who makes a short striptease. <br /> <br /> After the movie has ended, you get a bittersweet feeling over a good movie (and maybe enjoy it) with a very painful subject. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own shame and that is the best example. This film is a testimony to how Mexicans lived (and perhaps accepted) in the middle of a crime state, between two fires: the criminals and the so-called authorities full of corruption. Even this movie is a wishful thought because almost all the good people are a victim of crime and they do not get this unpleasantness. If you had an assault without a scratch, then you're happy. Meanwhile, the chance of seeing this movie is not strongly recommended. <br /> <br /> And this is a beautiful life in Mexico ...
