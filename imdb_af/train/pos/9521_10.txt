I think this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons why, but these are some of them. 1) The good that Tom and Tyler did. 2) Brilliant machine gun scene that was a bit brilliant. 3) I thought the end was a good turn because I never expected to end all the credit to Sam Mendes.as as well as this 3 points the movie form of the movie is good too. I am a film student at the college and we have studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I have seen in many years. I would like to thank all the people involved in making this film. Finally, I want to say the best scene in the movie is the machine gun scene where John Rooney is killed. It's just sheer shine to shoot the scene in silence until John Rooney says, "I'm glad it's you." It's much better. as i think because the viewer creates their own sound and that sound is completely different for every viewer, just brilliant. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk 16 years old.
