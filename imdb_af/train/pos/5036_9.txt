Bill Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, surprised me with his debut as director of Frailty. He hits all cylinders, but there is an impossibility near the end that the FBI agent (Power Booth) entails, drawing a point of this otherwise cold and thought-producing thriller. Other than that, this movie wasn't good. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays dad. He never gave a first name, but it is not a weakness of the film. It really strengthens the film so that the viewer can see him as a kind of symbol of some kind. He has a vision one day he says he was sent from God, telling him that the world is coming to an end and that he and his two sons, Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter ) the demons must kill and kill them. . The demons look like ordinary people who kill them, and it makes the viewer wonder if Dad just lost his head, or does he really do God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points that add to the confusion and give the movie more tension. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback by one of the boys who are growing up now (Matthew McConaughey) and talking to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Power Booth) who is very skeptical and legal. It is not every day that someone comes to your office to tell you that he knows who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> The movie has lots of twists, and Bill Paxton regulates wonderfully by letting us know without losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leaders and Paxton work well together, resembling a normal family, although they are all involved in murder. As I said, the one indifference that includes the character of Powers Booth, but it's not really a big deal. It was an extremely well-made film in terms of faith and family.
