This movie is of course low budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this film convincing (in California and late 60's) were well thought out. I believe it's the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac murders that plagued the town of Vallejo and the Bay area from 1968-19? Edward James Olmos (Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen, as it was cleared by DNA and fingerprints) play a game of criminal and criminal crime. screens together, each trying to activate the other in an emotional revelation. Olmos dies of some kind of terminal illness and knows Dzundza still has it completely obsessed with the point of losing his family and getting a full-fledged alcoholic. Dundza completely unaware and absorbed herself (like all serial killers) into the carnage left in her wake. The only disappointment was the "top" which is otherwise reasonably accurate. If you touch the typical Hollywood fluff or are interested in the Zodiac case, watch it.
