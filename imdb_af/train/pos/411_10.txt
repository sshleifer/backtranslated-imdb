This movie is well done on so many levels that I am awe that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) of this writing). This movie has amazing special effects, a true epic story, complex big character interaction, and dazzling battles - they have to be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the captions on the HK DVD version I have (some lines are not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just don't understand when I read and hear from different sources: "it has a confusing plot ....", "I couldn't follow the story ..." or "characters came from nowhere". From the very first time I watched this movie, I understood it, followed it, knew why characters were there, and I absolutely loved it! I've been watching it about 8 times and every time it's pure pleasure. Oh, and that's not just my opinion, because I've shown this movie to many fellow Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie) who feel the same way. None of them did not follow the storyline and every person explained their love for this movie. Oh man, why can't we have such things out of Hollywood? At least, Lord of the Rings, had a good marriage with special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't come from an Asian movie lover. I own an extensive library of Asian movies and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. If you see it, you will be blown away by the wonderful special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantasy world and you will not want to leave! I've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 (both by Tsui Hark), and the 2001 is much better in IMO. <br /> <br /> Apart from the captions, I have one more complaint about this movie: I didn't want it to end. I beg your mr. Hark. Can we please have a prosecution?
