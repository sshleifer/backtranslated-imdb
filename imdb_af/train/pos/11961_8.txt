I thought it was a great way to spend time on a hot summer week, sitting in the luxury theater and watching a light comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is greasy and the characters are equivalent (even the bread loaf supposedly killer). While some are disappointed when they realize it is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen still has full control over the style that many of us have grown. <br /> <br /> It was most I laughed at in one of Woody's comedies (dare I say a decade?). While I was never impressed by Scarlet Johanson, she managed to print her "sexy" image and jump directly into an average but spiritual young woman. <br /> <br /> It should not be the crown jewel. of his career, but it was whiter than 'Devil Wears Prada' and more interesting than 'Superman' a great comedy to watch with friends.
