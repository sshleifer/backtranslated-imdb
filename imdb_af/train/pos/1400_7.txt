Bogmeister and others nailed it pretty much. Shore Leave is really TOS's first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which will be perfect later with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). It made both the crew of the business and its TV viewers a required effort of the universe's imminent effects of, for example, the Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place to visit, the Enterprise has happened on a seemingly idyllic M-class planet, and sending an exploratory team to look closer. All sorts of absurdities will soon begin - some seemingly dangerous - but it seems to be a bit of human emotional extremities played in a strange blend of fantastic puzzles. McCoy went through that sight glass. Psychological thriller by an insatiable bully from his past and romantic comedy (no comment). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all series in the Trek franchise, so it's easy to forget how many episodes in The first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially disastrous drama. Unlike later series of franchise writers, TOS's production team was not afraid to literally go where no TV series went before. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner Ironically gave his legendary sense of humor) could not know how to handle this new wrinkle on ST's themes. The last scene is probably one of the worst scenes I can remember from the whole TOS race - both compositionally and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendation - watch it as you watch the first season, because it was meant to be seen - order it.
