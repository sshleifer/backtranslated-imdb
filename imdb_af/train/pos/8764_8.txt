Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been best friends ever since and after graduating, they decide to take a trip to Thailand. As a result of an incident, they meet a young handsome mysterious stranger who invites them to join him in Hong Kong this weekend. But at the airport Alice and Darlene are confused for drug traffickers heroine and they are sent to jail. Now is the time for ultimate survival and true friendship. It was a good movie, I saw it a few times and afterwards you see that they are some holes in the plot, but the movie still keeps you entertained. As usual, Claire Danes did a good job, she is a great actress. I'll give Brokedown Palace 8/10
