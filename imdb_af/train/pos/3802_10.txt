Dragon Hunters should be the best animated movie I've ever seen. It was jawbone. The movie is about a few villains looking for cash, their strange, furry blue dog that burns and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight. They are sent to go to the ends of the earth to kill. world gobbler, an impossible big dragon. But honestly it's not even about the movie. Because it is jaw-droppingly beautiful. The gravity of this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float amidst cathedrals and castles and villages, and there are forests of floating lily blocks. The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a kind of muted storybook looking at it. The world looks like a set of beautiful paintings. The monsters are also visually amazing, like a fire dragon consisting of a swarm of evil red bats. Some of the plots are not too original, like the main characters who want their farm to have a mouse and men's and never make it into the world; But the beautiful graphics, some serious sinister scenes and a dialogue with emotion call make this spectacle spectacular.
