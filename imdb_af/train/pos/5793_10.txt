Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story of the movie starts, we get a performance of the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and it kicks off a good movie. Then we get a kind of collage from Michael carrier, as it was until Moonwalker came out in 1988. After some music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) start the story. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) through the bad guy of the story, Big, being pursued because they discovered his evil plans to get children around the world on drugs. During the race we see fantastic segments, eg. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance series, etc. But then one of the children is kidnapped by Mr Big, and Michael will have to save her before getting a drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the movie, our special effects not only look great for those days' standards, but also impressive today. See, for example, Michael going to a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a performance of Come Together (later published in Michaels double album of HIStory), and you leave the movie with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend it for every family who wants to spend a nice evening with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can get up and say, "But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuse!" Yes, he is, but come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ..
