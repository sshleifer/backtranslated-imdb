Alain Delon visits fast, surely revenge on the relentless crime family who used him as a hit in the Duccio Tessari thriller "Big Guns" after accidentally killing his wife and child. Tessari and scenarios Roberto Gandus, one-minute prayer Ugo Liberatore, a second to die, "and Franco Verucci of" Ring of Death ", take this action on a career scavenger for the crowd to the wire. Indeed, "Big Guns" is quite predictable, but still qualifies as solid entertainment with very cruel and often sudden murders. Alain Delon of "The Godson" is appropriately laconic, as he points out the deaths of gang family members methods, who refused to allow him to retire so he can enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the greenhouse with the Delon character, but the rest of his stubborn associates want to kill the hit. Like most crime generators in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" endorses the film morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the woman and the son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari doesn't waste a moment in this 90-minute shoot. Except that the mother and son die in a car bomb intended for the father, finding the worst thing happens in a car's mountain farm when an associated hero is crushed in a spilled car. Immediately, "Big Guns" is a pretty bloodless outing, but it has a high body number for a 1973 mobster melodrama. Only at the last moment does our protagonist leave his vigilance, and therefore the contracted morality of an eye remains an eye intact. Tessari stages some decent motor hunters and the death of a shoe in a train moving through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets. The photography and the compositions are excellent.
