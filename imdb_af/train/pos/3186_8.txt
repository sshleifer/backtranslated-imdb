I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humor is light and clean, and because the storyline in which faulty identity is involved is very common, I look forward to how this movie erases this story. It seems to be very nice. The performance of the female head is admirable; Her portrayal of an innocent, na√Øve girl trying to make white lies to David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also find Vera's dance done very, very well. I find myself drawn on her toes, as she performs effortlessly and flawlessly across the stage. <br /> <br /> For those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies today, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
