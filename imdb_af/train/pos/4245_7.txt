If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound like it should be. This is because Anita Loos who wrote the script also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that movie, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of men's men's jewelry. <br /> <br /> These are men who mean Jean Harlow is behind. She leaves the roadhouse by her mother and stepfather, because she has decided that the best way to get the easy life is to marry it. Her talent as a chorus girl is limited, but she will be able to deal with that beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey starts with her and friend Patsy Kelly gets an invitation to act at a party that is being thrown by millionaires. Lewis Stone. But unbeknownst to Jean, Stone only has a wild final fling before he does himself because of the money he doesn't owe. Yet she made a few snaps from him, which co-millionaire Lionel Barrymore remarks. <br /> <br /> Lionel is amused by that until Jean sets her sights on his playboy son, Franchot Tone. Then he is not amused and he seems to shake Jean to climb the pedigree. <br /> <br /> The Missouri girl started production of the code in production so that it went under strange censorship. I have a feeling that we have seen a lot more risqu√© movie. Still Jean Harlow as a younger and sassier version of Mae West is always appreciated. What a great comic talent the woman had, see The Girl From Missouri, is a sad reminder of the great loss of the world of film passed with her, three years later. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Patsy Kelly's decision with Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the successful shorts Kelly made with another well-known platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between Patsy and Thelma. Todd will also die a year later in a freak accident / suicide / murder that a satisfactory statement has never been given. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the Missouri girl, it's bright and salty, must be out of all the sparkling jewelry.
