Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being appointed by a lone cyclist. She is shaken by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker forced his way to Marjorie's house and subjected her to humiliating terror. Brown and bloody, Marjorie succeeds in getting an upper hand on her attacker, knocking out the living daylight and making him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat. Hog tied himself up and tried to explain himself to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfri Woodard) when they got home. There is almost a hint of grace, but it doesn't come from Marjorie. Should she continue her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and coarse language make for an R rating. Fawcett really gets rid of those roles that her career will stain forever. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.
