This film never got the attention it deserved, though it is one of the best ensemble plays, and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on the screen. It becomes clear on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital, the centerpiece of the story is Joel, played very well by Eric Stoltz. Joel is paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and arrives at a hospital with other men who have back injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of her later Academy Award. <br /> <br /> Although the Joel-Anna ratio is the basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the hall. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the evil Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist blast. I think Forsythe's two best scenes are when he gets frustrated and angry at the square dancers. And later he felt empathy for a young Korean man shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is the discussion of sexual options after injuries. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate, but not free, sexual scenes. The orgasm in the hall is sexy and amusing. There is also an unforgettable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially equipped bus to the strip bar. This is really a comedy of mistakes, as they make their poor attempts to get the bus to see the "naked ladies". <br /> <br /> The story is even more touched by the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. It's basically his story. This movie is really, not shiny or flashy. Having the amount of talent in a movie of such a small budget is wonderful. I recommend this movie to everyone I see, because it is one of those movies that even improves at a second glance. It is a pity that such a huge piece of work is overlooked, but through video, it may get the attention it deserves so richly.
