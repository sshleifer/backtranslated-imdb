Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read through the other comments before I looked briefly. I have to say I disagree with most negative comments or problems people have had with them. <br /> <br /> As a first time director / producer of Lone Wolf, I like to see things I can strive for, not necessarily the pros, but people just wet their feet like me. <br /> <br /> If it's really from a first timer, as I read, I rejoice. Wonderful work then in that respect! There were some remarks about the music. I thought it was quite nice for the piece. Sometimes it says drunk for a while, but I found that tension without being aware of it, and when he pulled out the gun and the guitar started to choke, it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks, But realize it is just moving. Yes, there is a 180 degree slip / clip in it, but shi * happens. Does anyone else see Hugh's dirty shirt getting white (near the end, in the rain) in Australia? See how much money and people were behind that movie! Give the child a break for God's being! All in all, I think it was done very well. Just 2 things I would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning. Do not walk to a shiny copper frame with the camera, and I would just show the blast at the beginning shots to a snapshot, so people do not necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that it is not difficult to make a movie, it just takes time to learn how to do it, then the time to do it really is. And then you take even more time to think about all the details you'll have to shoot before calling "after-production time"! IMHO, it looks like director / writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if it's his first report card, I'll give him a "A". The rest of you report to the head office for a whuppin '.
