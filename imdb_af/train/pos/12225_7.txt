I saw this movie and even though I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still loved to see it. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on a lifetime movie network quite a lot. And I think because it's near Halloween, they can play it more. So beware of this if you are interested in looking at it. I believe Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really like her as an actress and person. She looks so beautiful and down to earth. Kevin Dillon's performance was so good for me. I'm not trying to beat him or anything, but I believe his brother Matt could better pull this bad evil serial killer. Kevin just looks too sweet for me. But I think he did well.
