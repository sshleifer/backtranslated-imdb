Jane Porter's former love interest Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his girlfriend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) come to Tarzan's hidden jungle platformer. They are looking for the ivory gold mine which is the "Elephant's Cemetery" which was first seen in Tarzan, the APE MAN. only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions ... namely Jane. Will Tarzan stand for it? Not likely (in fact, Tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance to the Elephant's cemetery) and know Martin is trying to take Tarzan out of the picture, but later he finds himself in a world of trouble, he and his party, including Jane who left with them after believing that Tarzan was dead, was captured by a native tribal target to feed them to the lions. Will Tarzan be enough to come to them in time? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with adventure with lots of scenes that Tarzan and others who fall wild animals, and a climax that emphasizes the viewer's interest and does not allow. The cruelty shown to animals and the portrayal of indigenous people may disturb some today, but everyone should remember it is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and should not be taken as seriously.
