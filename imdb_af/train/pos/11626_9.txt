This is an excellent, fast-paced tension by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), who left the supernatural for 85 minutes and advances us with something even more frightening - the evil of man. We are much more likely to experience Jackson Rippner's auspicious anger as Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a cozy, friendly, even charismatic killer. The performances by Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, of The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is on a small scale, not the broad swipe of the cloth, and it is no less compelling for these restrictions. The cinematography is nothing special, but of course one can do as much with a camera in the limit of a passenger beam, but the dialogue is excellent, the story tight. There is no distraction, no subplots confuse the issue which in his heart is a battle between the main characters. Retaining its focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven can take what is a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting, fast-paced action thriller.
