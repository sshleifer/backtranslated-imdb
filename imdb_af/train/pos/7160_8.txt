A Disney movie that dares to do something else should at least be awarded for effort. "Holes" does not make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers sitting in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in detail. The flashback scenes really work out and present several adult topics that can surprise the viewer. I must admit that I was initially fired a little by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Besides the story, this movie also makes a good job of questioning some methods used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to learn Nul to read because they have to dig holes to build character, such as reading, will not contribute to it). "Holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. Have a look!
