For many, Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to be something creative about hip hop culture. <br /> <br /> The young Lee lives in NY in the 80's when hip hop was in the beginning. She is a crew member of "Beat Street" - a b-boy team. The film follows Lee in his average day, dance, graffiti, etc. <br /> <br /> The director managed to make a movie with a plot and offer hip hop to the rest of the world. The film has old school features such as <br /> <br /> Africa Bambaataa & Soul Sonic Force, Grand Master Melle Mel & the Furious Five, Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers, and many more .... < br /> <br /> Not the movie Beat Street or the Beat Street spirit will ever die.
