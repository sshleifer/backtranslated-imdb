Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found it a valuable movie. While the details might be dramatized, overall history was a nice primer. In addition, I found mocking actors I really enjoyed. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a deadly cat? I'll make the rest of the star mock. Regarding the secondary casting movie, this movie (as expected from a movie made in the late 1930s) has been a very pleasant character actor, but the best of Andrew Jackson's right hand Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships, and skillful action throughout, I recommend it to anyone with a taste for the light camp, or an eye for a dual-time piece set at the beginning of America and in a made period. Names, and top character character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.
