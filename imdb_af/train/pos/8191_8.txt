The Impossible Planet and Satan Pit together consist of the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor whose second season. Having said that, it should be clear that much of the story basically converts the Quatermass and the Pit plot (1967) into an outer space environment, with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the Beast 666. The cement of this episode the emotional ties between Rose and the Doctor, while also emphasizing Rose's increasing self-confidence and establishing her as a non-just-but-but-there partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also note is Matt Jones's elegant screenplay, which occasionally reduces confidence on one-liners for the doctor, and the performances of the entire role, especially the excellent Shaun Parkes as acting captain Zachary Cross Flane.
