It's a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where the Chaos Theory is summed up by telling a butterfly's wings, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about it (or at least something, don't worry, it's not fairy tale). I'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in pre-ordered things, fate, but this movie definitely makes you wonder whether it really happens to exist ... <br /> <br /> Also, the acting and the camera is also excellent, the other proves that it is still possible to make a good movie without a million dollars
