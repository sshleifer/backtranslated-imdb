49. PAPER HOUSE (vibrator / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with fever 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has just her drawings to keep her company. Her health is gradually worsening as a series of mysterious 'black outs' grab her. In each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a deserted field, with only a sickly-invalid son named Marc (Elliot Spiers) living in it. When a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic "paperhouse", Marc's life is compromised. Her life is also in jeopardy, as these dreams reflect her own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The Hague's first debut feature by British director Bernard Rose. Taken from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, it leaves many other "original" fantasy works in its wake. When a story is about dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give it a mix of fable and reality to make it work in film form. Director Rose has successfully captured the children's fantasy world aspect, along with a darkness they are striving for. <br /> <br /> Feverishly achieved by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with a quick 'jump from your seat' moments. Most thrillers are very sloppy in this all-important aspect to scare the audience from not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he takes up tension and never allows it to go slow in the following sequence of events. Also, his ability to place objects within the frame (as in his P.O.V. shots) gives cinematography an extra dimension that otherwise seems to be lacking. Only in Europe will you find such ominous places such as those presented here: the lonely house, the fields, the coastal villages, the watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose will follow this movie with Candyman (1992), a true 'person's' horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite.
