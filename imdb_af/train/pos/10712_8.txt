This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (the movie by Tim Burton). But it is less glamorous and more in your face story. And of course here it is not the father, but his grandfather telling the stories. <br /> <br /> The movie's story also moves back and forth (so the story about it at IMDb can tell you more than you want to read before watching the movie). It's funny and tempting enough, though you go from one story to another and have some dramatic moments. It also surprises you here and there, with things you wouldn't expect. A good little movie then, it deserves your attention, especially if you want such movies! : O)
