I read many commandments when they were in the theaters and they were all bad. I think you should be some kind of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who enjoys the Waltons or Little House, you will not understand whether these movies enjoy. <br /> <br /> Now about Love, Lasting Joy ... I knew he was bad news from the start of the movie .... I wish it would have shown more of the end instead of you just to think. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff .... it's 6 years later so you know he'll be interested in Girls. <br /> <br /> I'd say I've enjoyed all four movies so far. ... Wasn't crazy about the books ... Can't wait for the next movie. The way Clark talks will get you every time. I'd like to see Jan Jones make an appearance ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
