Okay. Yes, it was a very strict budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes filmed naturally in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I like Nick Mancuso, he was often a little too good at burning-off, and some of the minor supporting role-playing was really bad (plus at least one actor was using two different but striking roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some good lines, while Nancy Allen was ironically quite thin and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertainment Like? Great yes. I would have loved to be the day they decided what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. "Are you quick?" ... "You don't have that fast."
