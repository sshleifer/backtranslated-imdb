A chemist develops a substance that is never dirty or thrown out, but is considered a threat to the survival of various industries. In this beautiful Ealing Studios comedy, Guinness is wonderful as the gentle but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays the love interest; Parker is her married father. Thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the dust industry. While telling an interesting story, the film also raises some interesting questions about science, the economy, and politics. It is being used by Mackendrick, who would make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success" in the 1950s.
