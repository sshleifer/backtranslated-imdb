- After their boys have been sentenced to life imprisonment, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) receive threatening calls because someone falls to their sons, becoming easy. The couple decide to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that will be very successful soon. One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is picking up rabbits and fading a little with an evangelist on the radio. It is only a while before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can't help but compare What is Helen's case? to whom Tannie Roo hit, also starring Shelly Winters. Where the movie was almost in his representation of Aunt Roo's insanity, there's nothing Helen likes in this movie. It can take a good part of the movie's running time, but as soon as she snaps, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You don't wanna mess with her. Winters is so pleased that it was impossible for me to enjoy her performance. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but the things Helen is capable of are completely over-the-top. <br /> <br /> As well as Winters, Reynolds is completely ridiculous in her role as the gold poet tap dancer. I got the impression she thought she was in a movie that would be nominated for an award. This is not Citizen Kane! Stop acting so seriously. Hey, Debbie, you don't realize your main purpose is to be a victim of winter madness. <br /> <br /> - I just love these former female star-in-the-twilight-of-their-career horror movies. What is the matter with Helen? is as nice as any.
