It's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their children. I felt instead of a movie ticket, I had to receive a NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> Based on Thomas Rockwell's respected book, a broken worm begins to eat, like any children's story: to a new town. The new child, fifth-degree Billy Forrester was once popular, but needs to start again. Making friends is never easy, especially as the only prospect is Poindexter Adam. Whether Erica, which is 4 1/2 feet, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Further complicated things are Joe's bully. His spoken face and sleek shirts are frightening. He antagonizes children with the Death Ring: a Crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you when punched with it. But not immediately. No, the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight degree. <br /> <br /> Joe and his evil welcomed Billy by smuggling a handful of slim worms into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays it cool, swearing that he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them at Joe's face. EWWW! To win, Billy wins with unwillingness to eat 10 worms. Grilled, cooked, marinated in warm sauce, pumped and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Every meal is called an exotic name, such as the "Radioactive Slime Delight", in which the children finally live out their dream to save a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you've ever met me, you'll know I have an uncontrollable laugh. I felt like a creep that erupted at a toddler who made her "dilly dick" hurt. But Fried Worms are wonderfully disgusting. Like a G-rated Farrelly brothers movie, both are brave and beautiful. <br /> <br /> Author / director Bob Dolman is also a talented storyteller. To increase the game, the worms must be digested at 19:00. In addition, Billy has a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a good perspective. With such accuracy, he draws the children's uncertainties and tendencies to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you want to hyperbolize this movie as the kids do their quandaries, you'll see it's actually about war. Freedom fighter and freedom hatred use cruel boys as pledges in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn a thing or two about the worldwide peace of Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was comforted when two virgins were asleep behind me, looking at each other and having agreed. It was a good movie. "Big, now I don't have to register in any legitimate databases.
