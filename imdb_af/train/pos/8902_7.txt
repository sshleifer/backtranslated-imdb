I think if Steve McQueen knew he would be an icon and start "Wanted Dead of Alive" that same year, this film came out, or two years later in The Magnificent Seven, he wouldn't have done it. But he did it, and we are the richer for it. <br /> <br /> Sure it's a classic camp. Horror as it was meant to be for the drive-in theater. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the last line of the movie was: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> <br /> They would never have suggested 52 years ago that the Arctic would be thawed. The Blob will return soon.
