For whom games play games, anyone has noticed that the CTA: Vice City Mansion in the game and a few other things including weapons from the movie linked to this movie and this movie inspired the creators of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy a few things from this movie and the way it is one of the best 80's movies there, I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it yet 10/10 asked no questions
