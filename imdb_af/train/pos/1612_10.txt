This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It's virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is fascinating and beautiful! <br /> <br /> Each character is exceptionally delightful and memorable, from the leaders Cher and Nicolas Cage played to the many supporting roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandpa with his doggy suit ! Each of these artists, plus Norman Jewison as director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For many of the actors it was an early big exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional - and we have many current acting power stations whose careers have been changed by their efficiency in this movie. <br /> <br /> I've been through this movie several times - which can significantly break the impact of a movie. More tellingly, a few years ago I realized that when I filmed my way into a scene from this movie - any scene - the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. There are so many beautiful and memorable scenes the original encounter between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his story of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered his opera opera, amid the splendor generated by his gold mining industry; Olympia Dukakis scolds John Mahoney to talk to his student in the classic line about liaison with co-workers: "Don't where you eat!"; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bed; Nicolas Cage "takes" Cher as the rapture of an aria in the background! <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The apartment. <br /> <br /> Not quite equal to Moonstruck!
