I'm a sucker for movies like this. Movies that take you back and revive your childhood. I am big now and have great responsibilities such as a bond, children, dogs, a woman and a lot of others. I enjoy my life, but it is not as innocent and carefree as it was when I was twelve. Mike Binder's Indian Summer knows it and investigates it as he was twelve years old. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. It brings you back to a time when you worry about your first kiss and wonder if you could complete the camp marathon, major issues. Indian Summer is a fantastic movie and it is one that has to be watched at least once a year, just so you can lean and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as childhoods are returning to Camp Tamakwa by their former chief camp adviser, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou is played perfectly by Alan Arkin. He is a kind of man who is the patriarch of the group. He also knows all the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. He has a hard time relating to today's children who have to leave a hiker in their ears when they are in a place of great beauty like Tamakwa. It is a camp where the moose wanders through the camp, turns the colors God has given them and sees water as far as the eye can see. Uncle Lou longs for the days of old and asks his former campers back to camp to see that one of them will take over the camp. As they all meet again, we get their trials and tribulations and maybe a new love can jump between them. <br /> <br /> As the adults return to the camp, it's not long before they act like kids again, as the typical gameplay games are played everywhere. They take toilet paper from the stalls, put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. All these things are done scary and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, it's all very funny. <br /> <br /> But beyond the hilarity, we're going to explore some very real adult emotions that everyone can talk to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins overlook a bay where they can go canoeing. Pollak can't tell how small it looks and Perkins finally tells him that the bay has not diminished, they just grew bigger. It doesn't hammer the point at home, but it does it subtly. We all grow up, we all go on and unfortunately we can't live like we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> Indian summer is a character-driven movie and it is beautifully written by Mike Binder who actually attended Camp Camp Tamakwa. (Like Sam Raimi, who has played Sam Raimi Stick in the movie) and it's his good and vibrant memories of his experiences burning the movie. There is a lot of touch tone and there is also a lot of hilarious. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it and it's a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
