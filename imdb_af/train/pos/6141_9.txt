Angela Lansbury plays Eglantine a middle-aged lady in war-torn England during WWI. She is studying witchcraft by post and has secretly taught it in her home. It is going well with her, until three children separated from the previous air raid are sent to stay in Angela Lansbury's big house. She is not happy to have them, because of her secret. They just want to go back home. The eldest son is very hard to go with he's a brat. The other two are a boy and a girl is just curious about their new place to stay and the woman their hostess. The kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins. Fun and more of it. Family Fun. Laughter, French, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are pretty good. It's a musical the songs are so catchy every time to sing later than any of the other Disney movies. Add it to your family video library. You won't be disappointed.
