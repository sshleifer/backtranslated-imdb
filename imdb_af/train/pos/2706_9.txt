I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought he would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (like Mr. Wood), it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And it's cool. The big joke I woke up early The day I die is that it's not even a decent movie. <br /> <br /> It makes the movie very, very good. The writing is filled with nihilism and anarchism - very black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely excellent. You see, it's either high art ... or low junk. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
