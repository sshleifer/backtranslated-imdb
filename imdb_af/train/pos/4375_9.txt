Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacular film, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the other hand, is slightly less polished, but a better movie by far. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historic values, while Braveheart places a brutal and unpleasant, comtemporary glamor on an ancient story. What makes this movie is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically defended in the Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but is not the greatest fighter or the most demonic lover. Properly but humanly, he recommends the screen. Against him is a selection of equally human opponents, including Tim Roth's Cunningham, petty but brilliant, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt laird. Also to be praised is Jessica Lange, as Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, who must be the same. It's not the most original movie you will see, but it has the courage of its own beliefs, and the strong performances make you care.
