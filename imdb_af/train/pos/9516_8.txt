Tom Hanks like you never saw him. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is a hitman for his surrogate couple John Rooney (Paul Newman) an elderly Irish bully. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) testifies to what his father is doing for a life and both are robbing banks for seven weeks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer who is willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of dead people photos. Filmed captured the drama of life in the 30's. Sometimes the tempo falls, but then there is some graphic violence. Director Sam Mendes leads this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bond of a mysterious man and his young son. Other well-known role players are Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks proves excellent in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
