For me, a matter of life and death is just the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> From start to finish harvest this class. It is stimulating, thought-provoking, a mirror for the post-war world and relations between people. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of monochrome and Technicolor to accentuate the different worlds works seamlessly. The characters and plot development are almost perfect and attention to detail promotes a thorough credible fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I watched it a lot - it never touches me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It's as fresh as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I had only allowed one movie to watch and a life and death case would be that movie.
