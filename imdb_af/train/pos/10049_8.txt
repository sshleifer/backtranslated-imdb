I'm not a parent, and I'm not a man. But I could identify with each character's grief and pain. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that teenagers have to watch. Maybe they will appreciate the value of the family again. I'm sorry for those who don't understand the value of love, family, and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role from Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see a 19-year-old Ben Affleck giving his best in an exciting and sincere performance. He showed at an early age that he was able to think heartily. He must be offered more serious roles. Notice Hollywoodland ... its first serious role in years and in 2006 he won the best actor at the Venice Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps children should not be under 10 because they may be afraid that the same can happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched It with friends many times. Because it portrays the values ​​that are important in life.
