I really enjoyed this movie. Most of the reviews are bad, but most critics believe a movie should be like an idea drama. This movie has some drama, but the rest is just fun and fun. Forget that Julia Roberts is a Pretty Woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that. Emma was so nice to watch the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe she goes far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on the books, but the story is still good. There is also a good combination of other character actors and supporting actors like Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited. I'm surprised Disney did not release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and curse. It's a good family movie that's scarce on this day. So take your family, see this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can't wait for the successor.
