Before I see this movie, I see a lot of comments, all of which have a good view of the movie. Good or bad ... What I really want to show is the actions of Woody Harrelson He can't be in many parts of the movie, but when he appears or even the intro, I was surprised at Will Smith and Woody Harrelson's message "what they are trying to create and maybe slip the whole plot to the end to really understand what is going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not a very sentimental person, I believe a good deed shouldn't regret it. But an act of showing salvation, there aren't many movies that can show in my view. This is one of those that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with one person commenting on this movie that suicide acts are a downfall, but I don't believe this is the movie's message. try to send, but "sacrifice". A little to the extreme, but this is the message in MY opinion. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. The acting is worth every penny, the writing is incredible. from a person who doesn't really like watching drama movies. If you like drama, it's a must see.
