For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is about as close to perfection as a movie can get. Whether a mere genius of a brief author or just one of those happy mixes where everything has clicked (probably some of each), this simple, small piece of urban-life-ethnic first love movie rubs off its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. The movie starts with a strong "street" flavor, but works in a Latino family relationship and then focuses on a story that discusses volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the deep natural desire to love another . In my experience, so much has never been done with so few (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). Designated by critics, but not for everyone, Raising Victor Vargas is recommended for Indian lovers and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (A)
