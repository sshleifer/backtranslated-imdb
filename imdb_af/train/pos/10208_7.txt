Rarely do we see such short comments written by IMDb filmmakers. Perhaps this is because this lightweight dark comedy entertaines and pleases without depth, or does it affect us? I'll see it again if I had some incentive. <br /> <br /> So, what's an event? For the French it is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Lot? Perhaps this is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We all had it (it is called life), but if we looked at it, you started to feel that "random" is more like "outdated". <br /> <br /> An 'event' in this movie can be a look that beats as little as a few leaves of lettuce from the back of a truck or as big as an important life decision based on accuracy from a stranger throwing a pebble. All these incidents cause other events ... Well, you get the picture? Domino. Multiply it by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you really have to stretch your imagination to assume the remote chance that this scenario can happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe life is like that. But then it's the magical world of the theater. <br /> <br /> We are pleased to see how the writer / director collaborates on these unrelated events in a story that compromises the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, this is the place to do it. Or if you recover from an operation and do not go anyway, it will involve you while your stitches heal. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" does not go down as an award winner, but it must follow a cult. Stronger things happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is attributed to the following: "Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived in advance." Looking at the detail in many of your own life experiences (to meet your first love, to find the perfect gift, your last car accident), you will find a series of seemingly random events arising from it. <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist to explain to me "Happenstance".
