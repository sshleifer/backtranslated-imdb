An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller, has all the necessary elements. Expressed ex-boxer has become a drifter, alcoholic widow with sinister desires, ex-cop, a small scoundrel and a kidnapped plot destined for punishment. Still, the film never goes into clich√© country, but remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are all excellent, especially Bruce Dern's role as the bad sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a timely uncertainty about the motion of the film, which deliberately or not, adds to the grim proceedings. Highly recommended.
