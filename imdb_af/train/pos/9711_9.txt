Well, I just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy that deals with the most horrible, insane and disgusting little town in the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") pretty normal! The format of the show is much like Little Britain, except that it centers all around the townspeople of this one bright village. Both shows have the same sketches and episodes each and a few inspirational "Little Britain" (especially for class shooting). But the show differs, because although it is rough like "Little Britain" (not a show for kids), the performance has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows. In particular, cruelty and ceremonial death are recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you haven't guessed, it's NOT a show for kids, the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why I liked it. But you really need very thick skin and a love for the terrible to enjoy it to the maximum. Funny and incredibly disrespectful - you have to see it to believe it.
