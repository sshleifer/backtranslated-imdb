It's a very memorable spaghetti western. It has a great story, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villain in this movie is truly classic. She steals every scene she's in and speaks so much to her face and eyes, even when she's not talking. Her performance is very credible. She manages to be quite enchanting without being over it (not that something is wrong with being over). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this movie. <br /> <br /> The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will play in your head for days after you see the movie, whether you want it or not. There are some very amusing parts. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri uses the parrot. There are also very smooth rockets that have been done very well. <br /> <br /> I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first is a silly bar room noise that takes about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous search fights I've ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance music from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might think of it as a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but it's a more serious Western, and the noise really should be more realistic. The other thing that irritated me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican sidekick. I think he's supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need it? <br /> <br /> All I can say is that everyone reads that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western, despite the mistakes I have made. And all the fans of the genre should see this movie.
