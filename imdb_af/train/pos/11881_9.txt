Every major gangster movie has undercurrents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution, and despair of "Scarface". It is a story of angry greed, corruption and power. The darker side of the fabulous "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Anyone complaining about the "cheesiness" of this movie is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheese music and dated fashions further elude the criticism of this life of diabolic remains. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matters, not on any human level. In fact, the film borders virtually with satire, ironic, taking into account all the gangsta rappers who have been positively inspired by Tony Montana's lifestyle. <br /> <br /> It's not Brian DePalma's strongest direct effort, it's sometimes excellent and well-managed (especially the unforgettable finale), but often sinks to sloppy and deceived. Fortunately, it is backed by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, taking into account the coke habit he used to do at that time). The themes are consistent, focusing mainly on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character, as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, it looks easy between humor and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since become popular in some form in popular culture. <br /> <br /> The cast also helps, but it's actually Pacino's movie. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something more common to him today), it is a world completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet, as always, in entertainment, he is in a very entertaining (and deliberately over-the-top) form. It is difficult to imagine another Tony Montana after watching this movie, possibly one of the most imitative shows ever. Pfeiffer was so dull and uncomfortable on first performance, but I realized how she was part of the bored little woman. Not an extraordinary effort, but unfairly judged. The supporting players are also very good, especially Paul Shenar as the southern Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking and constantly controversial. "Scarface" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever you mean). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop culture landmark. 9/10
