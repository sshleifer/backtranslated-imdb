Interestingly, how much more realistic Brosnan's performance is to those of the original James Bond novels compared to the band films. He is neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer to start. It's a perfect break for him, even as much as enjoying the bondage. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. It doesn't get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr. No, and that's how Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fits the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. The wonderful Brosnan plays a character that is both ground-based and flamboyant in reality. A shallow character who is trying to gain an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological issues he has no backing. It's an impressive portrayal, and with Greg Kinear landing him, it's just poet. This movie reminds me of some dynamics between the main characters in "My Blue Heaven", but more sincerely in their coping mechanisms.
