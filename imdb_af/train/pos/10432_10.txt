I must admit that I was at the beginning, was kind of negligent to watch this movie. I thought it was this stupid, small, romantic film about a French woman who met an American train and decided to visit Vienna with him. I wasn't really enchanted by this kind of script because it made me believe it was just a movie. Yet I watched it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a fairly philosophical way and wonder about the fact that we are being sentenced to death in the moment of our birth or that it is a Medieval idea that a couple should rest forever, or that we, people, can sometimes live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was chosen wonderfully (we don't know if they will meet six months later at Vienna's station six months later). In our optimism we hope so. The actors acted in a very good way, so I started believing that I might live a love story.
