I have loved Cream's work because there is such a small and precious catalog of work to hold. Even if they go for a couple of minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad Off of Wheels of Fire), it's the best examples to make the socks work even more than half a given rock act . This power to gel on stage is one of the most anticipated rock band reunions ever made with their Royal Albert Hall performances last year. They may have grown older, just like their fans, but the energy is still there, with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own. The comments of the White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine or Your Love do not seem to miss a beat. Clapton's solos have a formation he sometimes doesn't have on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker said enough. Jack Bruce is firm enough with his chorus, still with a kind of force that Clapton could never get on his own. Bottom line, if you want to see what the best shows you'd seen last year (well, some might have seen them), this is all on this DVD, with cool special features.
