Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, synchronized with German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, subtitled in Danish or German. When I watched it in Mannheim, Germany, the response from the Turkish-speaking audience proved that there should be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which I regrettably mostly escaped, but just made imperfect in the captions.

And most importantly, the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama over the coming age; Yet there is a bit of movement in the characters: Look at the villain Omar, whose part and acting I liked very much. <br /> <br /> The contrast of speed and silence contributes to the portrayal of human anger and dignity. - shown in the same characters simultaneously.
