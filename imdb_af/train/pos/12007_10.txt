This is one of the most spiritual movies I've ever seen. I went to St George with about 150 people and we have this movie in the visitor center of the St. George Temple seen. Not one person had dry eyes in the audience. There were also some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the fascinating music and re-enactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced. because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about Joseph and the hardships the pioneers have suffered. This is beyond American history.
