I do not understand your objections to this movie. This is an exciting, exciting extension of the character created in "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is least unrealistic is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in jail on this late date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we have been presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character kills all these people because she is crazy (Risk addict); 2) David Thewlis's crooked police murder these people to frame Sharon Stone's character; 3) David Morrissey's analyst killed these people for revenge. What disturbs most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories is ever expressed as the "real" story. (Although the analyst in a psychiatric care facility is killing the police, the only killer on the screen is killing.) <br /> <br /> I think it's a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001, a Space Odyssey. "WHO cares what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the policeman is really crooked and the analyst wants revenge. What matters is the interaction between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie.
