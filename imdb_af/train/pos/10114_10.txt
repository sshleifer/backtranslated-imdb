"The ghost world of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary about the life of the man who brought us such movies as Glen or Glenda, "Bride of the Monster", and of course "Outside Space Plan 9". This beautiful movie far exceeded where other documentaries such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion" failed. This makes his surviving pursuit, many of which have passed since filming, and gives an honest inquiry into Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back in the dark corner of the older Hollywood, sentimental in dealing with the director (to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who is director of the director in his day. The entire two hours of the film love and retrospectively bring Ed's life and untimely death to the viewer. Best watch at 03:00 while wearing an angora jersey.
