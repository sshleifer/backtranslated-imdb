While watching this movie, I started to feel very nostalgic. If a child grows up in a rural area, I felt like I was a child again! The swimming pond (called a "tank" in Central Texas), running through the countryside like a wild free spirit! The story was very credible and I completely lost it and cried in the end. Through the pain we go through life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
