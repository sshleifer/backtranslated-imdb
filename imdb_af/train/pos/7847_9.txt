Believe it or not, after 12 minutes this movie (for 1912) is a full movie. Much, very few movies were longer than that, but it's definitely NOT what sets this odd little movie apart from the rest! No, what is different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are mistakes ... yes, mistakes! This simple, small household comedy could look as much as productions like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder. Instead, they use Russian production errors (or I think models that look just like errors). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy have not been discovered yet and I assume that Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! With the stop movement the bugs moved and danced and fought incredibly well - and a little more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Mr. Beetle sneaking for a good time. He goes to a bawdy club while his wife is waiting at home. But unfortunately for Mr. Beetle is captured by a local filmwoman on camera. Plus, he doesn't know, but Mrs. Beetle is also working on a bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, there is much more to this household comedy than this, but the plot is centuries old and very entertaining for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Weird but also great and viewable.
