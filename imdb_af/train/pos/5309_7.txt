The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It's full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played attractive by Edward Furlong), who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt ("he's a thief, but he's really good guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother living in a statue of the Virgin Mary discovered in her room. <br /> <br /> The movie gently makes a point about how every day life has plenty of wealth to offer, and it manages to make this point without carrying over. There is always a risk when you make messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", to move into a kind of reverse "saint than you", but "Pecker" avoids this fall, so the audience can get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie, mostly because it's a lot of fun.
