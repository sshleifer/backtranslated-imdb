The invisible man is a show that everyone loves! It reminds me of the old school's 80-series (a-team, airwolf, knight). The special effects are small but very effective !! But what's most important is the fun they've shot this series. It really shows! the whole cast fits perfectly into roles and they seem to be able to do what they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! to me it's amazing that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting. Not shot in a big movie. (Mr Tarantino, it was the show you had to target! Instead of showing the big boring tomb if you can. Well worth it!)
