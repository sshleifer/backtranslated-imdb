If someone ever asks if cinema is an art form, you can be worse than showing it to this movie. <br /> <br /> It's simply the perfect combination of story, script, actors and movies ever connected to celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a doomed bomber pilot missed by his heavenly conductor in the English fog during the second world war, and his subsequent brushes with the heavenly authorities (or in his head) played with panic by David Niven and Kim Hunter and is incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot (Niven) describes his condition to the ground radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The sense of other worldliness is enhanced by Jack Cardiff's photography and the incredible production designs. <br /> <br /> The tallest attacks extend to the celestial shots presented in black and white and terrestrial scenes in Technicolor - even called by the heavenly conductor (a fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not only a high point in the British cinema, but a highlight in the theater, period.
