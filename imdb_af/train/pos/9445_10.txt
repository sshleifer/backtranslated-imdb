This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw it, I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started watching before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was really shocked to think, "What kind of sick movie is it?". Today I saw it from the beginning and I really understand how good this movie really is. It is exciting, frightening, shocking and upset in its own unique way. But the best thing about this is the end where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. It will torture their conscience and they will worry about the bodies found in that river for the rest of their lives. And there's nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This ending is one of the most unfortunate endings in film history and very clever, brilliant and frightening <br /> <br /> And the play is also good, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Beautiful act in this movie. All in all, John Boorman created one of the best movies in the entire film history based on Dick Chaney's novel. A must have for all movie lovers
