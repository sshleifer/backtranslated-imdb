Another entry in the category "holiday horror" that fills the shelves of your local video store. The * spoiler * "wrong nerdy teenager takes revenge on the" cool "children who have wronged him" will of course be known to those who have previously looked at it. And those who have seen it before will probably see it again; Those who expect Ingmar Bergman and later become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy - go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.
