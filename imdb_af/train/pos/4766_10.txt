It is unusual to see a film where the actions of a single actor are so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest, if any, without its presence. <br /> <br /> Despite an outstanding direction - In fact, there are many scenes that were shot too quickly and carelessly - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants the place of A drowning priest and another weekly point, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one is shocked from the beginning to the terrible end. <br /> <br /> I've never seen or can perform better for iomagine for the future, even Paul Scofield who is in a man for all seasons. <br /> <br /> Actually, the end could even be ridiculously considered if Fresnay didn't play the transtorned priest returning to the Church by doing a crime. <br /> <br /> "You're Maurice Morand, Prètre Catholique" ("I'm Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") is said with such brilliance that one can forget the madman The other impressive thing this movie , is a single scene in which Morand - who, despite being a skinned one, is a priest - a cabaret in a cabaret carries a large amount of wine turns it into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gerard - the man who wants to return Morand to the church or replace himself - must drink it if he doesn't want to leave the cabaret. He does so in the midst of cheers and applause of people who think he's drinking only three out of four jerks. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dialogue between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you stay away from men too?" asked Morand, who hates himself for what he just did. "It'll be too much work" is the smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is not worth commenting on, but it's definitely worth seeing because of the very strong and strange emotional atmosphere that's been created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Le Défroqué" is a very strange movie, but must be seen by all viewers. If it is good catholiques, it is mandatory because it is a very rare jewell in film history. <br /> <br />
