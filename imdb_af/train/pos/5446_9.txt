National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's that combines unique characters, lots of fun and some good music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is completely humiliated by his classmates in their high school studies, he takes the opportunity to take revenge at his class meeting. One by one he exhibited his classmates with an innocent blind girl, a horde fat, high school beauty, the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served all the little ones at high school. This film has a kind of scary element in it and it has some short scenes of sexuality, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children, but it's a good movie for teenagers. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or killer special effects you might not love from Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some fun and lots of fun (and who doesn't) then this movie should be on your movies to see list. ++
