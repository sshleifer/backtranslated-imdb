I saw Thief for the first time as a child that makes me almost as old as the Jinn I think. Like any kid, I was delighted with the imagination, ingenuity and energy of the movie. A few years later I realized how much of the satire and whites of the script I missed on the first show. I have never been given the opportunity to look through the intervening years. In addition to the dissertation, the production spans the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at its best. If you see Thief as a child, you know you've had a good time. If you see an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It's as timeless as the story it covers. A wonderful job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
