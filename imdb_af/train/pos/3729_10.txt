While I think this movie could be the rap as Anti-Vietnam, while I watch it, I didn't feel that was the case, because the movie was just a glance in the perspective of the young guys trained for a war that did not support the public .... it showed their fear, their despair, their drive ... all in the open, naked. As a soldier, I have gained many of the themes in my experience in the army - especially boat camp. In general, this movie, although shot on a very small budget, looks good, is very well-crafted, and features excellent acting and direction. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for another great Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
