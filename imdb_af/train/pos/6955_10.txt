My Super X girlfriend is a hell of a rollercoaster ride. The special effects were excellent and the costumes worn by Uma Thurman were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underestimated comic actress, but she has all proven wrong and nailed her role as the ugly girl. She was simply FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was also good as average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the best actresses of all time. The supporting role play was also excellent, especially Anna Faris, who was extremely good. (Much better than in the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did well to target this movie because if it wasn't for him and Uma Thurman would not have done this movie well. This movie is obviously a 10/10 because it's thrown (Uma Thurman), it's director, it's script and its original plot line. This film is highly recommended.
