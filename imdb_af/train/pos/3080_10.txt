I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, it might be enough to bring this fantastic show back! Just go to the official website and the rest is simple enough. I don't understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is appealing! I'm surprised my favorite show is over after just one series. Why is it? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV shows out there! Until I heard them stop it from a friend, it didn't even happen to me that it might happen.
