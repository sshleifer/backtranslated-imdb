Two things haunt you throughout L'intrus (the intruder): who is the intruder and is it a movie or dream you are watching? The end is so shocking that you have a loss for a while to answer one of the questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances who do not belong in the scene, so they are kindly or cruelly suspended, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a miserable man. He has rough ways, some work and no heart. He needs one and then goes on. He has transplanted a heart and decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his quest for salvation? A man like this can cut your throat at the drop of a hat. You know it, but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. Sometimes there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who appears to be between heaven and earth - who judges him. She may even punish him. But not Denis. There is the character Beatrice Dalle has played, who doesn't want any business with him. Don't touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, rolling him into his self-absorbed quest. I don't know if it's what its films are the heart or mind, but it's not the traditional plot basics. Whatever movies, you get it in the end. You know who the "intruder" is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
