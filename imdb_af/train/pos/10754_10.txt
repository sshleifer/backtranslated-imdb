I was a bit skeptical if I had to see it when it was first shown to CBS. I was one of many people that day in NYC, I went to Hunter College. I didn't want to see all the deviation and bloodbath again, but like many I was curious to see what it was all about. Tears looked at my eyes on this documentary. All my memories came back and only the intense images were incredible. I bought the DVD on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times. How these guys could capture these footage was incredible. If you haven't seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and look it out. It is, of course, depressed and will tear eyes, but it is an incredible document from these countries darkest hour.
