I think many viewers have completely missed that this is of course a parody of Western movies. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie - it's a smart language in the cheek that westerners take. I do not believe this movie has taken itself seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more unique is the fact that it is around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of whom are black, one Asian, and a Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> It's not your usual western women - they're tough - they can move quickly and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> They're a little difficult even when the bartender shakes when he throws their whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that moves this story together is typical of westerners - in the bait of "you shot my brother - so I" will get you! "Only in this west is a woman's sister shot and she was revengeful of the gang that did it. <br /> <br /> So she walks around her old cronies from her bank-raising days. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really anyone interested in disregarding Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that there is gold and jewelry in the town they are heading for. . <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that don't make sense, not that they interfere so much, they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. So the movie may increase a bit, but over all, it's a well-made movie that hasn't managed to find an audience who acknowledged what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - from the "heroines", one is obviously straight, the other sexual orientations are never made known. <br /> <br /> 7 Stars
