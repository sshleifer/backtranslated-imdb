My observations: Post-war hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa of "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton good as always; smaller part than in "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington way more beautiful, even with the perky small nose missing by Hamilton. Tent scene at the end with the former boy next door was hilarious. As a two-year veteran of army tents, he looked quite young and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I worked in a department, and it was just as elegant as this. Unfortunately, it has disappeared and faded into darkness. We were known for the large display windows used to attract passers-by in the store, to get them to buy all those wonderful goods. <br /> <br /> 10/10
