I really like this show. I can easily see how it achieved cult status. It's original, and thought challenging. For some reason I have never felt the kind of resonance I could have. It does not take the kind of open doors, winter colds that were such a huge prospect. Every time I look at an episode, I find myself and insist on answering an anonymous, formless question. <br /> <br /> Before I continue, let me predict this by saying that what my opinion is and only my opinion. Different strokes for different people. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more scenes in "American Gothic" shot at night. There is too much daylight in this show, and I think it had a tendency to counteract the tension. After all, we are not afraid of the daylight. We're worried about what's in the shade. The devil is not always in the details. What we don't see is often the most frightening. <br /> <br /> Second - and that's the one that's likely to lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is a terribly talented actor ... a character actor. I followed his career with The Brady Bunch movies, which is why it bothered me to say he was probably mistaken for Lucas Buck. He is almost too petroichan, too equal to be investment of evil, even according to biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotic. He is Heroin. He is satisfactory in a kitchen lab next to a liter of Drain-O. You keep going back, even though you know the end will be madness and death. He must be like the ultimate loan shark. He is a bookmaker, but also of unspeakable condemnation. Sure. You have the money, and before long you will also have broken fingers; a cut hand, a deceased head and finally a damned soul. Going to Buck is an act of despair, and when he is there, there must be an immediate, ambitious finality - with interest compiled daily - in the air. <br /> <br /> It's all about it, and by the time you realize it, you'll know it's too late. <br /> <br /> What leads me to three: they showed Buck too often. He is in most of the scenes, in fact, which enabled him to lose his edge. The sheriff will be like mythology. He is the apocryphal expert. Many will know about him, but only an unhappy couple will really know him. He would be the bunch of flashbacks, and cryptic conversations and the perfect person to deliver this plot layout would be the deputy character portrayed by Nick Searcy. <br /> <br /> Four, the show can be very self-respecting - for a mistake, some may say - and it is typified by the whistle of "Meet Me At The Fishing Hole" in the series pilot. I think we've already determined that what Cassidy and Raimi shot was the anti-Andy Taylor. We probably didn't need the concept delivered to us by Fed Ex. I collected it within the first five minutes, so for me the piano on the head was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> These remarks are about what would have a good performance for ME. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup. In their eternal quest for LCD programming, the network played a definite role in the downfall of this series. <br /> <br /> The least that these jumble packs could have done was to air the episodes. <Br /> <br /> Actually. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a serious loss for both genre fans and casual viewers.
