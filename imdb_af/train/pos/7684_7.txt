Read all the comments is very exciting. but can anyone please tell me the name of the real artist who painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone goes to j.j. link. as the artist in the family, but there was a real family who has the right artist, and he has not yet received credit in this face. So if you don't care if someone can tell the name of the real artist, I would also like to say "work well". I know this Sight was thrown for the GOOD TIMES, but don't agree that he also touched the hearts of all of us. I want to know if he is still painting or, if he is still alive. I'd like to see his work in my home.
