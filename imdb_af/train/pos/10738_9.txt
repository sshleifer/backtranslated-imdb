SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary on the attacks on the WTC.2. French filmmakers in New York filming the actions of a NYFD face this event and make the most of it. Before 9/11 nothing really happens, giving the film an even more horrific scenario. On the day of the attack, it seems as if it is just another dull day at work, but it will soon change. As the filmmakers go on the road with the firefighters, he rolls the first crash plane. This is the only footage of the first impact. He drives the firefighters to the WTC and goes inside the building. If the second plane crashes, people understand that it's not an accident. Next time we see firefighters making plans to save as many people as possible, in the meantime we hear sound sounds, these are the sounds of people falling from the tower and falling to the ground, this is the most disturbing moment in the documentary. Then the tower falls and our French friend runs for his life. hear him breathe like a crazy man running out of the building. Then a big sandstorm shoots over him and the screen turns black, he was very happy to survive and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York. Because this documentary had so many historical footage and because the film was something completely different, this documentary would probably remain in everyone's memory. I saw the attacks at home because I had the afternoon, so it makes it even more realistic. to look. 10/10
