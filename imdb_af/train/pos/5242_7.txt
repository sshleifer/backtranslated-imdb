I really enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives insight into the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is rarely dealt with in movies, most of which tells us about the republican struggle. The second reason is the actions of the actors. I thought they had given very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that didn't hear many people from outside my own coast. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is an entertaining star movie with star performances by anyone who's thrown to the north by Irish actors. It will not move the earth, although it may open a few people's eyes to the dark world of loyalists.
