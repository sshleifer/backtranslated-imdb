There is no denial that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this movie looks like one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that a small portion of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. We then follow the lives of the residents in their struggle to find the treasure found after the bomb exploded, and keep the black market traders who soon realize that it has been released from British law. Rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own streets, because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fight back against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food for their rights. In fact, worse than it was before it all started, this is where the moral comes. That's when they lose the food they think they are beaten and ask for a surrender, just to respond to London all their food by sending food, much of it. This enables them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This movie hit is the right note throughout. The play is excellent, featuring Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It's just right, not too sentimental, and the story's morale is not forced into your throat. Well worth seeing
