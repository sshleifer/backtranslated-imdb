Five Deadly Venoms are not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fighting series in Hong Kong's film history. Director Chang Cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece. This movie started the careers of the five men who play the toxins. Meng Lo still plays a bad ass. He will continue to be in Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, will go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any hooker can apply it. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But all the brackets are good and this is one of the best.
