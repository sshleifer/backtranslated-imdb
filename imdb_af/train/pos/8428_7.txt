If it was done earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is extremely intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (once) and a philosopher-samurai who start a kind of Grange; Both run off of the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling income and their chances of upgrading some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seemingly puritanic who is killing and gambling, but secretly leaving his own perverted appetite. (He also looks like Dracula, because the villains in later Zatoichi movies tend to do.) These characters have enough meaning so they deserve to be instituted against Zatoichi, as he was originally drawn, but now he loses many of his nuances, and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man who murdered Zatoichi, needed more time than the movie, so the story looked clumsy, as if some scenes missing. Unlike this, the movie shows the virtues of most others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a vibrant, credible and unique recognizable landscape (the absence of which is evident in the occasional episode where the director does not miss it), and a technical quality of its nature: the imaginative use of limited sets so their limitations do not exist. And of course there is the keynote actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it all work. It must be one of the best-ever series in film history.
