This movie is about human relationships. Charming, funny and well written, with meaningful text. Morgan Freeman seems to have fun on the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really enjoy her acting. Woman like her is a good motivation to learn the Spanish language. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the cute Paz Vega, the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers caring about where their lives are heading. 10 items or less is about life. If you enjoy this movie, see The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. It's not an action movie or a naked comedy. It's all about human relationships.
