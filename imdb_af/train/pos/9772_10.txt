Theodore Rex is probably the greatest cinematic experience of all time, and is definitely a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel liaises with the great movie makers of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing short of breathtaking, and make any work by Spielberg firm and elementary. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the role of filmmaking to levels never expected by filmmakers. The concept of not just making a movie with a dinosaur, but adapting an action-packed, exciting detective story, has changed a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name like Theodore and an existential female police officer. humanity as we know it. The world can never be the same if you have such a beautiful beauty. Looking at Theodore Rex is very much related to the face of God and to hear Him say, "You are my beloved creation." This is one of the few movies just to die !!!
