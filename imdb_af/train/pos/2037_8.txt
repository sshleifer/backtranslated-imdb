Christopher Smith is a clear horror fan and it is made clear in his debut horror flick 'Creep'. 'Creep', though a little bit of information, seems worthy of being a true gory classic. A little less glossy than the recent American horrors (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake) follows this dark and horrific story Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and the trail of railways like hers, and a number of others en route, try to flee a murderous attacker. Although some bad reviews hit this movie, I believe it is on a tight budget and for a British production for the first time, director Smith, which really leads 'Creep' to its name. It delivers fast gory action, sometimes too fast, as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect place and the best character response at the end I've seen for a while . , 'Creep' produces some scenes that are definitely the things of nightmares.
