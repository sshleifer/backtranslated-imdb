The 1st season was incredible, the whole thought that they were adapting to the island, while mysteries were being investigated (and seen) only phenomenally; full of excitement, tons of cliff hangers, and a wonderful plot. I mean, I like the whole idea of ​​just seeing them get used to the island. And once I saw the smoke sample in the first episode, I really caught my attention. From then on I was addicted. The second season was right on the same level as the 1st season, just a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of ​​the shutters and the DHARMA initiative. The whole plot and rows of season 2 were mysterious, creepy and exciting. I loved all the tensions around others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made the season 2 incredible. Season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but great. I loved seeing the stories of the others, seeing their camp, and investigating the mysteries further. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not so good, was still breathtaking and fun, but mostly exciting! Now, the 4th season. I hoped for this season, and the few episodes are good, but then it started VERY boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise the new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot has grown old after the first few episodes ... and most of all .... Season 4 has been stripped of something that has lost a perfect series: The Secret, Stress, Comedy Mixed in (Charlie Away) and Overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.
