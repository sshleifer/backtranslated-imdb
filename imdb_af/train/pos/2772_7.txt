I have always believed that David and Bathsba were a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at the 20th century Fox, although Gregory Peck gave a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with a false eye. <br /> <br /> A lot of Biblical subjects are covered in this film, adultery, salvation, sin, punishment, and generally what God expects of His followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, even a king is in a biblical prophecy kingdom, you certainly have many perogations that are not open to the rest of us. King David has many women, including one very evil man in Jayne Meadows, who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes saw Bathsheba one evening in her garden. It seems that she is so unhappy with Uriah the Hittite, since David is quite a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captains. David sends Bath-sheba, and he is the King, she is coming a runnin ', because she also has an eye on him. <br /> <br /> What happens, a relationship, a pregnancy and a careful regular death for Uriah in a fight. But all seeing and knowing Deity has captured all these things and not only punished David and Bathsheba, but the whole kingdom of Israel is punished with drought, sickness, and pestilence. <br /> <br /> The sexist law of The Day asks Bathsheba to have a dying death. David shows weakness in his previous performance, but here he walks on the board asking for the whole thing to be put on him. He even puts hands on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an immediate death as seen in the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation is that God admires even if you are wrong, and He leaves David and forgives both of them. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they are both defeated. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is a fetching baby born in a loveless marriage. played with Uriah by Kieron Moore. The only thing that is raised by Moore is a good fight. I love Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and pretty horse's back. <br /> <br /> Nobody can lay the law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan prophet is in line with the John Brown character he played in the same intensity in two films. <br /> <br /> So when His own law called for death, why did God deliver Bathsheba and hold David on the throne. Maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. He replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I think the Christian interpretation may be that it was an indication of the New Testament that lies ahead, that one can be sinful and merciful if you ask it penitently. I will give it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you may be able to acquire a whole new theory.
