I just watched it because it was Josie Lawrence, whom I knew from <br /> <br />, from Whose Line anyway, the Wacky British improvisational <br /> <br /> comedy program. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heart-warming and magical jewel. It's exciting, touching, and <br /> <br /> romantic without being sick or sentimental. The characters are <br /> <br /> all real people, with real foibles, fears and needs. See it!
