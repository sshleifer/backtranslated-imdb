A chance meeting between a salesman and a hit changes their lives. It's a strange movie that works, an impressive effort for writer-director Shepard. Brosnan is in a daring childlike role that is far from James Bond's apostasy, surprisingly effective as the lonely hit that begins to bend under the stress of his work, but is unable to emotionally connect with someone to help him cope. Kinnear is as good as the salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life. Davis is fine like Kinnear's flirtatious wife. Mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it is fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
