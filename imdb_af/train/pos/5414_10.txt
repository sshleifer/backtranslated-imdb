This fortunate 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem, as well as his novel "Soldiers Three," qualifies as first-class entertainment over the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more knock-on blows with his crunched fists than he did in all his movies. In the furthest India, this sifted yarn dwells on the exploitation of three rugged British sergeants and their indigenous aquifer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who calls a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen of "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of The Dawn Patrol), is a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-hitting, and lovers of alpha-men, whose years will be history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Of course, Cutter and MacChesney cut a variety of schemes to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors give them back in action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so he can't accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun here looks at the principals trying to overwhelm each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in great style and scope, as our heroes rage with a Thuggees army. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black-and-white cinematography.
