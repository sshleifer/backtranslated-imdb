If you've read Mother's Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just have to watch the movie, you need to understand that you need to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - which is beyond his story Vonnegut lie and that you cannot put a human mind on the screen. His humor and humor cannot be translated through a script or even the best acting. I believe this movie is bigger than the key questions Vonnegut asks in his book, but the regular cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean the movie misses the point? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not attempt to recover the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those who are too lazy to change a page). It succeeds in taking the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and proposing it in a framework without pretext. I have seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and lose his grip on his own vessel. I won't place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it's on its own as one worth watching. By taking Vonnegut's "voice" from the movie's narrative or trying to insert it, Mother Night can tell his story brilliantly and preserve the basic lessons of the story without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
