The Sopranos (now ready to end) is the highlight of adult television and drama. When the Sopranos hit the point, it really touched the point. Using good writing and good actors (most of them are extras from Goodfellas), the series is out loud to progress in a satisfactorily unpredictable and exceptional way. The title is James Gandolfini, for all intensive purposes, Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco, who owns herself. The series also boasts a large collection of tribal money to push the plot together in any way needed (usually violence and foul language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are good secondary characters that make each episode more interesting. Seasonal extras are also worthwhile, including names like Steve Buscemi (big!), Joe Pantoliano (big!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of contemporary mafia societies which, despite the rare bad story lines, succeed in being unique TV. Symbolism and simple story lines, dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create confusing stories and relationships that are resolved at the end of each season to create another perfect HBO package. Beware ...
