I read over 100 of the Nancy Drew books, and if you're not bright enough to catch yet, Nancy Drew was the movie of a younger Nancy Drew, not the 18-year-old who didn't go to school. some of the books are about. That was when she was sixteen. Of course she would not be as clever as the one in the book, since she was only in the 10th grade. Other than that, I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was sometimes funny. I thought Emma Roberts did a good job. She was articulate, a character and cute. I like the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because of course they were not old enough to be in a serious relationship as they did in the books. It was a nice PG movie I thoroughly enjoy because, unlike most people of my age, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or curse.
