Although the album elements after "The Eighth Day" seem to have been done many times, the movie still has a lot of spark, secret and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain on my favorite list, the movie leaves us still many emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001's tasteless "The Closet", shows her part, scared to overreact (rightly, the role could easily be ruined if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt that the part needed a little more realism for it, and more focused on the character itself, rather than merely the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Don't go into this movie and expect the dark humor and unexpected twists of "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not defective, movie
