This movie has never been viewed recently at TCM and found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer from Nazi occupation of local towns, like many other European cities, for example, Norway. The First World War was over and people in this town were still busy with their lost soldiers and the wounded who always created War. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town. He was a German educated and was not very happy with the Polish people nor did he fully accept him. As the Hitler party grew into power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return to this small Polish town and punish for their treatment against him who was really in his mind. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played an excellent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle motors are shown in this photo with Jewish people going to the Nazi gas chambers. If you haven't seen this movie, give it a little of your time; This movie is much on earth for a 1944 movie and a story you won't soon forget.
