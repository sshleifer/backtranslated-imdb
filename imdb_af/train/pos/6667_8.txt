OK. There are people who should not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Don't see it if you don't like satire or black humor. 2) Don't like it if you take offense at The Watchmen_. 3) Don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, running, don't go to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's weird, it's a glorious record of every bad superhero click known to man. Dependent prejudice in junior high humor does not destroy the low-key fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as some amusing smaller parts by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see that Louise Lasser also gets work.) I laughed completely. Quite insignificant, somewhat strange, but-good-.
