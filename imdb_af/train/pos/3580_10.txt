I don't think a movie like this will be released today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters, and the plot is not full of circles and turns to keep you on the edge of your chair. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has: an interesting study in how families are treated with grief. How when the language for healing and overwhelming loss makes us mute, and we rather rely on raw emotions. Sadness without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the main character (a young boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother) in the film is given more than his fair share. He eventually left and moved with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who made it clear to him that it was an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but had to hear those words from his parents and receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved about this movie: the lack of dialogue. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical response, facial expressions. And with the slower pace of the movie you can really watch the reaction of the actors. Something we don't do much with today's movies. <br /> <br />
