If you were ever sad because you couldn't find a movie on DVD, it was probably Delirious that you were looking for. How often do you laugh when you get to know comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his greatest time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie made a big deal of his inspiration. Having been older and seeing Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I realize two things: Everybody Eddie's, while Eddie got LOVINGLY from Richard. That's the big difference: Eddie was originally, funny, challenging, considerate ?? and more. He was something never seen before. He was everything we ever needed. Eddie Murphy is boring and old these days? but once he was the king, and delirious was the largest castle ever built. Actually one of the funniest routines of all time.
