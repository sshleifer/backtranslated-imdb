Enjoy this movie on TCM and watch a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) detective, just as he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". Back in the 1930s William Powell played in the Philo Vance series and in this photo, well-known veteran actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) became one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case where a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot was found dead and Archer was in a room bolted from inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) played a major supporting role and was Frank Morgan's brother who appeared in Oz 1939's wizard. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath) appears in many of these Philo's Vance films and also has a good performance in Robin Hood with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the most likely actor can be the killer. Enjoy a good Classic from the past.
