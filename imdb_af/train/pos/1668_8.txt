Artimisia was last night last night. At first I didn't think I'd like it, but I haven't seen how to sleep and nothing else was going on. I continued to look and feel through the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi-recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level and not reality, I loved it much more than the usual biographies or costume drama. Great play, great camera photos, good music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)
