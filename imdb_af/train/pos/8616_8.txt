As a platoon of G.I. of the Japanese army had to be sent 400 years in the middle of the feudal wars, which led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Big pitch right? The movie does exactly what appears on the can. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the authors have not bothered to explain the scientific mumbo jumbo of time transportation, usually ridiculous in scientific films. No, how or why. They just did. But the time-travel series itself is trippy like hell and pretty pretty, if not a little dated. Not as stupid as one would think. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie follows the foreground to a T. But as it loses some steam with the different subplots that follow the GI's arrival to medieval Japan, come up with a devastating battle order . This is undoubtedly the main thing of the day. The whole concept and the expansion of the movie itself probably came from this simple pitch: What if G.I. equipped with the latest in modern warfare, Samurais had to fight? And the boy delivers it. <br /> <br /> The main battle sequence stretching over half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action / war movies. Not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it is also a tremendous mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique sites like G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else would you get the chance to have tanks, ninja with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? The G.I. peloton led by Lieutenant Iba tears literally through hundreds of extras, awarding them with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> One-footed, this mish-mash style is firmly rooted in the vast jidishi epic of Kurosawa's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners, while others are in western action and war films. There are stylistic touches (such as the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari have in mind about Keoma. Japanese theater has always been influenced by Westerns and other Hollywood works and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turns this east-facing west crucible into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmakers make the whole thing serious and the movie is amazing. Not that tongue-in-the-herd mentality is completely absent, it's just that it's not trying to sniff at such bad-it-good audiences who like to laugh at their movies. The budget was probably solid, as evidenced by the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai kitty) and special effects. The camera work and editing are all, in fact, almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not his fault either. There are many "song" scenes where all sorts of 70-year-old Japanese rock, disco and land songs play about montages (there's a band scene, a love scene, a "war is hell" scene, etc.). The songs themselves are pretty lame and wheat and detract from the whole thing. Although it comes in 140 minutes, it usually flies like a bullet. A few more scenes, flashes and subplots in the first half could be cut for a tighter effect. <br /> <br /> The film also deserves a mention, with such prominent names as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all who hit the right notes .
