I sat with my kids watching this movie. We all found this to be a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth-grade bully starts with him and it leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> Betting is made and Billy has just as much time to eat 10 worms. From this point, the bully and his friends are trying to get Billy sick with uncomfortable cooking, baking or baking worms, so he can lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to be more and more everyone, even the bull friends. <br /> <br /> I won't tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you'll just have to look to find out, but I think if you like good family movies, you'll find this one love. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all the girls and they enjoyed it very much.
