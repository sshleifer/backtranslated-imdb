It's probably the best short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is wonderful, especially Amanda Burton, whose character goes from scary to sweat to sadness to grief and then some ... She does a wonderful job balancing Rachels / Carlas feelings and the pain of someone who lost, working out, it is so credible that it feels more like a true life story and then a drama. The other actors are, of course, wonderful as they usually are in British TV / Film. The end, which I'm not going to give, is fantastic, especially because you don't really get one ... (you'll get what I mean after you see it). It is worth buying and seeing. and again and if you are not affected, you are a cold-hearted person.
