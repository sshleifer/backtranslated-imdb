This movie looks well remembered as the time that Tom & Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for some time, but predictable, it gets sour. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless battle with a pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat involving the two plus Butch the dog at the beginning and end of the brief. I enjoyed it a bit and you have to try to capture it on Cartoon Network.
