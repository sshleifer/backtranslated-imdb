Enjoy downloading this movie on a late let TV and it kept my interest throughout the picture. This wonderful yet mysterious English home, with evil search decorations and furniture and rooms that make you wonder why someone wants to rent or even own this house. There are four (4) stories about this house, and every resident meets all sorts of problems. You will see the beautiful lake and pond around the house and also the lovely song of birds, but don't be fooled, there is horror everywhere in the place. Peter Cushing, 'Black Jack', '80 gives a good performance as one of the homeowners and even Christopher Lee, 'Curse of the Crimson Altar', 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks (Jane Reid) a wonderful exciting story together, his daughter, for some reason, likes to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you like creepy, horrible and mysterious movies, with lots of surprises, it's the FILM FOR YOU !!!!
