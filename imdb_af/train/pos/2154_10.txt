I've seen this movie many times and I'll never get tired. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is hysterically funny and at the same time, it is becoming quite alive. For those of you who are not a fan of "subtitles" or strange film in general, open your mind. It's a great movie for the "beginner" because the story is so entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's just a big laugh for one of the main characters called Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've ever seen!) <br /> <br /> I can't even think of this movie without smiling! I love it ... and I think most people will.
