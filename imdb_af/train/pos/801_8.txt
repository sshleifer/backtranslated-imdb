I suppose JEDI is now regarded chronologically as the "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, just like some of them. I liked how directly this successor returned to the EMPIRE, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't that bad. I enjoyed the exciting chase in the woods, and I felt there was very good sense of emotion with this chapter. The end (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully weaves 6 chapters into a wonderful story of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans have hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films, but rather a family member for these movies rather late in life and don't miss what I didn't know yet. I think he made these 6 movies. perfect as a whole entity. Oh, and wrong - Carrie Fisher looks nice in her thin outfit.
