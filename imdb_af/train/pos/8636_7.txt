So-so thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip from the west. The latter couple are investigating infamous murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the lamb (unknown to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all companion. It's a good role and the story moves together, but Pitt is not ridiculously frightening as a serial killer, though it's one of his better earlier roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on "Homicide: Life on the Street" or in the short series "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
