I'm really surprised at how little in the movie was done on the Columbine massacre. There is not a huge documentary, very mysterious. Fortunately, we are awarded the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant who did the same fine ELEPHANT. Two things take the event. The idea is that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery. There is something that is ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivation of the two murderers, and what they actually managed to carry it further Fantasy in the terrible reality. ZERO DAY, which allegedly consists of video tapes made by the shooters and found after the event, is absolutely sound. Even if you know where it is going, you still hope it won't "go" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is sobering. The film is awesome from top to bottom, from director to screenplay (not much improvised, although it looks very spontaneous) to the two main players and also supporting players. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that upset me. Okay, so we can't understand why the shooters would do what they did, but surely one of the contributors was their ANGER. Yet these boys do not really look angry. They might say something to indicate they are, but they did not convince me that they had ANYTHING in them that forced them to kill innocent people. But it still leaves me feeling "why ???" that director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will crawl on you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH people could just make a cartoon for the kind of success these guys had.
