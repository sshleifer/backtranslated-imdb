This could be the WWE's 2nd best PPV of the year to Wrestlemania, it was a great surprise! John Cena had an excellent match in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retains his IC title in a short, messy match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a rather violent table over Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a very good fit with Kidman which was surprising to me. Booker T defeated the Big Show in a no dq match, at one point Booker T donated the scissors to Big Show and sent him throughout the table. In a stupid decision of the WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from the test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the game of the night that filled it with big highs and RVD retained its title by a DQ so I was glad he kept the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little or nothing. And in the main event, the Rock became the first worldwide WWE world champion to defeat both Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a threefold threat match. Overall, it's probably the WWE's 2nd best PPV 2002! 10/07
