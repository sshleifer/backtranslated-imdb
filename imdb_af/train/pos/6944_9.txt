For Anthony Mann the Western 'legend' - and 'legend' makes the best movie! Mann's work was full of intensities and passions, visually dramatic and the action was always excitingly photographed. <br /> <br /> Stewart, a brave actor with the ability to show anger, neurosis and cruelty, made with Anthony Mann, five remarkable Westerners: "Winchester '73;" "Bend the River;" "The Naked Spur;" "The Far Country;" and "The man of Laramie." <br /> <br /> In "Winchester" 73, Stewart reveals his darker side. He offers all the reserves of anger, inner ambivalence and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences have so far failed to catch. <br /> <br /> A carefully selected cast enhances the performance in fine style: Shelley Winters is at her best Dan Duryea perfect as the evil, sick psychopathic villain; John McIntire resembles the unscrupulous character; Charles Drake as good as the man who tries to meet his evil man; and a very young Rock Hudson, trying the role of an Indian Chief ... <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly valued gun in the Dodge City Kansas of 1876. Stewart and his estranged brother, who has a different name (Stephen McNally), compete hard to take possession of, and although Stewart wins, McNally puts it off and sets off a long way with Stewart in pursuit. What does the quest for element of the demonic mean is Stewart's determination to avenge his father's death in the hands of the same apostate brother? a vengeance by a prolonged fraternal hatred ... <br /> <br /> Photographed in beautiful Black & White, the film is so powerful and arrested, with a deep sense and intense concentration, not just by Stewart, but by all the supporting characters ... Look for a promising newcomer, Tony Curtis, the soldier who gets the gun after the Indian attack ...
