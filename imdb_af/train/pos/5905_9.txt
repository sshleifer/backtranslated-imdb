It's a very well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made meaningful theater and this is my favorite movie by her. This movie had won the National Award and would choose to represent India at the Oscars. That is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', going to the Oscars this year, from India. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian movies) on IMDb is missing and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar plays a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and the crew were not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this movie are not given, even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this movie. There was not even a single voice for "Doghi". <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and unfortunately the song and dance series escapes, not entangled in glittering shine and half-designs. It is a real life, psychological story made with scarce understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" which can be roughly translated as "two women" is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. This is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave doesn't dare in many subplots, making it a very difficult movie to direct. The whole movie is in a non-descriptive remote village in Maharashtra, and the screen rarely goes far from home of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. <br /> <br /> The movie opens and we are introduced to the whole house, preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father is a hardworking farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing that they want in their simple lives. But on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's husband-man meets with a fatal accident. Gauri's father can't bear the tragic news and suffers a great stroke. Without a strong, working member, the house could have fallen apart, but Gauri's mother saw the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but can't end up meeting. But her life is still easier than Gauri. Superstitions, that people try to forget half-heartedly, make Gauri an evil happiness. She was wiped out of society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help she accepted his proposal. He took Gauri down to Mumbai where she was made to work in brothels. Gauri sends the money she earns home and improves their conditions. Gauri gives her life for that of her family. <br /> <br /> But when Gauri returns for Krishna's wedding, her mother doesn't come out to meet her. She did not leave Krishna near her and did not allow Gauri to go to the guests. She loves Gauri, but fear of Krishna's life. It completely breaks Gauri and she decides to return to her unhappy life. But Krishna runs out and keeps Gauri. She begged her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand with her. Promises that they would face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> Nothing is needed in this movie. Everything is needed and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai, but what she does is never told ?? The subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It's just the bare story, which is very important in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is a responsible movie. It is respectful of the topic it deals with. It's respect for his audience? It doesn't think they have the mental ability of a four-year-old. <br /> <br /> The play is first time. The direction is wonderful ?? the silence carries the story forward in a way, no words can have. The script is well researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a good theater is bound to "Doghi".
