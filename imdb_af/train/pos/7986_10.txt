This is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. This is by far the best I have seen depicting the current reality in Latin America ... kidnapping, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and heartless evil against innocent victims. Denzel Washinton, according to me, gives the most moving performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning was wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The movie is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is great as always. Walken lifts me on the screen like no other actor. I'd love to see more of them both. The authentic places are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many well-known Latin actors in the film, making it more interesting for people who are familiar with Latin American cinema. I recommend this movie.
