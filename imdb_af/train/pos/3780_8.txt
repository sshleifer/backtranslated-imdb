It was only after my second show, that I realized two things about this movie: 1) I enjoyed it very much, and 2) it because its execution is definitely sharper than the premise itself guarantees. I laughed my way through the movie before it seemed to me to prolong my initial protest - valleys and lures and airheadedness (even good * outdated airheadedness) are just not inherently funny, especially when signed out. But although the film's momentum sputtering towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout even the more uncomfortable jokes (eg Ted fails Recognizing a certain resident of hell works as effortlessly as the whites (eg the challenge). And the team of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the team of Bill and Ted (who only separated one scene in the whole movie, disaster if they aren't fit) remains completely unpunished. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found that the first movie is only sporadically entertaining - bad different comic sensibilities there seem to be.) <br /> <br /> I give it a 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
