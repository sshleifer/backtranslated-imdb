Excellent movie by Thaddeus O'Sullivan with strong performances by an army of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with arid subject matter, and the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of Belfast's 1970s has been effectively captured. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify both sides in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting in trouble. On the other hand, it is about a loyalist gang who intends to spread violence. Very interesting and grateful, entertaining. Don't expect any laughs. 7 out of 10.
