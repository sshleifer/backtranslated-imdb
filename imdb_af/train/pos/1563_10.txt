I loved this episode. It's so nice that all 5 of them get up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are in the lead! I just hope Clark will join the Justice League, and we'll follow this group of heroes all over the world! =) It was very exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a Watchtower, it will be such a cool thing to do next to the Daily Planet because she doesn't have superpowers. I also want to find out what types of subjects Lex will use for 33.1, I wonder what other kinds of powers other people in the world have !!!
