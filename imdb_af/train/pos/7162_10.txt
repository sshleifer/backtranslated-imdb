This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read and liked the book, but this movie elaborates on everything the book has revealed. The play is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight, Sir plays, a very evil character. This movie has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you addicted all the way to the end where everything is joined together for a good end. I also love the way it is directed, flipping back and forth between contemporary and Stanley's ancestors' stories. The story was written by Louis Sachar, but it seems this story is made for film, and Andrew Davis does a good job. I definitely recommend it to everyone who enjoys good movies.
