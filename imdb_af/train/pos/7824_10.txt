As someone old enough knows, South Africa has suffered for a long time under the dirty, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely suppressed the black population. One of the best known anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods tried to get Biko's message to the world. <br /> <br /> In the "Cry Freedom" Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is recorded on trumpets. charges. When Woods tries to spread Biko's word, he and his family are under threat of attack, and they are eventually forced to flee the country. The last scene shows that the police shot at the protesters. <br /> <br /> As one of the two films (along with a world section) that helped to exacerbate the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" is on display as the best work ever for everyone involved.
