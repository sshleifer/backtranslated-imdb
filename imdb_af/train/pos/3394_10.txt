I accidentally watched this movie after buying it as the B side on the Omega Man DVD. The Omega man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the start, which was the inspiration 28 days later, the rest are just the things of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a completely different league. I'm sure this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie I have never seen before. Heston casually comes to bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people are being bought by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest who takes confession and is shot by the confessor. Okay, maybe it's been done since then - but there aren't many movies that are as consistent as this one. And what is the slope between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily I saw this movie without knowing the end - which apparently is scarce. Then I watched it again and enjoyed all the clues that made the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and also some good sets. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
