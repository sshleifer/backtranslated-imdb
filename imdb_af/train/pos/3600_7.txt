At first glance, I expected this movie to be discouraged because I thought the plot would be so excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read earlier in published comments, I agree that the feminist part in this movie does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character exaggerated her position as a woman. It is as if Guzman is offered as a spine, unlike her classmates. So I was surprised at the story. I thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable end. Perhaps it would be a better idea to give the plot a radical twist so the viewer is a little more surprised. <br /> <br /> I would also like to say that Rodriguez respects the way she threw her character away. I can't really explain why, but especially in love shows she convinced me. It just looked, I think. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 out of 10, just because of the dull last half hour.
