NB: Spoilers are. This great movie is so many things, all successful: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, what-true syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, global bioterrorism and an emerging love story. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the story's distorted timeline generates very heated debate - testifying to the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, look at the thesis at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Wow! Such temporary emphasis mostly speaks to the brilliant plot, coming from the beautiful work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's "La Jetee". Without a doubt, it is one of the most successful, fascinating time travel movies ever invented. But there are many other levels discussed here. <br /> <br /> The movie's true genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time travel in the minds of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing the best job of his career here). His journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine hunting warrior to becoming the victim's victim? and back. The other broad sweep of the story increasingly highlights the personal story between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (the wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shift / opposing views of these two characters. For me everything is in the fleabag hotel room scene. At this point, James ?? once gripped by an unwavering determination ?? Now crept into absolute doubt about his own reality; while Dr Railly ?? the cool and rational scientist ?? eventually became very convinced of his terrible predictions after picking up James's evidence. Her desperation to go to James and keep up with the mission shows how far she has come. <br /> <br /> Gilliam cares about these characters, especially through the tension of tension that is affecting their lives. The balance between emotional roller coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle / thriller is beautiful. And the unbundling at the airport is passionately intense because we see it coming so clearly through James's dreams. It is here, just after James decided to stop the whole mess? and does his madness fight more than ever? that he walks back to the board and does what is necessary for humanity. See Jose and the gun ?? (Just before that, the references to Hitchcock's Vertigo and identity link / confusion are brilliant.) This is a movie that is lost among thinking people. It not only keeps up with repeated views, but requires it. "Twelve Monkeys" are intelligent, challenging, bizarre, funny and exciting things. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is excellent, especially Brad Pitt steals all his screens and shows great flexibility as Jeffery Goines, crazy and spoiled. but ever the survivor. And there is David Morse as dr. Peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves its powerful motivation) and Christopher Plummer as dr. Goines. But the biggest awards belong to Terry Gilliam, who over here - just scarce - his outstanding "Brazil." (Many parallel, of course, especially the lonely fighter who tries to escape his crumbling environment: ambience, laziness without.) Every frame of this movie has its unique stamp and tone. The soundtrack is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> This is one of the great achievements of the 90's, a real favorite of mine, and sure to last for a long time to come.
